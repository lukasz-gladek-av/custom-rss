			<p>Borderlands 4 is currently out on PC, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">IGN</a>, it's already become the biggest Borderlands game on Steam ever, an hour after it went live, with a concurrent player count that dwarfs the rest of its predecessors. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this writing, Borderlands 4 has 201,273 players in-game. The next closest concurrent player count for games in the Borderlands series goes to Borderlands 2, which has a max concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/49520/charts/">124,678 players</a>. Borderlands 3 only has a peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/">93,820</a>.</p>



<p>Players around the world who are intending to play the game on PC can jump onto Steam or the Epic Games Store and jump into Borderlands 4 right now, while console players will have to wait a few more hours, depending on where you live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As a reminder, Steam is not a full picture of any game's player base, since we never get to see console player concurrent numbers in the same way, and as it currently stands with Borderlands 4, the game isn't even available to some console players across the world.</p>



<p>That said, this is an undeniably strong start for Gearbox's latest entry in the franchise, which is making a return after what many regarded an abysmal previous release with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/borderlands-3/"> Borderlands 3</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you seen this guy on TikTok playing games in the most serene places imaginable? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer">The Scenic Gamer</a> travels all over playing games with iconic locations while he is set up in their real-life counterparts (or the closest thing he can find to it). He’s slaying <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>at the beach and&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em> in the center of Yellowstone National Park — all on an old Toshiba CRT. Dude’s living the dream. But how’s he managing to power that TV and Nintendo GameCube without an outlet for miles? If you want to follow in his footsteps, <strong>you’ll need portable power station such as the Anker 521</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">The mini generator is normally listed at $200, but for a limited time you can get it for 20% off.</a> That brings the price down by $40 so you only have to pay $160.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Anker 521 portable power station comes equipped with six different ports to supply you with all your power needs when out in the wild. Along the front of the unit, you’ll find two AC ports, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet. You can recharge or power up to six devices at once.</p>

<p>The power station is capable of fast, reliable charging. The Anker 521 can keep a 40W mini fridge running for over five hours. Keep a fan going for nearly six. Or recharge a 13Wh camera more than 15 times over. A 12Wh smartphone can be brought back from zero to 100% 16.5 times over. Power times can be extended further by using power-saving mode. Featured on the front of the power station is a LED display providing info on the power output and remaining battery life of the anker 521 itself.</p>



<h2>Optional Solar Panel</h2>
<p>Then when the power station itself needs a recharge, it can be brought back up to at least 80% in just two and a half hours when plugged into the adapter that’s packaged with it. If you’re taking the power station on an extended getaway in the outdoors, you can also recharge it via solar energy. As an optional add-on, you can bundle your Anker 521 with a 100W solar panel. It can be adjusted to four different angles so you can maximize the energy it’s able to take in based on the sun’s position overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Anker 521, grabbing it for just $160.</a> If you choose to bundle with the solar panel, it’s 30% off from $499 which brings it to just $350.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an upcoming Daggerheart charity stream. The aptly named Critical Role TGIT stream is a charity event, featuring both a live auction event and a Daggerheart one-shot set in the radical 1990s.</p>

<h2>The Critical Role TGIT Stream Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official blog post, the Critical Role TGIT stream will go live on Thursday, September 18 on eBay Live, Twitch, YouTube, and the Critical Role streaming platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beacon</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=3zS1whLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=is2cqowM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The details on the post are scarce, but illustrative. The event will include Matt Mercer as the Gamemaster, Critical Role Foundation President and voice-actor Ashley Johnson, Will Friedle (<em>Batman Beyond</em>, <em>Boy Meets World</em>), Danielle Fishel (<em>Wizards Beyond Waverly Place</em>, <em>Shifting Gears</em>), Rider Strong (<em>Cabin Fever</em>), Jodie Sweetin (<em>Full House</em>), and Christine Lakin (<em>Step By Step</em>).</p>

<p>Those players will play a one-shot adventure using the blockbuster TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> set in a 90s-themed campaign frame. So get ready for Y2K anxiety, jnco jeans, neon, Tamagotchis,&nbsp; grunge music, and more. Given the actors at this table, expect a lot of cheeky references and inside jokes on top of these aesthetic trappings.</p>

<p>But this nostalgic time at the table is one part of the Critical Role TGIT stream. While the game is happening in real time, various pieces of Critical Role merchandise will be auctioned off through eBay Live. A portion of the proceeds will go to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT).</p>

<p>The NCWIT provides 1,600 universities, companies, non-profits, and government organizations with resources for recruiting, retaining, and advancing women through industry and entrepreneurial careers in computers and technology nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, some proceeds will go to the Critical Role Foundation's emergency relief fund. The Critical Role Foundation is a non-profit organization that partners with like-minded organizations to create grants. Those partners include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tonight-critical-role-asks-how-do-you-want-to-do-this-stephen-colbert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Nose Day</a>, Shanti Bhavan, and the First Nations Development Institute.</p>

              <p>The next <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie is out April 2026 and it still doesn’t have an official title. Unofficially, however, the titles has seemingly leaked thanks to recently registered domain names, and all signs point to a riff on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476">Per Wario64</a>, the domain name supermariogalaxy.movie was registered by NBCUniversal earlier this month, followed by&nbsp;supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com on September 10. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">redirect to Universal’s homepage</a> and match up with the conventions used for the domains for the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EHknBYD082">https://t.co/EHknBYD082</a> (Super Mario Galaxy film) domain also registered by NBC Universal on Sept 3rd.</p> <p>For the first movie, Universal used <a href="https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS">https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS</a> for the movie's website (now points to VOD/Disc links since it's been out for years) <a href="https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI">https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/2uvjPnIwJQ">pic.twitter.com/2uvjPnIwJQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This backs up a leak from months ago when a photo of labels featuring the title <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> on Old Spice deodorant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/">started making the rounds online</a>. It wasn’t clear at the time if it was an elaborate fake or not, though the renders showing Yoshi and Luigi looked authentic. The latest information about the domain names suggests it was legit.</p>

 <p>“Can’t believe that the <em>Mario</em> movie sequence was leaked by an Old Spice merch, of all things,” the YouTube account NintendoFan <a href="https://x.com/NFan_Official/status/1966200638213337371">posted on X</a>. “What a crazy timeline! I loved Yoshi’s look on that little can. Now it’s just a matter of waiting to see it in 4K.”</p> <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ended with Bowser defeated and Mario and Luigi returning to their lives in Brooklyn while a post-credits sequent revealed a hatching Yoshi egg somewhere in the sewers. There weren’t any other strong leads on where the second movie would take things, but the apparent title suggests at the very least the gang is headed into space. Maybe to try and find a home for Yoshi?</p>

   <p>2007’s <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for the Wii sees the plumber hopping from planet to planet in order to free magical stars for Rosalina’s ship, called the Comet Observatory, which got messed up by Bowser. The game features a star character, Lumalee, who already appeared in the first movie. At the same time, <em>The Super </em><em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a reimagining of the series lore more than a remix of it, so <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will likely have its own twist on the elements of the game, if it borrows directly from them at all.</p> <p>One last thing worth noting is that the Old Spice art showed a Tostarenan from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> hanging behind Luigi. So whatever Nintendo and Minions studio Illumination Entertainment are planning, it’s likely much bigger than any one <em>Mario</em> game. The second movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 is out now on PC, and a number of issues have cropped up as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/" data-ref-id="1100-6534670">the game sets records on Steam</a>. On the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/44493923901971-Borderlands-4-PC-Troubleshooting-and-Optimization-Guide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands Support site</a>, Gearbox lays out some of the known issues so far and has provided workarounds for some issues.</p><h2>Compiling shaders</h2><p>To begin with, Gearbox reminded people that it's a good idea to ensure your drivers are updated, since doing that alone can fix some issues. For issues compiling shaders, Gearbox said they should take about 10 minutes to compile, and if it's taking longer, you can try rebooting the game and your system.</p><p>If that doesn't sort out the issue, you can clear the shader cache.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann has seemingly revealed that The Last of Us Part III is, at the very least, an idea that's been floated at the studio. In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>, Druckmann says Naughty Dog debated going straight into Part III after completing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">Part II</a>, but that ultimately, the team decided to move forward on what we now know as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While a Part III to The Last of Us seems like a no-brainer, considering how well this franchise does for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, Druckmann has given mixed signals over the years. When <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> dropped last year, it eventually included <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/grounded-ii-the-making-of-documentary-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-be-released"><em>Grounded II</em>, a documentary about the making of the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Near the end of it, Druckmann said, "For years now, I haven't been able to find that concept [for Part III], but recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have a conept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."&nbsp;</p><p>But then, in a March 2025 <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/"><em>Variety</em></a><em> </em>interview, Druckmann, when asked about a potential Part III, said, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't be on there being more of The Last of Us. This could be it."&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <em>Variety</em>, Druckmann has seemingly revealed that Naughty Dog, at one point, had plans regarding a Part III game in its Last of Us franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about potential Intergalactic sequels, Druckmann said, "We don't tend to plan too much in the future, because we find – and this is something I inherited, it's just the Naughty Dog culture – that we do our best work when it's something we're really excited about, really passionate about.</p><p>"Just to give you an example, when we finished The Last of Us Part II, and that was highly successful for us, we were debating whether we should just go straight into The Last of Us 3, and we had a really long period where we looked at ideas for maybe what could be in that game."&nbsp;</p><p>The team looked at Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, and its "sci-fi thing," though, and Druckmann said what is now Intergalactic is where the team's passion led it.&nbsp;</p><p>So for now, it sounds like a third Last of Us game is on the theoretical or potential table as Naughty Dog continues work on Intergalactic.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nature, a game about creating an ecosystem and evolving its inhabitants, is not exactly a new idea. Publisher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/NorthStarGameStudio/AllGames/page/25D1D1E6-4BE8-460C-88A5-76F141CDAAE7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>North Star Games</u></a> first released a similar title, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xd5V?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, in 2014. Evolution spawned multiple expansions and spinoffs over the subsequent years, to much acclaim. Designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/3245/dominic-crapuchettes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominic Crapuchettes</a> just can’t let this idea go as 2025’s Nature is the latest iteration of this longstanding series. I’m glad he’s stuck with it, because this new standalone title is the most splendid variation yet.</p><div catalogid="63e640fa-0407-4587-ba23-f4273724f4dd" id="227874"><div id="227874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution</a>, players steward a number of distinct species they must feed and protect. You gain a new budding lifeform in each of the four rounds, with species consisting of a size and population. The former represents its overall mass and scale, while the latter is the number of animals in the genus. So a small herd of elephant-like creatures would have a size of four but only a couple of population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is that each species also consists of up to three trait cards. This is the nerve center of the design, as it consists of a nuanced card system that elicits difficult strategic decisions. The biggest concern is hand management, as well as guiding the evolutionary force in response to a shifting environment. Each animal is fighting for survival, and that includes gathering precious limited food from the central watering hole, or possibly going the carnivore route and hunting for sustenance. Your ability to work toward these goals and curb threats rests in the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trait cards function primarily as evolving mechanisms for defense or food gathering. You can play a Fast card on one of your species to help them outrun predators. Or maybe armored plating to provide a hardy shell. Similarly, claws may help you gather plants more efficiently, or provide an offensive bonus when hunting other creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s marvelous is that the system is ostensibly a tableau builder. This is a style of game, popularized by games like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrjln?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B000YLAOEW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Race for the Galaxy</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P2xO?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08F65MX4L" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>7 Wonders</u></a>, where players place cards in their own personal area, creating an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine</a> to generate points or resources. Nature twists this formula to create dynamic isolated tableaus that represent player-crafted species. So instead of managing a single tableau, players construct and manipulate several small sets of various properties. It’s a clever concept, using an existing mechanism to craft an ecosystem of evolving entities that must continually change in order to adapt to their environment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environmental pressures that incentivize adaptation are mainly a result of the hunter system. When you are playing cards during your turn, you may always slap a hunter trait onto one of your species. This makes them carnivores, shirking the watering hole and instead seeking to outmaneuver prey and feed on their population. A reason to do this is that the watering hole plant food is limited, particularly late game when the number and population of species has escalated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predators also devour population, effectively harming opponent’s tableaus and weakening their species. Population and feeding lead to points in this game, as each token of food devoured gets banked for end game scoring. Feeding off another player’s pack not only scores you points, but it also lowers the ceiling on their food consumption. It’s a brutal aspect of the game, but one rooted in player interaction and evolutionary force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these processes are identical to Nature’s predecessor, Evolution. The reason for this new edition of the game was to unify the design and its many branching expansions under a single family of products that all function together. This also allows for the Nature base game to be streamlined and simplified for a new generation of players. Crapuchettes' goal here is to craft a game that offers a welcoming enough foundation for a wide audience, while allowing for endless expansion to layer complexity and nuance atop that sturdy base. Nature is intended to appeal to virtually any level of gamer, hobbyist or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">newcomer</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By at measure, Nature is predominantly a success. There are several expansion modules that add things such as dinosaurs, flying creatures, random events, and environments such as the Amazon or Arctic Tundra. Most add a new deck of trait cards which are kept separate from the primary set of cards. The unified implementation makes for easier integration, with setup and teardown being quite simple. The framework also allows for multiple expansions to be used together in order to tweak the experiences. This is the strongest quality of Nature, as it plays quite differently depending on the chosen content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Say for instance you want a more violent and exciting game. The Jurassic expansion adds more nifty tools for predators, so that’s an easy inclusion. But tossing in the Amazon setting will also introduce a bluffing element with hidden traits, which will ratchet up the tension and result in more daring attacks. Next time you play you can swap Jurassic for Flight, which will result in a far less confrontational session and instead focus on flocks of birds migrating as a new avenue for scoring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The extensibility is a core asset of the design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The extensibility is a core asset of the design. Nature as a streamlined and simplified experience on its own would be disappointing for those of who have played this game system previously. But I don’t think comparing the core set of Nature to Evolution: Climate is fair. The breadth and scope of each product needs to be evaluated, and Nature’s ability to evolve and plug in new content in a manner similar to its own player-driven trait selection is frankly, a magnificent adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main drawback to Nature is the somewhat obtuse feeding process. The process involves grabbing food from the watering hole equal to the size of your species, and is completely independent of the population. Additionally, bigger creatures don’t need to eat any more food, which is odd. This works mechanically and is an important aspect of the system, but it’s unintuitive and something players can struggle to internalize. The rest of the design is elegant, with the card play being clean and consistent and everything flowing extraordinarily well. I’m not sure the design itself could be carved away any further, but it’s a lingering question due to this mechanism not sitting perfectly flush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Nature meets its overall objective. It has a modest ruleset, and massive potential. Inserting a new expansion is seamless and the additional rules heft is only a couple of paragraphs. The core system is still sharp. It conveys its themes of evolutionary biology effortlessly. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/north-star-video-games">North Star Games</a> continues to progress its flagship hobbyist title, unfurling new tricks and peculiarities.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 11, 2025 5:32 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Nature is both an entirely new game system and an iteration. It successfully blends a solid core framework with a long line of additional content players can add to tweak and adjust the experience. There is a tremendous amount of potential here, and much of it has already been realized.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nature-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Cinematic Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While the game primarily focuses on a new planet and cast of characters, the trailer does highlight a few staple characters of the Borderlands series, including the iconic bartender Mad Moxxi and the annoying robot known as Claptrap. The gameplay features new traversal mechanics like double jumping, gliding, dodging, and fixed-point grappling, and there are plenty of new guns to loot. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/">Borderlands 4 will support Shift codes</a>, and here are all known codes and how to redeem them.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 releases on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version launches October 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/">Borderlands 4 review</a> calls the starting lineup of Vault Hunters the best yet, but describes the "repetitive" enemy designs and "dull" side quests as weak points of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><em>Game Informer </em>spoke with Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann last year on the set of <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2. Since then, he's revealed he is stepping back from Season 3 of the show to focus on developing the studio's next game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement">revealed at The Game Awards 2024</a> last December.&nbsp;</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a><em>, </em>Druckmann discussed a number of things about Intergalactic, including casting Tati Gabrielle as the game's lead, Jordan A. Mun, working with Joel actor Troy Baker again, casting <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2 actor Tony Dalton (who played Joel's dad), and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the most revealing statement from Druckmann came when <em>Variety </em>asked him about his description of Intergalactic as having "the deepest gameplay" in Naughty Dog history.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can look at our previous titles and see the evolution going from 'Uncharted,' where we're really cutting our teeth on a realistic character-action game, third-person shooter, combined with emotional storytelling," Druckmann said. "With 'The Last of Us,' we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts. Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi, and you start to get the sense of what we're doing, and then we've gotten even more ambitious than that."</p><p>My money's on a deep, third-person, character-driven RPG with multiple open hubs to explore, and I hope I'm right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about Gabrielle's casting, Druckmann explains Naughty Dog had an idea of who protagonist Jordan is as a character, but via documents and backstories – scripts and gameplay come much later as the team wants the space to "run experiments and prototypes and then see what works, what doesn't work," and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were kind of at that stage when we started talking to [Gabrielle]," Druckmann told <em>Variety</em>. "That came about because we had just cast her in Season 2 [of <em>The Last of Us</em>], and just got the idea that she might be perfect for this role. Then she showed up, she came by Naughty Dog, I pitched her the story as it was at the time, and we kind of walked through it beginning, middle, end, and explained what her role would be.</p><p>"I asked her if she'd be willing to audition, and she was. We had her on stage, and I asked Troy to come in and read with her, so she read against Troy Baker. We were just very confident that is our Jordan A. Mun."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Druckmann says since then, he's been writing with Gabriella, something he did with Ellie actor Ashley Johnson and Baker when making The Last of Us. "[Gabrielle's] been just as influential in the writing and the thinking of this character, her arc, and I believe she's gonna be very iconic and complex and interesting in the Naughty Dog tradition.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Baker, Druckmann says, "Troy is in the game, and it's been five years since I've worked with Troy, and I've got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on stage with him again."</p>

<p>The final piece of casting information from this interview is about Dalton. Druckmann says after working with him on Episode 206 of <em>The Last of Us </em>where he played Joel's dad, he DM'd him on Instagram to ask if he'd jump into a Zoom call to check out Intergalactic. "We jumped on a Zoom call, and I showed him parts of the game, and I talked to him about it," Druckmann said. "He's like, 'Yeah, I'm in. I'd love to do it.' So Tony Dalton is there, and maybe there's a few more [of actors from Season 1 or Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>]."</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is due out on PlayStation 5, though there's no word on when to expect the game.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the"><em>Game Informer's </em>interview with Druckmann about creating Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>]</p><hr><p><em>When do you think Intergalactic will launch?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/signal-rolls-out-secure-backups-just-after-i-had-to-nuke-my-message-history.1295196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a month my phone was, from a technical perspective, “severely messed up.” I am a klutz on occasion, which is partially why I’ve gotten good at backing up my data, buying the most durable tools possible, and repairing the things that I own. But this time my phone was not only beyond the limits of my repair abilities, but also of everybody I brought the device to, and it contained the only thing I could not back up: my (iOS) Signal history. So, with a heavy heart, I had to let those chats go. So when Signal finally confirmed that they were rolling out “secure backups” in a limited capacity, I was ecstatic, and the timing made me want to throw a brick at a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve never used Signal before, you should. It’s as secure a messaging app as you’re likely to get, works across most platforms, and is just generally well-encrypted and secure. It’s flexible and can work between your desktop and phone. But because it’s a piece of software that prioritizes security over retention, it has historically been complicated to back your conversations up.</p><p>This is by design: though your messages sync across devices, you cannot currently back them up to the cloud. iOS devices like the iPhone are especially annoying as you can only directly transfer it to another iOS device, usually over wifi. (Android phones can work similarly with the option <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages#android_restore_steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for local backups</a>, and people have <a href="https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built complex, open source tools</a> for this purpose.) I have had to transfer my Signal history over multiple iPhones in the past, and thankfully the old devices were screwed up in a way that was either repairable or did not compromise the integrity of the phone itself.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, however, I was not so lucky. Following a freak accident, my phone got messed up in the most specific and annoying way possible: damage to the logic board, most likely the NAND flash. The phone would boot up momentarily, work very poorly for about 30 seconds (and a few times up to 30 minutes), and then promptly reboot. The phone was simply unable to stay on long enough to back up my conversations.</p><p>For about 99% of what’s on my phone, it’s not catastrophic. I’m fairly regular at backing up my photos and messages, so while the cost of a new or refurbished phone is bad, it’s mostly not world ending. But I did not want to lose my Signal chat, particularly years of discussions with my one other friend who is just as obsessed with technology as I am, in the way that I am. Both of us are very good at taking notes, but occasionally it would be useful to search the transcript for something one of us linked to in an offhanded way.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in my desperation, I spent multiple weeks seeing if a guy could fix the issue. I brought it to a guy who said he fixed it, but didn't, then that guy had to send it to <em>another guy </em>in Sunset Park, who held on to it for a week, said he fixed it, only for it to not be fixed. What’s more, I had already planned a vacation to the Bay Area with my girlfriend and I could not get a new device in time, so I had to navigate the entire trip via the 30 seconds of time my phone could handle, on my girlfriend’s phone, and over café WiFi on an iPad Mini. I cannot stress how embarrassing it is to walk around holding an iPad Mini like a man-sized toddler, although I guess if you have to pull something like that, San Francisco is the place to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>By choosing to use Signal on iOS, I had authored the inevitable demise of my texts. Eventually I just got a replacement phone and wiped the old one, those messages wiped away like a sand mandala being dumped into the ocean. I had to live my life. Perhaps this was for the best.</p><p><strong>Finally, Secure Backups</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/introducing-secure-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a blog post Monday</a>, Signal announced that they were finally rolling out a beta on Android (with iOS to follow) that allows for secure backups in the cloud. Based on the writeup as well as what’s covered in the support <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-signal-backups-testing/69984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>, there’s a lot to like and a lot to prod at. The feature is opt-in by default, and covers up all your texts and up to 45 days of media. If you want to store all of your media, Signal offers a monthly paid service (their first, they are a non-profit) of $1.99 to cover the cost of 100GBs of media storage. Media itself is encrypted twice and padded to obscure the file size.&nbsp;</p><p>The backup is end-to-end encrypted and locked with a 64-character recovery key. Though another person at the other end of a conversation can back up your conversation without you enabling the feature, disappearing and deleted messages are removed from any archive the way they were intended to. It also introduces a backup format that is readable independently of all clients, which opens up the possibility of theoretically restoring your messages between iOS, Android, and Desktop clients.</p><p>As with most security features, the devil is in the details. But security has always been Signal’s highest priority, which is why something as basic and heavily requested as secure backups took so long to figure out. And if there’s a potential exploit, Signal’s user base will probably be the first to figure it out. Though I’m bummed out, this was always something I’d known could happen, and I know this feature would not have rolled out to iOS fast enough to save my conversations. I’m done grieving my Signal history and am tranquil in the knowledge that I can finally shoot my phone with a shotgun without worrying that my secure texts and conversations from close friends will be lost forever.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/invert-controls-horizontal-x-axis"><h3>OK, But Who Is Inverting Their Horizontal Controls?</h3></a><p>The answer may go back to devotees of older, Japanese-made video games</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-could-be-super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-universal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-next-super-mario-bros-movie-could-be-called-%E2%80%9Csuper-mario-galaxy%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-rumor.1295181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-legend-of-zelda-live-action-link-and-zelda-casting/">Legend of Zelda movie premiering in 2027</a>, we know that Nintendo is working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">follow-up</a> to its Super Mario Bros. film in 2023. Now, a day before what has been confirmed to be the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-confirms-this-weeks-general-direct-is-its-longest-ever/">longest general Nintendo Direct ever</a>, a new leak might've just revealed the title of the next film to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">Reddit</a>, NBC Universal has registered domains as of yesterday, September 10, 2025, which point to Super Mario Galaxy being the title. Both of the domains registered, when entered into your browser, <a href="http://supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com/">redirect to Universal's official website</a>. </p>



<p>That said, this does not necessarily mean the title is locked in, but the timing of the registrations do add some weight to Super Mario Galaxy potentially being the title for the coming Super Mario Bros. sequel. There's also the issue of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">a press release from this past May from NBC Universal</a> that seemed to let the title slip, though in that case, the supposed title was "<em>Super Mario World</em>."</p>



<p>In a way, when looking at the post-credits scene from the first Super Mario Bros. movie, which teased the arrival of Yoshi, Super Mario World does seem to make more sense. Though it's not like Yoshi is absent from the Galaxy games, meaning the door is still open for it to be Super Mario Galaxy.</p>



<p>With the original Super Mario Bros. game about to celebrate its 40th anniversary this coming Saturday, September 13, 2025, and the next Super Mario Bros. film currently set to arrive on April 3, 2026, the timing does line up that we'd hear about the film's title <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct</a>, and potentially even some news around what the film will entail, possibly even a teaser trailer.</p>



<p>Regardless, we will hopefully know which leak is correct by tomorrow. If it's Super Mario World, then these domains are potentially for something else entirely. If it's Super Mario Galaxy, then who knows what NBC Universal was referring to when the phrase was included and then removed from a press release in May. We'll see what answers tomorrow does, or doesn't, bring.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-makes-11-fantastic-changes-and-3-that-ain%E2%80%99t-great.1295172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Gearbox’s open-world looter-shooter sequel is a big game with a lot of quests to complete and plenty of endgame content to check out. As such, my review isn’t ready yet. But I’ve played nearly 40 hours so far, and I’ve enjoyed my time. A big reason why is that Gearbox has made some smart changes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that make it easier than ever to manage, sell, and collect loot and get around the world.</p> <p>As a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan who has played all of the games multiple times, I have cataloged a list of changes and improvements in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that I think both longtime fans and newcomers alike are going to be excited about.</p> <h2>Finally, A Weapon Wheel</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For many, many years now, <em>Borderlands</em> fans, myself included, have longed for the franchise to add a real weapon wheel option. Past games have sometimes allowed you to use the d-pad on a controller to hot-swap between four guns, which is fine, I guess. But a true weapon wheel hasn’t been an option until now. <em>Borderlands 4</em> finally adds a real, honest-to-goodness weapon wheel, and it’s so nice. It makes quickly swapping to a gun easier and faster than ever!</p>

 <h2>Mark Loot As Junk When Picking Up</h2> <p>In <em>Borderlands 4</em>, like in past games, you’ll spend a lot of time collecting guns that are bad, or just not what you want. In the past, you’d have to manually sell each of these. And yes, you could mark them as loot in the inventory screen and then sell them all at once. But now, in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em>,</a> you can junk loot as you pick it up. This ties into another great change…</p> <h2>Instantly Sell Junk At Vending Machines</h2> <p>All that loot you mark as junk can now be sold at any vending machine just by walking up and hitting a single button. You don’t even have to go into the store screen. It’s so nice, and this change, as well as the last one, has helped keep my inventory mostly empty and ready for more loot.</p>

 <h2>The Lost Loot Menu Is So Much Better</h2> <p>Speaking of loot, in some past <em>Borderlands</em> games, players were able to return to a hub area and activate a “Lost Loot” machine that would spit out some of the guns that dropped out in the world that the player didn’t pick up. This wasn’t a very efficient way to handle the process and made using the Lost Loot option annoying. In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> this is now handled through a menu screen that lets you easily trash stuff you don’t want and take stuff you do want.&nbsp; And you can hit a button to take it all without having to grab each item off the floor.</p> <h2>A Warning When Selling Equipped Gear And Guns</h2> <p>Sometimes, when dealing with lots of loot and similar guns, it’s easy to mark an equipped piece of loot as junk and sell it. This has happened to me in past games. Sure, you could favorite stuff you didn’t want to sell, which is still an option in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> but it was always weird how the games just let you sell equipped gear so easily. Not so in <em>Borderlands 4</em>! Now you get a pop-up warning when trying to sell equipped items marked as junk. Nifty!</p>

 <h2>Legendary Weapons Are Much Rarer To Find, And That’s Good</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624985">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the biggest problems I had with <em>Borderlands 3</em> was how easily and quickly you found legendary weapons and gear. On a recent playthrough, I was collecting and selling them within a few hours of starting a new character. By the end of the game, I had found well over 100. I lost count, really. This made them feel less special and made non-legendary purple gear less exciting to collect because better stuff was dropping all the time.</p> <p>Thankfully, this isn’t the case in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> After nearly 40 hours with the game, I’ve only collected 7 legendary weapons and items. And one of those I bought from a vending machine, something I’ve only seen once in my time with the game.&nbsp; Unlike in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, when legendaries drop in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> I get genuinely excited! It’s a rare event, and many of the items have been powerful and memorable.</p>

 <h2>Customize Your Character Anywhere And Anytime</h2> <p>In the past, if you wanted to put a new skin or hat on your <em>Borderlands</em> character, you’d have to find a specific machine in-game and use it. This was annoying. Now, you can just open up the customization menu whenever you want and freely change your character’s looks.</p> <h2>Upgrading Your Inventory And Ammo Capacity Isn’t A Boring Money Grind</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s big open world has a lot of places to explore, things to do, items to collect, and activities to complete. And this time around, Gearbox has decided to tie the open world to upgrading your character. Instead of grinding for money and then going to an in-game store to buy SDU upgrades, which let you carry more stuff and ammo, you now earn SDU credits by exploring and completing activities. And this is all done via a menu that is available at all times. Need more loot space to collect more guns? Well, check to see if you have enough SDU credits to upgrade your inventory space, and if so, do it right then and there. So convenient!</p>

 <h2>An Optional Hologram Path That Helps You Go The Right Way</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent far too much time in past <em>Borderlands</em> games running around trying to figure out how to get to a specific place or a quest marker. The in-game maps have been helpful, but sometimes you just want someone to draw a line from where you are now to where you need to go. And good news: <em>Borderlands 4</em> does that now! At any point, you can hit a button to get an in-game holographic path showing how to reach your destination, which can be a quest or just a random point you marked on the map.</p> <h2>Repkits Offer Healing When You Need It Most</h2> <p>A new piece of loot introduced in<em> Borderlands 4</em> are repkits. These are small medical devices that players can activate every so often for some instant healing. No more hunting down health drops during tricky boss fights or big skirmishes. Those tiny bits of healing still drop and are still useful, but having a health gun at your side is great. And as with all loot in <em>Borderlands</em>, repkits come in various flavors with all sorts of weird, wacky, and useful bonuses and passive traits. Honestly, going back to any past <em>Borderlands</em> game is going to be hard after getting used to repkits.</p>

 <h2>Spawn Your Vehicle Whenever You Need It</h2> <p>A big theme when it comes to the changes and improvements made in <em>Borderlands 4</em> is convenience. And perhaps the best example of this is the removal of Catch-A-Ride stations, which previously were the only way to spawn in a vehicle. Now, every player has their own personal Digirunner (which are basically Sparrows from <em>Destiny</em>),&nbsp;and they are awesome. They move quickly, feel great to drive, and being able to call one in whenever you want is so handy. Plus, combining Digirunners with the new movement controls, like double jumping and gliding, lets you speed across the world in style.</p> <p><em><strong>And now, some changes that aren’t so good…</strong></em></p> <h2>Menus Feel Dark, Finicky, And Removed From The Game World</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624987">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Something I really loved about the menus in past <em>Borderlands</em> games was how vibrant they all were and how they existed in the world. When you opened your inventory or skills menu in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, you’d see your character standing in the world, and the menu would be hovering next to and behind them. That’s gone in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Instead, all the menus and inventory screens exist in dark voids that feel disconnected from the world. And some of these menus are tricky to use or feel overly cluttered. The inventory, in particular, isn’t great to navigate when using a controller. This change doesn’t ruin <em>Borderlands 4</em>, but it does make me sad.</p>

 <h2>Loading Screens Are Dull</h2> <p>This is a silly complaint, I’ll admit, but the loading screens in <em>Borderlands 4 a</em>re so boring. In past games, which were filled with loading screens, you’d get these wonderful, colorful posters of the location you were loading into at that moment. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> which has far fewer loading screens thanks to its (mostly) seamless open world, the screens just look like someone took concept art and tossed the location’s name on it. They seem stale, cold, and drab. Thankfully, stuff loads so quickly that you won’t have to look at them long.</p> <h2>Rewards For Challenges And Quests Are Hidden In Digital Boxes</h2> <p>When you complete a quest in <em>Borderlands 4</em> or when you finish an in-game challenge, you are rewarded with various goodies. But these goodies aren’t delivered directly to your inventory. Instead, you have to go into the character menu and open them up. Thankfully, you can open them all at once, but it’s so odd that this system is even in the game.</p> <p>Sure, it’s nice that guns or loot you earn from a quest aren’t dropped right in your limited inventory. But it’s annoying that cosmetic items are also locked in these chests. The game also does a terrible job of reminding you to check on your rewards. Sometimes I’d open my character screen and see, like, 10 of these chests waiting for me. I’d love an option to get notified every so often when I have more than two or three of these things waiting around to be opened.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-hbo-2000624967</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-director-teases-naughty-dog%E2%80%99s-most-expensive-game-ever.1295166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been almost a year since <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">was teased at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Naughty Dog’s upcoming sci-fi adventure doesn’t have a release window yet, much less a trailer showing what players will spend most of the blockbuster doing. But director Neil Druckmann did confirm it will&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>be the studio’s most expensive game to date and reflect its growing ambition when it comes to delivering more expansive gameplay. Maybe that’s why had to ditch working on <em>The Last of Us</em> season 3 for HBO alongside his duties at PlayStation.</p> <p>“What can I say and not say?” the veteran developer said, tip-toeing around spoilers and PR guidelines <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">in a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>. “I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it. We’re firing on all cylinders.” Set in a far-flung, alternate future, <em>Heretic Prophet</em> follows bounty hunter Jordan A. Mun (Tati Gabrielle) who begins unraveling the secrets of a remote planet after becoming stranded there during a mission.</p> <p>“I’ve said this before, but I really mean it, I’m really feeling it right now: It’s the most ambitious game we’ve ever made. It’s the most expansive game we’ve ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it. Troy [Baker] is in the game, and it’s been five years since I’ve worked with Troy, and I’ve got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on the stage with him again.”</p>

 <p>While he hedged on the upcoming PS5 exclusive’s budget, it doesn’t seem like a shocker that it will end up costing more than the last new game Naughty Dog shipped, 2019’s <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. In addition to the rising costs of development on current-gen platforms, a new IP like <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> will come with a hefty marketing price-tag as Sony tries to sell fans on the next big thing from the studio behind <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Jak and Daxter</em>, and <em>Uncharted</em>.</p> <p>Druckmann did give a slight tease in the interview of what we can expect from <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> in terms of scope. “With <em>The Last of Us</em>, we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts,” he said. “Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi and you start to get the sense of what we’re doing, and then we’ve gotten even more ambitious than that. So really looking forward to see how it all comes together. I think you’re all going to be pleasantly surprised by it.”</p>

 <p>While pressing up against the ceiling of vagueness, the comment seems to reaffirm that <em>Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> will showcase even more player freedom and agency within its world. Druckmann also confirmed actor Tony Dalton, who appears in the<em> Last of Us</em> TV show (he played Joel’s dad in a season two flashback), will appear in the game too, potentially alongside others from the HBO series (the show is up for three Emmys at this year’s awards ceremony on Sunday).</p> <p>As for what comes after <em>Heretic Prophet</em>, Druckmann is still being cryptic about Naughty Dog’s future and what other projects it has in the works. There was talk of doing <em>The Last of Us Part III</em> after the last game but the team wanted to try something sci-fi instead. “I’m sure if <em>Intergalactic</em> is successful, you will see it again,” he told<em> Variety</em>. “Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can’t say, and I leave that door open. Not to be coy for this particular question, we want to see how we feel once we’re done with it and look at the options in front of us, because we have some other ideas that we’d like to explore as well.”</p>

                <p>The TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us on HBO is a big hit, but could the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, leap to TV or the big screen?</p><p>It's too soon say, but Hollywood studios are already pitching Naughty Dog, Neil Druckmann said. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Druckmann said, "We've already had studios approach us" about Intergalactic--based on excitement around the trailer alone. "Just having seen the trailer; they don't know much about the game," Druckmann said of these pitches from unspecified companies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Given the success of The Last of Us TV series at HBO, it makes sense that studios would come knocking and try to lock up an adaptation of Naughty Dog's next project. For his part, Druckmann said, "I want to make sure we don't put the cart in front of the horse." He said Naughty Dog needs to ensure Intergalactic turns into a "fantastic video game" before any transmedia opportunities are considered.</p><p>Also, it would have to be the "right partnership," he said. If those conditions can be set, Druckmann said it "would be great" to see Intergalactic find a new audience for TV or film.</p><p>"There's a lot of ideas of what we could do with Intergalactic, and in some ways it’s easier to expand that because it's just how that story is structured in that universe," he said. "So there's some interesting conversations happening about potential projects that could come down in the future, but our priority right now is to make Intergalactic the next big, fantastic Naughty Dog game."</p><p>As for the game Intergalactic, Druckmann said, "We're in the thick of it. We're making it, we're playing it. We're firing on all cylinders."</p><p>"It's the most ambitious game we've ever made. It's the most expansive game we've ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it," Druckmann said.</p><p>HBO's The Last of Us series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-release-date-trailer-cast-story/1100-6534454/" data-ref-id="1100-6534454">returns in 2027 for its third and potentially final season.</a> Season 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-another-emmy-this-time-for-its-most-traumatic-episode/1100-6534544/#:~:text=HBO's%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us,Its%20Most%20Traumatic%20Episode%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6534544">just won a Creative Arts Emmy award</a>, and the show is nominated for many more in the upcoming main Emmy awards show on September 14.</p>
