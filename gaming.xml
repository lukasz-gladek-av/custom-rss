            <p>An uncut eight-minute video of Astro Bot has popped up online.</p>
<p>The footage – recorded at ChinaJoy2024 – shows off the game's combat and platforming premise, as well as a delightful boss battle with an octopus in scuba gear (nope, I don't understand, either) and boxing gloves.</p>
<p>You can see the action for yourself in the video below:</p>

<p>Astro Bot is set to release exclusively on PS5 on 6th September, 2024.</p>
<p>"It feels bold to say so early on, but if the demo's quality is representative of the full game, Astro Bot looks like a strong candidate for the top spot on my own game of the year list," Digital Foundry's John <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hands-on-with-astro-bot-creative-beautiful-and-authentically-playstation">wrote</a> after a little hands-on time with it last month.</p>
<p>"Astro's Playroom certainly shows a similar level of polish and fun game design, so I'm optimistic that the full release will be equally good if not even better.</p>
<p>In fact, if Team Asobi can execute on the vision the demo provides, this might be one of the best 3D platforming games ever made. There's a huge amount here that's unexpected, imaginative and absolutely joyous, and I can't wait to play the full release.</p>

I’m <em>this</em> close to absolutely adoring this assortment of timed challenges from NES games.

            <p>
Just up the road from Newport, in the countryside off the M40, a troupe of actors and backstage boffins are gearing up for a fresh season of strangeness. 
</p>
<p>
Key of Dreams is billed as a unique blend of interactive theatre, puzzle solving and branching narrative spread over 24 hours in Treowen, a historic 17th century Welsh manor house you've likely seen on Doctor Who. Within its walls, Key of Dreams mixes the location's real-world history with weird fiction tales inspired by the likes of MR James and HP Lovecraft, in an experience that allows guests to decide the fates of its various characters and guide how its intertwining storylines evolve.
</p>
<p>
Unlike other interactive theatre performances, such as those from the acclaimed Punchdrunk, Key of Dreams is designed to be a more influenceable experience, with less of an emphasis on following tightly scripted narrative in favour of something more open world. Launched last year to positive reviews and an endorsement from Neil Patrick Harris, a handful of guests have already made repeat trips, taking advantage of the fact Key of Dreams' storylines are swapped in and out to keep its mysteries fresh, with an array of endings so no two visits are quite the same. 
</p>
<p>
It all sounds ambitious, even for creators well-versed in the complexities of branching narratives, and yet its production company Lemon Difficult is still in its infancy. Five years ago, its founder and creative director Ivan Caric worked as a consultant for a telecoms company - until everything changed suddenly when his father died during Covid. 
</p>
<p>
"I had a reassessment, I guess is a gentle way of putting it," Caric tells me. "I had a bit of a breakdown." 
</p>
<p>
It was a moment to take stock, Caric says, and make a leap of faith to work on something closer to his personal interests: role-playing games, immersive theatre and - when he was a bit younger - running around playing LARP. 
</p>
<p>
"I've done role-playing games, I love video games and I love immersive theatre," he says, chatting with me via video call. "I wanted to create something that was an intersection of all of those, that took bits from each and yet was enjoyable for anyone not just into immersive theatre but also escape rooms, gaming, puzzles. 
</p>
<p>
"Lots of immersive theatre doesn't get what makes a good game," he continues, "and that's not necessarily a bad thing, they're just trying to achieve something different. Whereas I'm interested in the mechanics, and how they make people feel."
</p>

<p>
Key of Dreams has three main narrative pillars, each designed to appeal to various groups of visitors. Before each 24-hour session begins, players are invited to join one of several secret societies, which helps mix people together (though you can say no and join another with a friend if you so choose). Each group has its own goal, linking to the wider weird fiction mythos. Then there are the experience's NPCs, its cast of four actors who live in-role throughout, with their own personalities and backstories to discover, and goals you can help or hinder. Finally, there are stories involving puzzles within the house itself (which for Christmas this year will feature Dickensian festive horror tales, Caric tells me). 
</p>
<p>
"It's a collaborative and a competitive experience, because there are these groups which are in competition against each other," Caric says. "But because there's this investigative vibe - there's boards, red string - it does encourage cooperation." 
</p>
<p>
One of the key considerations for Lemon Difficult when engineering the experience was to make it something all guests - up to 30 at a time - can feel included within, rather than one where specific individuals end up being able to steer its outcome. Likewise, it is designed so that any guest who turns up determined not to engage won't spoil it for the rest. Typically, however, this isn't a problem.
</p>
<p>
"There's a guy called Matthew Pennington who runs the UK's biggest LARP," Caric says. "His background is database admin - and he treats his LARP as software that he runs on people. You're trying to encourage certain behaviours, rather than have concrete rules which say you can do this, you cannot do that. Obviously there are rules, there are certain things you're not allowed to do, but you can nudge people into certain behaviours that can result in the effect and in the world that you want. That's what we've tried to do."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously people are people, they're not software," Key of Dreams' lead writer Laura Langrish adds. "But by building the sense of tension, the weirdness, by changing the soundscapes, the light, it changes how they're feeling." People entering the experience quickly become caught up, she continues.
</p>
<p>
"If you take someone and tell them a weird story and say at the end they have to do a ritual, it's going to feel awkward," she says. "It just will. But when you've spent a whole day in the house with these objects, talking to people, when someone says 'you know what you have to do to end this story, it's your choice to do it', well..." 
</p>
<p>
Key of Dreams kicks off in the afternoon, when - like any good horror - things begin normally enough. But then stuff starts to get weird - "and then after that things go a bit batshit," Langrish teases. "There's kind of an informal tutorial to how the mechanics of it work, the people, and then you're off exploring the story, doing rituals, making terrible decisions," she says. "And by that point it's dark, you've got a lantern, and there's a conspiratorial element to it." The action continues through the evening - even during mealtimes, which include a seven-course banquet - before events are resolved after breakfast the following day. 
</p>
<p>
"The cost is the giant elephant in the room," Caric notes. Key of Dreams is not cheap. It's pitched as a luxury overnight immersive experience and priced accordingly, at £400 for a ticket, not including accommodation. Caric justifies the "value proposition" as being fair for a 24-hour experience with a high actor-to-guest ratio, four meals including the banquet, and the cost of the venue. Still, he accepts it is out of reach for many - and hopes to run a more affordable version in London next year.

<p>
"It's physically very demanding," Caric says of the actors involved. "They're basically there and in role for 12 to 14 hours, even when people aren't watching. And they have to react to how people behave. But because you have all this time to get to know them, you can befriend them, find out what they like and dislike. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not like a dating sim, though," Caric quickly adds. "You can't just discover they like this obscure thing, find that and suddenly they're your best friend. You build a relationship with them, because they're meant to be real people."
</p>
<p>
Lemon Difficult has worked with many of the same actors for a few years - including one person involved in the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie. But the cast come from a variety of professional backgrounds, including another actor involved in re-enactment at stately homes, who supervises a puzzle where you smelt down lead.
</p>
<p>
"You can't really recruit for 'look, we're going to live in the same house for three weeks, how do we not kill each other?'" Caric says. "We've ended up with something of an extended family." This also helps with what Caric describes as "a tight budget", where the team work together to create their own props, or rely on the help of friends - such as a pal of Caric's who works as a software designer, who programmed the Raspberry Pi-based tech that connects to radios throughout the house.
</p>
<p>
Someone from Lemon Difficult's creative team, such as Caric or Langrish, is always on-site, overseeing how events progress while in character as a sinister lawyer ("think Wolfram &amp; Hart", Caric says). But in building the experience, the intent was that its actors get plenty of latitude to react organically along the way. "Being backstage is like being a GM who has lost control of the game," Langrish muses. "At any point there are 20-something players running around, you don't know where they are or what they know, and you've just got to trust the NPCs are doing their job."
</p>
<p>
So how do you write a story - or multiple intertwining stories - for a group of players with the freedom to uncover them all at their own pace? "Branching narrative is an understatement for what we do, but in some ways it's more complicated and in some ways it's less," Langrish says. "Ours is a lot more open world. It's a case of writing for the actors so they know how to react in lots of different scenarios: what they know about a scenario, how they should react, and how they should react to ensure guests have a good experience. In a video game, if you fail or die you just restart. Whereas we don't kill the guests."
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lemon Difficult</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unravelling Key of Dreams' mysteries involves exploring Treowen's house and grounds, in a manner Langrish compares to that of Gone Home. "You're exploring a house through the objects within it, to learn about the people who were there but now aren't," she hints. These stories are created from a mix of weird fiction tales (one is a mash-up of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by HP Lovecraft and The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, where you'll discover what went on through pieces of writing, pieces of wallpaper, and potion bottles), but also real history - which guests can continue looking into once they get home.  
</p>
<p>
The ability for guests to share knowledge and pool resources heightens the experience, Caric says, beyond what you might experience in a single-player story game. "Guest collaboration is really important, and it's our job and the actor's job to point people to others who may be investigating the same thing. It's all opt-in, and there are many ways to go about it - you can research, you can ask characters, and these all point to the same place."
</p>
<p>
"You can do all the legwork and feel very clever," Langrish says. "You can also just sit in the bar with a cocktail and get the same information spending four hours opening really fiendish puzzle boxes and get it as a narrative hidden in there. We had a couple who came along and solved things in those two different ways."
</p>
<p>
Investigative work and puzzles make up a core part of the experience, but Lemon Difficult is keen to ensure things never feel, well, too difficult. "Obviously there are things to collect, physical things to put together, paths to follow, there are those mechanics, but we really spend a lot of time thinking about how things will make people feel," Caric notes. "We don't want people to feel like they've lost. We want people to feel bewildered but not for too long.
</p>
<p>
"I'm playing Talos Principle 2 at the moment and there's a rush when you solve a puzzle after being slightly frustrated. Sometimes you need that frustration - but you don't want it to go on too long." It's here the experience's actors can help - or be persuaded to help - in character. "I love escape rooms, but I hate asking for clues as it makes me feel stupid," Caric continues, laughing. "Whereas we can see how people are getting on, and very gently nudge them towards clues in a way that feels seamless."
</p>
<p>
"Now we've done it, I'm confident in saying it's brilliant," Langrish says. "Before that, though, it was a terrifying thing. There is so much written for this show." Each of the actors have a 40-page document that acts as part script, part character history, as well as a spreadsheet that tracks how events can unfold. "Each of the five main story threads and each of the four characters all have different ways in which they can end," she explains.  "And how those nine different things end in the night then changes how the morning happens."
</p>
<p>
My time speaking to Caric and Langrish wraps up with them sharing more of the backstage work built into the experience, and the planning that happens before guests wake up the next day. But like Key of Dreams' many secrets, the machinery behind it all is best left unspoiled. This sounds like one to discover yourself.

                <p>Adamantium is coming to the MCU thanks to Captain America: Brave New World from an unlikely source--The Eternals. If you've ever been a Marvel comics fan, you know why this is big news. The fictional metal Vibranium has been a central element of the MCU since Captain America's shield first appeared, but that's because Marvel's most famous metal belonged to a character they couldn't use at the time.</p><p>As part of Marvel Studios' big San Diego Comic-Con panel, the studio is talking about the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World. Among the many details shared in the panel and trailer, this one stood out: Adamantium is coming to the MCU.</p><p>In Marvel comic books, Adamantium is the king of sci-fi metals. Captain America's shield is crafted from the material in the books, as is the body of Ultron (the primary antagonist of Avengers: Age of Ultron). But Adamantium is best know as the material coating the skeleton of Marvel's best-known and most profitable mutant, Wolverine.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this introduction is the source. Adamantium is being found for the first time in the solidified form of the Celestial that rose from the Earth in the South Pacific in the 2021 film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">The Eternals</a>. This is one of, if not <em>the</em> first mention of the Celestial since the movie released, aside from Easter eggs like the mention of "a giant statue of a man sticking out of the ocean" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-episode-2-9-easter-eggs-and-references-you-missed/2900-4284/" data-ref-id="2900-4284">in She-Hulk</a>.</p><p>For years, the X-Men and all mutants--including Wolverine--belonged to 20th Century Fox. With Disney's acquisition a few years back, the X-Men were back in the hands of Marvel proper, leading to Wolverine's debut in the just-released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine film</a>.</p><p>It would be easy to assume, then, that Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is the introduction of adamantium into the MCU. But Deadpool &amp; Wolverine isn't quite the same as a mainline MCU film. It acts as a sort of bridge between the Fox and Marvel Studios films, and takes place on Earths other than Earth-616 (Marvel's primary canonical Earth). The Wolverine in that movie also won't be the one introduced to the MCU. Thus, this acts as the official introduction of the metal into the main MCU--setting the stage for the day that Marvel Studios recasts the grumpiest X-Man and lets him go 'snikt' for the first time with his iconic claws.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-breakdown-and-easter-eggs/2900-5589/" data-ref-id="2900-5589">Captain America: Brave New World</a> stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Captain America, and introduce both Giancarlo Esposito as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/giancarlo-esposito-confirmed-as-leader-of-the-serpent-society-for-captain-america-4/1100-6525357/" data-ref-id="1100-6525357">leader of the Serpent Society</a> and Harrison Ford as Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. hits theaters on February 14, 2025, so take your beloved to go see Harrison Ford maybe turn into the Red Hulk.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><em>Editor's Note: Alongside the release of </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-4/Lovestruck_Guide"><u><em>The Sims 4’s Lovestruck Expansion Pack</em></u></a><em>, we are taking a fresh look at the base game in 2024, replacing our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/the-sims-4-review"><em>original review from 2014</em></a><em>. You can read more about </em><a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>our review policies and philosophy here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>In 2014, while wearing a cardboard plumbob headband I’d hastily made the night before, I lined up at a local game store to pick up my pre-ordered copy of The Sims 4. With a create-a-sim wardrobe full of Pinterest-friendly fashion items and a host of then-modern appliances, The Sims 4 felt like a cutting-edge sequel at launch, one that reflected those simpler times. But what’s even more impressive is that now, almost a decade of updates later, it’s <em>still </em>the benchmark life simulator, offering a profoundly unique household sandbox that’s yet to find stable competition. Its aging sense of style and sometimes archaic systems do mean The Sims 4 cannot coast on this legacy forever, even with an admirable free-to-play pivot back in 2022. But with a collaborative network of community tools and a world of chaos at your fingertips, The Sims 4 maintains itself as an Imagineer’s dream nonetheless. </p><p>As Dr. Frankenstein so famously found out, recreating life is full of complications, and The Sims 4 leans heavily into the mad scientist fantasy of it all. It provides you with all the tools you need to build a bespoke world full of customized people who have hopes, dreams, and occasionally questionable haircuts. By distilling the human experience into a pool of malleable metrics, you get the opportunity to play god with families of those virtual avatars, guiding them as they travel the peaks and valleys of life, from birth to death and everything in between. While The Sims 4 certainly could have taken the punishing route of finicky and overcomplicated systems, it instead carefully balances the complexities of human life in a surprisingly approachable manner.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Sims 4 Gameplay Screenshots (2024)</h3></div></output><p>Beyond staying on top of their immediate biological needs, like toilet breaks, sleep, and hunger, there are aspirations and fears to contend with, as well as bills to pay, careers to nurture, and social lives to spin. Your omnipotence gives you the unfettered freedom to mess with the citizens of your world, and it’s entertaining to haphazardly graft the frenzied whims of your imagination onto the lives of its inhabitants. Whether you wield this power for cruelty or kindness is entirely up to you, and the fact that most of your larger goals are self-driven (like levelling up your music skill enough to become a rockstar, or finding your Sim a loving soulmate) makes it fun to simply play around however the mood strikes you.</p><p>You can choose to use a variety of pre-made families or design a custom household using the Create a Sim toolset. As with humans, Sims are a complex combination of physical presence and personality, and I love that this DIY process allows you to make granular choices that will set each one apart from the crowd. Pairing up personality traits is a minigame in itself and allows for a cast of uncanny characters to take shape in front of you. A hot-headed genius might fly into a rage when they don’t find the time to play a game of chess, whereas a career-driven hopeless romantic could run into difficulties when perfecting their work-life balance. This enticing pick-n-mix process extends into a Sim’s likes and dislikes, with the quirks often playing out in strange and comical ways. A budding virtuoso could be made to cringe at the sound of a guitar, and it’s these small but meaningful interactions that add lifelike depth to these avatars.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll have to buy DLC or rely on mods to find an acceptable fashion sense.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t equal subtlety when developing your Sim’s physical appearance, especially by the standards of contemporary character creators. There’s a decent pool of predesigned facial features to choose from, with a more curated appearance achievable by pushing and pulling at a handful of anchor points to sculpt your Sim’s anatomical features. It’s certainly no Dragon’s Dogma 2, which admittedly isn’t a huge surprise when The Sims 4 first came out just two years after Dragon’s Dogma 1, but it is noticeable in 2024. Even so, I was happy to see that I could at least create a diverse range of body shapes through its sliders and sculpting capabilities. </p><p>Once you’re finished molding their form, your Sim will also need a wardrobe for the many situations life throws at them, from working out to bedtime to fancy dinners. Sadly, most of the clothing options and hairstyles in The Sims 4’s base game now feel ripped from a 2010s fashion magazine rather than any modern catalog. While skinny ties, plaid overshirts, and gauche graphic tees were welcome at launch, there hasn’t been a significant update to the default outfits across The Sims 4’s 10-year lifespan. That issue leaves long-term players stuck between spending cash on costly couture-focused DLC packs or relying on fan-made mods to achieve an acceptable fashion sense. That said, there have been some free additions to Create a Sim that are worth celebrating, such as the introduction of medical wearables like hearing aids and glucose monitors, as well as a choice of customisable pronouns and romantic boundaries for your Sims.</p><p>If you thought people management was The Sims 4’s only draw, think again. As well as a god, you’ll also become a city planner, able to tinker with the architecture of your community across three separate biomes thanks to a comprehensive construction kit called Build Mode. You’ll balance financial costs, health and safety, and style to realize your grand designs, no matter how absurd they may be. A rooftop toilet might be an eyesore for the neighbors, but if you like your restrooms with a view, The Sims 4 isn’t going to stand in your way. </p><p>Not only can you flex your creativity one wall, window, and staircase at a time, but you can also fill your creations with esoteric bric-a-brac like encased scrolls or a collection of creepy gnomes. And if your building skills peak out at hastily crafted mountainside Minecraft homes, the approachable toolset and submenu of ready-made rooms allow you to quickly leave your mark without needing a degree in architectural engineering – though having one certainly would help. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The approachable building tools mean you don't need an architectural degree.</p></div><p>The joy of building isn’t just for personal properties, either, as you’ll also be able to take a stab at commercial real estate. Where cash flow is the antagonizing force when building your Sim’s personal home, public lots instead require minimum furniture and amenities to fulfill their duty. It’s a process that keeps you accountable while gently guiding you away from making useless, lackluster locations. The Sims 4’s sandbox mission statement is always in frame, though, and you can easily ignore the rules and get weird with it anyway. However stifling the Create a Sim can feel at times, it’s made up for by the meticulous tools at your disposal in Build Mode. </p><p>But just because you <em>can </em>build something silly doesn’t mean your Sims will always be happy about it. For instance, while constructing a cheap family home in the desert locale of Oasis Springs, I cut corners on bedroom furniture to save money – a choice that really didn’t gel with the high-standards that were baked into the personality of one of its occupants. That decision led to a rampage of arguments with relatives thanks to their sour mood, spoiling relationships and threatening the fate of the household. Ultimately, I was sent back to the drawing board to clean up the aesthetics to avoid watching my Sim’s social life fall to pieces over mismatched lamps. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is just one example of how The Sims 4’s systems cleverly intermingle with one another, providing an unpredictable sandbox with so many reactive dynamics that delightfully get in the way of your best-laid plans. The ensuing chaos from such cataclysmic social events also acts as an organic jumping-off point for new stories to grow, leading you down scintillating rabbit holes you may not have been expecting. You have enough control to guide your Sims where you generally want them to go, but you won’t always be able to brute force their lives into perfection, and that mitigates the boredom that can come with getting everything you want all at once. (Although there’s nothing wrong with <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-4/PC_Cheats"><u>turning on a few cheats</u></a> and playing without restriction when the mood strikes you, too.)</p><p>Perhaps you want to curate drama on a broader scale than just your household? Well, The Sims 4 has an answer for that, too. A relatively recent addition to the base game is Neighbourhood Stories, which allows you to influence the world by adjusting ambient life changes for the Sims across your map without having to directly play as them. Career changes, accidents, and having children are all aspects of real life, and through this process, the families scattered across your game can continue to thrive (or not) without you. While loosening my grip on every individual element of my Sims’ lives was an uncomfortable shift at first (and one you don’t have to make if it doesn’t suit you), it’s great that this tool allows Sims to flourish around your primary households in a more organic way. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sarah's favourite simulation games</h3></p></div><p>If learning the ropes via happy little accidents doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, another pair of useful post-launch additions are the tips system and scripted scenarios, which can both help smooth over The Sims 4’s sharp edges where necessary. Not only a boon for newer players, these enlightening systems do well to get veteran players like me up to date with the many small-but-impactful changes that have arrived in free updates and paid DLC over the years. There’s a smart balance here that maintains a universal approachability by holding your hand when you want it to and letting go when you’re ready to take a risk. </p><p>Speaking of DLC, 10 years of developer support has left The Sims 4 with a copious amount of themed expansions, with options based around things like seasons, university, magic, and, most recently, dating. This is par for the course for this series, and the quality of these packs is generally top notch – but even with the base game becoming free-to-play, it’s a shame that some paid add-ons now feel like essential parts of the Sims experience. Adding pets to your household or having a more active role in your career come across as fundamental features that should be available to everyone. I get that this has become the business model, but it’s especially frustrating to see intrinsic human experiences like holiday festivities or the ability to create cliques locked behind a paywall. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of The Sims 4’s most prominent assets is its strong community. </p></div><p>To that end, I would be remiss not to mention one of The Sims 4’s most prominent assets: its strong community of players. There is a library’s worth of user-generated lots and characters to take inspiration from or graft into your game, often only a Google search away. Years of community ingenuity have also spawned a manufactured ‘hard mode’ that presents you with hyper-specific tasks to complete if you’re searching for more complex scenarios. These <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nuzlocke</u></a>-esque challenges cater to all kinds of players and can involve anything from building a home with minimal square footage to, my personal favorite, attempting to make your Sim have one hundred babies in their lifetime. </p><p>Another consistent companion across The Sims 4 is its dazzling soundtrack and expressive sound effects, something the series has long been lauded for. Relentlessly optimistic and impressively orchestral, the score’s blend of string, woodwind, and percussive instrumentals offer a comforting backdrop to the building menus and loading screens you’ll spend hours staring at. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Sims 4 is starting to feel its age in 2024, but what keeps it so compelling is that magical feeling that occurs when all its parts work together to create the rich tapestry of your Sims' lives. The complex character creator and approachable building mode are both impressive in their own right – and as personality quirks rub up against the houses you’ve tenderly built, you’re rewarded with hilarious and profound emotional reactions from the beloved families you’re guiding. Romance, friendship, and hatred all play essential roles, and there’s a deeper focus on replicating the complexities of human life than any other game in this genre. Yet despite maintaining the bar for life simulators at large, the last decade has also left the base game with an outdated fashion sense and locked what now feel like core features such as pets behind paid DLC – a problem that can only be escaped by indulging in fan-made mods or costly expansions. Even so, after hundreds of hours of playtime and nearly a decade of history, I’m still always excited to build a new family dynamic and start the chaotic cycle of life all over again.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mafia Definitive Edition is headed to Game Pass next month, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/post-126372864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to insider NateDrake</a>. The game released in September 2020 is a remake of 2002's original installment, which marked the debut of the franchise. The remake was handled by Hangar 13, the same studio that developed Mafia III a couple of years earlier, using that engine. It featured an updated script filled with new dialogue, expanded backstories, and additional cutscenes, not to mention all-new gameplay sequences and features, improved cinematics, and other enhancements. The game was also included as part of the trilogy pack.</p>
<p>Mafia Definitive Edition <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> an eight out of ten score on Wccftech. Here's what Dave Aubrey had to say about the remake:</p>
<p><em>Mafia Definitive Edition is a complete remake of a classic crime game. It looks better than almost any other open-world crime sim you'll see this generation and has a story that'll keep you engaged to the end. It might not be the most revolutionary or innovative title in the genre, but it'll certainly keep you playing. This is an excellent story to play over the course of the weekend, and you're almost certain to be recommending it to your friends once you're done.</em></p>
<p>In other Mafia news, Hangar 13 <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> nearly two years ago that it is making a new installment in the franchise. We haven't heard any further news or rumors about the project, but that may change in the coming months, perhaps even at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As for Game Pass, the subscription service's library would get even richer with this addition, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III earlier this week.</p>
