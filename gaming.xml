			<p>Gaming has had many great periods over its fifty-four years of history (Computer Space, the first commercial game, was developed in 1970 and released the following year), and fans often have hot debates about the best year for new game releases. Today, however, I wanted to place the spotlight on what I consider to be, without a shred of doubt, the best month ever for gaming: November 2004.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, eight seminal games were released in twenty-eight days, breaking people's wallets but also forever marking the spot (and, in some cases, outright changing it) in the history of this entertainment medium. In this article, I'll explain why they were (and in many ways still are) so important while also remembering my feelings about them at the time. The list is strictly ordered based on their respective release dates.</p>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - October 26, 2004</h2>
<p>Rockstar's fifth main entry in the GTA series technically launched a few days before November, but it still fits the twenty-eight-day timeframe between it and the final game on this list. Moreover, I could never leave it out over something so trivial. While the previous installments in the franchise were already highly popular, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas reached an entirely new dimension when it dropped into the gaming market. The game outsold Vice City by 45% in its first week, selling 4.5 million units.</p>
<p>It would become the best-selling game in a crowded year, thanks to universal critical acclaim (95/100 on Metacritic) and some good old-fashioned mainstream controversy due to the infamous Hot Coffee minigame. The acclaim and sales were well-earned, as San Andreas improved over Vice City in every area: gameplay, visuals, world size, features, etc., setting a new standard for open-world titles.</p>
<p>As for my take at the time, I wasn't the biggest GTA fan back then, so it wasn't my most anticipated title. Perhaps it's because the previous title featured highly repetitive missions and merely passable plots, but San Andreas was the game that leveled up both areas, allowing Rockstar to sit on the open world games throne for a long time.</p>

<h2>Counter-Strike: Source - November 1, 2004</h2>
<p>The only remake on this list, Counter-Strike: Source brought the popular competitive first-person shooter game to modern technology. It was the first game to launch on the market with Valve's new Source engine, and the studio (which was helped by Turtle Rock Studios on this project) used it as a sort of Trojan horse for Half-Life 2, bundling it with all copies of that game before it was eventually released as a standalone product.</p>
<p>The visual upgrade was massive and certainly enticed many new users to check out the series, not to mention the praise from reviewers, who awarded the game an 88/100 score on average. While some hardcore players maintained that the original Counter-Strike had deeper gameplay, CS:S eventually won over the wider community, as evidenced by the 96% positive user reviews on Steam. It helped Counter-Strike stay relevant for another eight years before the launch of Global Offensive in 2012.</p>
<p>Personally, I was always way more of a fan of Rainbow Six, but Counter-Strike's tight-knit community impressed me even then. That they managed to not only maintain but even expand such a high level of commitment from fans after all these years is commendable.</p>

<h2>Halo 2 - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>With Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie forever changed the landscape for first-person shooters in console gaming. At that time, the consensus was that PC was the platform to go to when it came to FPS titles. Halo erased that stereotype and became the biggest Xbox exclusive, creating an enormous amount of hype for its sequel. Microsoft pushed for this to be more than just another game launch, treating it like the biggest blockbuster movies. Its trailer aired in theaters, and there was even an alternative reality game called I Love Bees that attracted a lot of attention to the release.</p>
<p>The goal was largely achieved, as the game grossed $125 million on its opening day, more than Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, cementing gaming's new status as the biggest entertainment medium in the world. Overall, Halo 2 was tied with GTA: San Andreas regarding the 95/100 review score, while GTA ultimately outsold it thanks to its availability on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>In this case, I was absolutely part of the large user base that followed this launch very closely. I loved the predecessor and thoroughly enjoyed the sequel despite the controversial campaign choices. When it comes to gameplay and multiplayer features, Halo 2 might just be the best the series has ever been to this day.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SI_GCN_MetroidPrime2Echoes-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>On the same day, Nintendo launched the sequel to 2002's Metroid, a first-person adventure game with shooter elements. Developed like the original by Texas-based company Retro Studios, it garnered widespread praise for its visuals, level design, and longevity (the game required more than 20 hours to complete), averaging a 92/100 score on Metacritic. It was also the first installment in the series to add multiplayer support, although it wasn't exactly its strongest feature.</p>
<p>Nintendo even tried to mimic Halo 2's viral marketing with some fake websites. However, the game's commercial success was nowhere near the likes of Halo 2 due to the underwhelming sales of Nintendo's GameCube platform. It took many years for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to become a million-seller, although that is no fault of the game itself, which to this day is considered to be one of the best entries in a revered franchise.</p>
<p>While I owned a GameCube, I had sold it already by that point. As such, I did not play Metroid Prime 2 at launch, though I wished I had after seeing all the glowing reviews and impressions online. Despite the not-so-strong sales, this sequel ensured the IP would continue to be one of the most anticipated by Nintendo fans.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Half-Life 2 - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>The following day, Valve released Half-Life 2. It had been six years since the original game had reinvented the single player first-person shooter genre, and the hype was already at dangerously high levels. On top of that, as said before, Valve bundled Counter-Strike Source with the game, ensuring people would get Half-Life 2 despite the then-controversial requirement to install it through Steam, their new digital store.</p>
<p>That alone would probably be enough to make it worth remembering, given the huge impact Steam would have on the gaming landscape. But Half-Life 2 was far more than that. Like GTA: San Andreas for open world games, HL2 showed gaming that shooters could be much more immersive and story-driven without sacrificing any gameplay depth. Reviewers clearly agreed, rating it 96/100 on average, the highest score for a game released in 2004.</p>
<p>When I played it on my PC, I couldn't believe its visuals. Back then, the newly released Source engine was the most advanced piece of technology available, and it also came with the built-in Havok physics engine to deliver far higher levels of interactivity with the environments than gamers were used to. The combination of the two left me in awe, to say the least, although I did have a personal issue while playing: motion sickness. I've never had a problem playing first-person games, but something in Half-Life 2 always left me vaguely nauseous after around twenty minutes. A pity, as it's clearly one of the best shooters ever made. Now, I can't wait to see the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix project</a> be released and try once again to step in the shoes of Gordon Freeman.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/8bbb356c33d8a97cd6ec70793c81aa29d55680f38e93688d61d69fe3fa831719-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>Half-Life 2 wasn't the only Source game to launch that day. Independent developer Troika Games, founded by some of the former creators of Fallout, also launched Vampire: The Masquerade -Bloodlines on November 16. However, being the first third-party developer to use Source came at a cost. The studio understandably had no experience with it and encountered several problems during development. As a result, the game was very buggy, which impacted its reception. Releasing in the middle of the busiest gaming month ever didn't help sales, which were a mere 80K units at launch.</p>
<p>Troika was later forced to close down, but the game garnered a lot of well-deserved respect and admiration over time for its excellent writing and atmosphere. For a long time, Bloodlines was synonymous with great choices and writing among RPG fans, becoming a respected IP despite the lack of big sales. This explains why a sequel is currently in the final stages of production. Bloodlines 2 will be a different game by a different developer, but at least there's another RTX Remix project for those who'd like to replay this classic RPG with modern graphics.</p>
<p>As an avid fan of roleplaying games, I absolutely loved Bloodlines and can still remember some of its most memorable moments, such as the creepy Ocean House Hotel mission. If you haven't played it yet and you are into the World of Darkness setting, it's still worth checking it out on the next Steam sale.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEaterMasterCollectionVersion-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - November 17, 2004</h2>
<p>Another day, another masterpiece. While Xbox had Halo 2 and Nintendo had Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Sony could count on Konami's latest game in the revered MGS series. Once again designed and written by legendary creator Hideo Kojima, Snake Eater serves as a prequel to the entire franchise, featuring Naked Snake (also known as Big Boss) on a peculiar mission in the jungle. The game featured extensive new features, such as closed-quarter combat (CQC), camouflage, an injury system, and even some protosurvival elements that required players to eat regularly lest they suffer penalties to the stamina meter. With a Metacritic score of 91/100 and solid sales (2.6 million units by December 2004), the success was guaranteed.</p>
<p>To understand how iconic Metal Gear Solid 3 really is, just take a look at Konami's remake approach. They've picked Silent Hill 2 for their horror series and MGS3 for their action/adventure/stealth franchise because they are the most universally beloved installments in the respective franchises.</p>
<p>The great news is that if you haven't played the original, Konami has almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished</a> remaking it. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater should launch early next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, allowing an entirely new generation of fans to check out this masterpiece. This includes myself, as I did not own a PlayStation 2 anymore at that time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/World-of-Warcraft-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft - November 23, 2004</h2>
<p>Another hugely anticipated game was Blizzard's MMORPG set in the Warcraft universe. Fans had come to love the fantasy IP through three strategy games, but it was with World of Warcraft that Blizzard's franchise really exploded into critical mass. WoW was not the first MMORPG, but its innovations in accessibility (chiefly the reduced friction upon the player character's death), its vast and gorgeously styled game world, not to mention the well-designed classes, ushered in a new era for the genre. Following a highly positive critical reception of 93/100, the game continued attracting players for several years. The previous record for active subscribers was EverQuest's 500K accounts; World of Warcraft reached 12 million subscribers in 2010.</p>
<p>Rival companies spawned countless clones, but none ever came close to achieving the same level of success in the genre. World of Warcraft is, of course, the only game on the list that is still being <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-2-0-and-warcraft-i-ii-remastered-out-now-world-of-warcraft-to-get-housing-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a>, although the original gameplay style was so successful that Blizzard created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-cataclysm-season-of-discovery-qa-we-want-to-explore-some-of-the-unfinished-bits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic</a> mode.</p>
<p>For me, World of Warcraft was simply a home for so many years. I started playing in December 2004 during the European Closed Beta Test and remember being absolutely mesmerized by this huge online world despite not even being a big fan of the RTS games. MMORPGs turned out to be my favorite genre after all, and I spent countless hours between 2004 and 2011 in Azeroth, enjoying World of Warcraft's content and finding new friends in various guilds, too.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends and often find yourself in the Support position, there are a variety of ways you can help out your lane partner. Whether you want to <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be someone</a> who has a lot of crowd control, healing, or shielding, there is a lot of variety available for the Support. Some are a lot easier than others, and this guide will tell you all about the easiest supports to pick up if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">other guide on the best ADCs to play in League of Legends</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner Supports in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of champions you can play as a support, with some of them being off-meta and not being listed as a support as their primary role. However, those champions tend to be a bit more complicated. If you're getting into the game and are planning on laning with a friend, being a Support is a great way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Soraka</strong> is an excellent support and has been a mainstay in the game since her introduction to the title when it was first released. She has the capability to damage, silence, and heal, giving her plenty of versatility. You can use your ability to heal an ally, which will siphon your health. However, your damaging ability will heal you as long as you hit the enemy champion. Soraka's ultimate is one of the best support ultimate, as it can heal every living ally. This is great to utilize in team fights or if you're in an aggressive lane and need to clutch heal you or your ADC.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sona</strong> is another fantastic support you can use, as she has a lot of utility, as she can heal, stun, damage and speed up allies. Sona is relatively easy to learn, as her abilities don't require any aiming except for her ultimate, which has a wide range. The only downside to Sona for beginners is trying to keep an eye on her mana usage and making sure to utilize her passive correctly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yuumi</strong> is quite possibly one of the easiest champions that you can play in League of Legends. The premise of Yuumi is to attach yourself to your laning partner so that you can heal them. However, during this time, you won't be able to deal any damage to the enemies. Despite that, you are completely invulnerable until the champion you're attached to dies, which is when you become separated and can heal and damage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> takes a little bit more finesse but is still relatively easy to get to grips with as a beginner. Blitzcrank is a different kind of support in League of Legends, as he doesn't have any capability to heal or shield his allies. However, he has great crowd control, which can help set up some great kills. Depending on how you build Blitzcrank, you may even see yourself netting some of the kills, especially with your Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best supports to start with in League of Legends if you're brand-new to the game. There are plenty more to try out, which you can do in bot games if you are worried about annoying your teammates.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-to-invest-%E2%80%98significantly-less%E2%80%99-in-payday-3%E2%80%99s-second-year-of-content.1038033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent financial update, Starbreeze’s leadership team revealed that it will shrink the team working on Payday 3 going into the game’s second year of content, and invest ‘significantly less’ overall. However, the company has assured players and shareholders that this won’t impact the value delivered to gamers worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-less-is-more">Less is More</h2>



<p>Starbreeze revealed in a recent financial report that Payday 2’s sales contributions were still a whopping 50% of the value of Payday 3’s contributions. That’s a representative example of the staying power of the second game, while the third game has long struggled with player retention.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the interim CEO of Starbreeze, Mats Juhl, said that the company is ‘leveraging the strength of its franchises’ to continue succeeding going into 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This time last year we had just launched PAYDAY 3 – a milestone for us as a studio, and a commercial success, but also a launch marred by a series of technical issues. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to improve the game and expand the amount of content and features. </p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, we had launched four major DLCs as well as a large amount of updates to both functionality and content for all of our players. At the end of October, one of our biggest updates since launch was launched, with a brand new user interface, server browser, VoIP and much more.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He mentioned midway through his statement that…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was highlighted that the sentiment around Payday 3 is improving across all channels, which is true. The game has recovered somewhat from the terrible launch it underwent, even if the player base has dwindled considerably since release.</p>



<p>Starbeeze will continue to deliver content for Payday 3 going into 2025, but perhaps at a slower cadence. The team is hard at work on Project Baxter, and Juhl revealed that the company is on an expansion initiative, fleshing out roles to support the development of the new game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Suggests More League Shows Will Follow in Arcane’s Footsteps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-suggests-more-league-shows-will-follow-in-arcane%E2%80%99s-footsteps.1038015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Arcane set a record as the most expensive animated television series ever, coming in at a whopping $250 million for just two seasons. It has been a roaring success, though – and fans are lapping up the content, especially now that the League of Legends World Championship has wrapped up.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Arcane is a masterclass in animation, and it’s picking up some seriously high praise from fans worldwide. In a recent post on Twitter, one of Riot Games’ co-founders, Marc Merrill, revealed that Riot Games isn’t done with these animated shows, despite the third season of Arcane being cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-want-more">We Want More</h2>



<p>In a simple post on Twitter, Marc Merrill revealed that ‘there are lots of other stories to tell’. He was responding to a question asking why there won’t be more seasons of Arcane.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, Merrill was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending the budget</a> that Riot Games blew through in the production of Arcane’s first and second seasons:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends has been running for more than a decade and remains one of the most storied and lore-heavy games in existence. It has a thriving community backing it up, and millions of people are more than willing to soak up whatever multimedia offerings Riot Games can produce.</p>



<p>Perhaps a budget adjustment will take place, though. With Riot Games spending $250 million to produce 18 episodes of a show, many have questioned the sustainability of the company’s coffers. If that’s trimmed up, maybe we’ll get something with more meat on the bones – who knows?</p>



<p>Do you want to see more animated shows coming out of the League of Legends camp? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Among the most impressive aspects of the PlayStation 5 Pro is its ability to deliver much better performance than the base model while consuming similar power.</p>
<p>As part of their in-depth testing of the recently released console by Sony, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDp1C_4AD4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tested the PlayStation 5 Pro power consumption running different games, including Elden Ring, which was not patched to take advantage of the system's unique features, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which did receive a PS5 Pro patch. In both games, the mid-generation refresh in Quality Mode consumed as much as the PlayStation 5 Slim while delivering much better performance and image quality, although the Slim console used for the test may have had some issues, as it was consuming more power than expected. Still, even compared to the base launch model, the new console's efficiency is very impressive, consuming around the same power to deliver significant improvements in both patched and unpatched. Additionally, this is highly indicative that the two systems' SoCs were produced using different process nodes, likely 4nm for the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Power Consumption Tested vs PS5 Slim vs Launch PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDp1C_4AD4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely a worthy purchase for those looking to experience PS5 games at their very best. In games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system delivers significant improvements that enhance the experience considerably. The system is also delivering great 8K modes, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky 8K mode</a>, which is so good that it could start to change minds regarding the viability of such a high resolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty player base wanted the Prestige back to how it used to be, and Treyarch and Activision have delivered. The old-school setup is back, but you need to reach a certain level to hit Prestige 1 in Black Ops 6—and we know which one. </p>



<p>I fall into the boomer category when it comes to CoD. I miss having fewer attachments, need an abundance of intricately woven three-lane maps, and yearn for the classic Prestige system. Leveling up and earning a new Prestige icon was a joy, and the challenge of unlocking all weapons and equipment again was special. </p>



<p>Activision heard our cries, and the Prestige system many of us grew up with is back with a triumphant bang. For many of you, this way of Prestiging is probably foreign. So, I’m going to run through the level you need to reach to hit Prestige 1—and beyond—and give you a quick run-through of what happens.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prestige-in-black-ops-6">How to Prestige in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first of many Prestige screens. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must complete Level 55 to unlock the ability to Prestige in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a clear set of instructions in case you missed the in-game prompts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 main multiplayer menu.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Barracks</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Progression</strong>.</li>



<li>Now choose <strong>Prestige</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Hold the Triangle on PlayStation, Y on Xbox</strong>, or the applicable button on other formats to see Prestige Details.</li>



<li>When it gives you the option, press <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>



<li>Press <strong>Continue </strong>again.</li>



<li>Finally, <strong>hold the required button for several seconds to officially Prestige</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>To be clear, if you reach Level 55, <strong>this isn’t enough</strong>—you need to get to the <em>end </em>of Level 55 to gain access to the Prestige option. Once you do this, BLOPS 6 informs you, and you’re left with a difficult decision, do you stay, or do you go on?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-you-prestige-in-black-ops-6">What Happens When You Prestige in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If you choose to Prestige,<strong> your player level resets to one</strong>, <strong>your player icon changes to a universal symbol that remains through your Prestige 1 run</strong>, and you can <strong>unlock a heap of goodies for hitting certain milestones</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-level">Player Level</h3>



<p>Yes, even though you’ve spent hours increasing your player rank, enabling the Prestige function resets the number straight back to one. Effectively, you start again, and it means you need to re-unlock everything—save for one weapon, piece of equipment, or Perk of your choosing.</p>



<h3 id="h-icon-change">Icon Change</h3>



<p>Your first run through Black Ops 6’s online multiplayer gives you a fresh icon for hitting new levels, However, with Prestige, each time you do it, you’re given a fixed icon from levels 1-55. Per <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a>, Black Ops 6 Prestige icons are special though as they are “themed around a title in Black Ops history.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>Prestiging gives you instant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige rewards</a> but also offers incentives throughout the entire Prestige journey. For example, you can earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Charms, and even Blueprints. Think of Prestige less like a daunting endeavor, and more challenging and replayable journey to carry you to the ultimate glory—the final Prestige icon!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Left 4 Dead 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 17, 2024. Below, we look at how its cast and their interactions set it apart from its contemporaries and modern imitators alike.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead-2/">Left 4 Dead 2</a> has been rightfully receiving its flowers for the past 15 years. The modding community has come up with everything from visual enhancements like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121339498">improved blood textures</a> to completely user-made <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122444796">campaigns</a>. The last two DLCs for the game, Cold Stream and The Last Stand, were made by community members and officially endorsed by Valve. At the time of writing, there are over 45,000 players in-game on PC, and (if you somehow still don't own it) you can play it for free during this anniversary weekend. As such, the Steam discussions are filled with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/">dozens of threads</a> about the Good Guy Nick Achievement, which can only be obtained when the game is on a free weekend, something that occurs every couple of years.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's a special legacy Left 4 Dead has left behind: Valve's shooter has been a catalyst for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">new subgenre altogether</a>. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/back-4-blood-review-reanimated/1900-6417761/">Back 4 Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-anacrusis/">The Anacrusis</a> follow the formula closely, which isn't surprising considering the development teams include people who worked on Left 4 Dead. Others, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2/">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-fireteam-elite-suicide-squad/1900-6417719/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> iterate on the concept of a co-op shooter by leaning closer to its own worlds, taking inspiration from existing franchises or coming up with brand-new mechanics to stand out from the rest. Yet, as more developers are taking the genre in interesting new directions, there's one crucial element that is often overlooked in these iterations.</p><p dir="ltr">The passage of time has not diminished Left 4 Dead 2's strengths. The clever "AI Director" dictating and reacting to the pace and behavior of your group to the B-movie flair embedded in every corner are standouts. But if there's one thing that entices me to return to the game, and a crucial aspect that none of the Left 4 Dead-likes have managed to achieve to a similar degree, is the cast of characters and the personality each of them oozes.</p><p dir="ltr">This was a strong suit even in the first Left 4 Dead with Zoey, Francis, Louis, and Bill. From the moment you set foot on the first rooftop on your way to Mercy Hospital, the frequent character interactions are put front and center. The quips can be further extended (on PC) by using a conversation wheel to express yourself drawing from a pool of hundreds of lines for laughing, cursing, and thanking others. While neither game was ever story-driven, you get to learn more about the characters' personalities thanks to these conversations, and how they interact with each other throughout the campaigns. As a result, I cared more for their survival within the world itself, and not just from a sole gameplay standpoint of reviving a friend during a horde rush. As time passed, I found Bill's incidental role as a parental figure to be endearing, and Francis' constant complaints became a running joke rather than making him an annoying character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535"></a><figcaption>The cast of Left 4 Dead </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Left 4 Dead 2 took this foundation further with Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis: Some smaller details include voice command shouts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/ag00r4/left_4_dead_2_your_character_will_shout_the/" rel="nofollow ">being louder or quieter</a> when calling other characters' names depending on the distance from each other, or the iconic Easter egg in the Dark Carnival campaign where the cast sings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEs_dbZjyI">song excerpts</a> if you interact with the microphone on stage during the final fight. But there's a greater focus on highlighting the characters--unlike the first Left 4 Dead campaign, No Mercy, the group begins the sequel not knowing each other's names in Dead Center. They're eventually introduced to one another and establish a bond over the later episodes. The DLCs, as well as the integration of Left 4 Dead into Left 4 Dead 2, are proof of Valve extending the philosophy to the original cast as well, with The Passing uniting both groups in the same campaign, and The Sacrifice adding another sentimental layer as an overarching narrative involving Bill.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back at all the late nights I've had playing with friends during the past 15 years, I believe the characters are responsible for tying the whole experience together. They remain singular in nature, resulting in a sense of personality that is yet to be matched. Some jokes and banter lines, such as Nick remarking on Ellis' excitement over the carnival Kiddie Land by saying, "He's like a five-year-old, with guns and a comprehensive grasp of every swear word in the English language," and the multiple variants for friendly fire reactions like Ellis' "I am not a zombie, shoot the zombies!" never get tiresome.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, the future of Left 4 Dead is uncertain. In 2023, people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files" rel="nofollow ">found a mention</a> of "Left4Dead3" in Counter-Strike 2's files, albeit with the downside that, according to the files, the project's priority is "none" for Valve. This follows a series of similar I Want to Believe mentions throughout the years in other titles like Half-Life: Alyx and Portal VR, including more concrete details in The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx documentary, where it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve" rel="nofollow ">revealed</a> that Left 4 Dead 3 was supposed to be an open-world game set in Morocco, only to be canceled due to game engine Source 2's unfinished status at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to know if a third entry could capture the charm and chemistry of the existing characters with a new group once more. Despite having replayed the campaigns dozens of times over the years, however, I'm still discovering interactions by the cast. And even when I'm not, joining a lobby feels like revisiting old friends at this point. Picking a character in Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't give you any different perks--each one of them can use all weapons, and their survival depends on your skills and cooperation with others alone. The game's most noteworthy achievement, then, is giving importance to that decision regardless of its importance--choosing the eyes from which to see the apocalypse through is as memorable as your efforts to make it out alive with that character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re in a pretty good moment for sprawling, complex role-playing games. New releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Dragon Age Absolution</em></a>, along with older titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">including this year’s expansion</a>), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23861883/baldurs-gate-3-ps5-technical-review"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> have sucked millions of people into their expansive worlds. They can be all-consuming experiences, offering players all kinds of freedom to explore their worlds and characters. But honestly? Sometimes I don’t want to fuss with conversation wheels or make difficult, narrative-altering choices. I just want to go on a big adventure and slowly turn into an overpowered hero fighting monsters — and that’s where the excellent new remake of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> comes in.</p><p>The game originally came out way back in 1988 (it was initially called <em>Dragon Warrior 3</em> in North America) and it has a refreshingly straightforward premise: you’re on a quest to kill a great evil that your father failed to destroy many years before. There are a few colorful characters, but there isn’t a whole lot else to it beyond a quest for revenge. This isn’t a game you play for the story. Instead, it’s about going on adventures, exploring strange and dangerous locations, and killing lots of cute blue slimes.</p><p>That simplicity has stood the test of time rather well, with systems that are easy to grasp while still offering a challenge (even if the regular battles can eventually get tedious). This is a good thing, because the remake doesn’t change all that much. The exploration and turn-based battles all still feel largely as they did. This means that the game follows a largely predictable path, as you go from one dungeon to the next, visiting towns in between to rest and gear up for the next challenge. There are some additions, like a new character class that lets you collect monsters, along with additional story scenes to flesh out the barebones narrative.</p><p>Though it’s mostly the same as the original, there are major changes to the presentation and some notable quality of life features. To start, this version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> looks incredible. It uses the same visual style as games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561880/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Octopatch Traveller</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22960053/triangle-strategy-nintendo-switch-interview"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, which Square Enix awkwardly calls “HD 2D.” Basically, these are still games with pixel art characters, but they explore incredibly detailed worlds. The developers then throw in a tilt-shift effect that gives the whole thing a diorama-like appearance. The result is a game that looks decidedly old-school, but in a slick, modern way. I especially love the adorable monster animations in battle. There’s also an updated orchestral score performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, along with all-new voice acting.</p><p>It’s more than just an aesthetic overhaul, though. The <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake also makes some very smart tweaks that often make it less frustrating to play. These include a more useful map that makes it easier to find where you’re headed, an option to speed up battles so you can grind quicker, and a handful of difficulty options. These may sound small, but they’re the kind of modern conveniences that can make many older games difficult to play, especially ones built around repetitive combat like a classic RPG. Smoothing out those few rough edges has a big impact on the overall feel of a game like <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>.</p><p>Even though it’s technically the third game of the series, this version of <em>Dragon Quest</em> is also a great place for newcomers to see what the series is all about (and really, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790204/dragon-quest-11-review-ps4-steam">things haven’t changed all that much over the years</a>). It’s a pretty, approachable way to experience an epic quest without getting overwhelmed by story or features. It’s just you, some swords and magic, and a whole lot of monsters to defeat. Sometimes, that’s all you really need.</p><p><small>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D<em> is available now on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>20 years after its 2004 debuted, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> has broken its own concurrent player record on Steam.</p>
<p>According to SteamDB, the seminal shooter has secured just over a 61.7K player peak over the weekend, the highest number of simultaneous players the game has achieved since records began in 2008.</p>
<p>In fact, the number I've just written is probably already out of date - the number is still rising and has been all day, having increased several times in the time I've been writing this.</p>

<p>Given this weekend's surprise release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, it's possible players are jumping back into the game to revel in nostalgia or possibly check out the new director's commentary. It's also possible - given Valve is currently giving away the game for free - new players are trying it for the first time.</p><p>If you haven't seen it yet, in the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary now available on YouTube</a>, the Half-Life 2 development team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-episode-3-doesnt-exist-because-left-4-dead-does">Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting Left 4 Dead "out the door"</a>.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre. "It took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Treyarch has enabled, disabled, and is now reintroducing legacy XP tokens in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - free and premium content, a new Zombies "experience in-season", and full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-has-so-much-content-this-infographic-hurts-our-eyes">Black Ops 6's Season 1</a> also introduced something else - legacy XP tokens.</p>
<p>Turns out the latter was an accident, though, as no sooner did players spot legacy XP tokens in the new shooter, developer Treyarch "fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed legacy XP tokens to be activated in Black Ops 6 UI".</p>

<p>"We realise how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update. This allows us time to ensure stability is maintained before we reintroduce this feature.</p><p>"In the interim, players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone.

<p>As well as sharing stunning concept art and gameplay prototypes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> team reunited in the documentary to talk about the development of Episode 2.</p>
<p>The developers also revealed that Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> "out the door".</p>

<p>"Left 4 Dead needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre.</p>
<p>"It was a really tight shipping schedule and it required a lot of work from everybody to get it out the door. It was worth it - I mean, Left 4 Dead came out great. But it took long enough - and this is the tragic and almost comical thing about it - it took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have <em>definitely</em> gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p>
<p>The documentary also delves into specific details like weapon design, such as the ice gun that could be used to create cover, ascend over obstructions, or provide players makeshift ledges to get down the side of mountains, and so on.</p>
<p>But at the end of documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell admitted that one of the reasons Episode 3 never came to be was because his "personal failure was being stumped".</p>
<p>"You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. [But] that's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Yes, of course, they loved the story - they love many, many aspects of it, but sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next…</p>
<p>"You know, we could have shipped it. Like, it wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p>
<p>The team did, however, reflect that if Episode 3 <em>had</em> been realised, we may not have seen other sequels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a>.</p>
<p>Newell also added that without Episodes, Dota may not have been made.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the Episodes, there'd be no such thing as Dota. I know that sounds really weird, but it was the things that we learned in developing the Episodes that led to, you know, Team Fortress 2, to more rapid updates."</p><p>The full documentary is available to watch online above. Don't forget that to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary this weekend, Valve also released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, bundling in commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Insomniac Games has been the bedrock for PlayStation Studios since the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>. Already in this console generation, there’s been three major game releases that have led the way for the rest of PlayStation Studios to follow, and now all of their games have been upgraded for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, patching support back in for three fairly distinct eras of game.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro vs. Insomniac –&nbsp;Spider-Man 2, R&amp;C Rift Apart and Miles Morales compared" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgB-UiaYqIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5/">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> was their first effort on PS5, a smaller game between the main numbered entries that could iterate on the superhero series, and a cross-gen release. This brought an upgrade to the late PS4-era game engine from Spider-Man –&nbsp;heck they also remastered that game at the same time – slotting in ray-tracing effects to showcase what the PS5 could do over the PS4 in that department, and using those new ray-traced reflections to really capture the essence of New York City’s many glass sky scrapers.</p>



<p>At launch it had two distinct modes, 30fps with ray tracing and 60fps without, but they quickly dipped back in to share more optimisations with players, introducing a 40fps mode for people with 120Hz screens, as well as a cut down Performance RT mode that still managed to bring in ray tracing while keeping a 60fps target. The trade offs? 1440p as opposed to 4K, and with effects quality at lower resolutions and lower densities as well.</p>

<p>PS5 Pro now has a new Performance Pro graphics mode in both Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales, and it’s easy to recommend. This aims to get the full fat fidelity mode at 60FPS through the use of PSSR, with all ray-tracing features enabled at their full quality. Essentially, I would expect that (without doing any pixel peeping) it’s effectively lifted the frame rate cap on fidelity mode, and is just accepting of a possibly wider dynamic resolution when needed, barely losing any tangible quality thanks to PSSR.</p>

<p>It looks pretty great, as a straightforward upgrade, though this is starting to feel like an older game now and is well within what the base PS5 can handle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5/">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a> might have arrived around half a year after the PS5’s launch, but this was already s big jump forward for Insomniac and PS5 exclusives, a real showcase for both ray tracing and the PS5’s SSD. Again, at launch it had a 30FPS ray tracing mode and 60fps without, and again, it got the same 40fps mode and performance RT after launch… and once again, Performance RT really is the go-to for most people, even if this style of shooter platformer is a very nice feeling game in fidelity mode.</p>
<p>But there’s more deeply integrated ray-tracing throughout the game world on so many more surfaces and even characters, and so the PS5 Pro offers two modes. Performance Pro is similar to Miles Morales, using PSSR to push the base PS5’s fidelity mode through at 60fps, and considering that there was enough headroom in the PS5 to already do this fidelity mode at 40fps, it’s no surprise that the PSSR assisted upgrade looks fantastic here.</p>

<p>But then there’s also a new 30fps Fidelity Pro mode and this pushes the boat out in a few key ways. One thing that can be spotted is an increase in the number of pedestrians and onlookers, filling out the crowd in the opening scene as an easy touch point, as well as some beefed up ray tracing. RT Reflections bump up from a half render resolution – so a 4K output would have 1080p reflections – to a full render resolution, and that’s also accounting for any dynamic resolutions. For comparison, the base PS5 has half render resolution for its Fidelity mode and quarter resolution for its Performance RT mode. There is significantly more clarity to the myriad shiny surfaces through the game, though there’s also a lot of distorted and scuffed up surfaces that make the reflection resolution less noticeable.</p>

<p>Added to this is RT Ambient Occlusion, which was seen in the PC version of Rift Apart. This uses ray-tracing to augment the standard Screen Space AO, bringing more realistic shading and contact shadows, helping objects blend together as a scene more naturally. It’s an interesting one, as it can make shadows more subtle in some areas and stronger in others, while the screen space global illumination bounce lets some light colour transfer, but the stylised nature of Rift Apart maybe makes this less impactful than it could have been – especially as the game was initially designed without it.</p>

<p>Both actually have separate menu options once you engage Fidelity Pro, defaulting to High quality for both effects, though you can step reflections back down to Medium, and RTAO has a Medium and an Off setting –&nbsp;medium removes the screen space GI bounce. There could be a minor frame rate benefit for those playing at 40fps on a 120Hz screen or without a frame cap using VRR, but we couldn’t test this out.</p>
<p>In general, Performance Pro is going to be the way to go here if you just have a 60Hz screen,&nbsp;just as Performance RT was for the base game. I think there’s a benefit to sharpness here over PS5, especially given the fuzzy characters that fill the cutscenes in particular and the style of reflection use throughout the game world – it’s just the right side of excess that higher quality reflections can really add to the game compared to the equivalent graphics mode on base PS5.</p>
<p>And so we come to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, and this game really shows the growth and maturity of ray tracing within Insomniac games. The studio really knocked it out of the park here on base PS5, going all-in and only offering Fidelity and Performance RT modes, without a fallback mode that omitted ray tracing. That naturally carries through to the PS5 Pro with both Fidelity Pro and Performance Pro modes.</p>
<p>It’s a familiar story, with PSSR helping Performance Pro get the standard Fidelity mode up to 60FPS, while Fidelity Pro bringing some additional higher quality and optional ray tracing features to the table. Of note, Fidelity Pro mode is also able to push level of detail distances out further, which is impressive given the size of the city and the open world scenes you’re often taking in.</p>

<p>The RT Reflections option from R&amp;C becomes RT Reflections &amp; Interiors here, because there’s some black dev magic at play for rendering the rooms in sky scrapers with people and everything –&nbsp;basically there’s secret rooms under the map that are rendered and processed with ray tracing. You only have Medium and High settings with the half and full render resolutions respectively.</p>
<p>Also similar to Rift Apart, there’s the three levels of RT Ambient Occlusion – off as in Performance, Medium and High, as in Fidelity –&nbsp;and it’s again augmenting screen-space AO instead of replacing it, though can provide a good deal of shadowing to a city scape scene.</p>

				RT Key Light Shadows Off
				</dd></dl><br>
		</div>

<p>The Spider-Man 2 exclusive addition is RT Key Light Shadows. This, is all about the city of New York and calculating sun shadows for middle to far distance buildings, replacing the shadow maps from before, and which will be most effective for when you’re out and about and up high, looking for a perfect photo to take. Similar to RTAO, it adds a lot of depth to the image.</p>
<p>What’s nice is that, while swapping Fidelity Pro to Performance Pro requires a restart at a checkpoint, the individual RT toggles can be done without reloading. This does still mean diving into the full settings screen which covers up the game, so back-to-back comparisons in-game are difficult to make unless you take distinct screen grabs, but the main menu lets you apply them with the scenic shots of the two Spider-Men and the city.</p>
<p>Once again, these options are mainly for the tech curious, as there’s really no reason to turn them off in the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Again, maybe there’s an advantage to tuning things down for an improved VRR Fidelity mode? There’s more of a need or desire to play at higher frame rates here, given the action combat of Spider-Man 2, so Fidelity Pro will mainly be for those with the possibility of 40fps or better, while those using a 60Hz screen should probably play in Performance Pro.</p>
<p>Insomniac remain the absolute masters of the PS5 within PlayStation Studios. If game development is a marathon, they’ve been able to sprint through the first half of this generation, and it’s truly impressive to see how rapidly they’ve iterate and grown their game engine and confidence with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The problem for PS5 Pro is that Insomniac’s games already look fantastic on PS5, and come with enough headroom to let people engage optional frame rate modes as well. Sure, there’s compromises when going to Performance RT, such as significantly reduced reflection resolution, but they’re well enough disguised and fleeting enough not to be a detriment. PS5 Pro is able to lift away a lot of those compromises, and even introduce ray tracing features that would otherwise only feature in the PC ports.</p>

</p>
<p>The documentary includes in-progress footage of the episode in action for the first time, and it shows an ice gun and a new liquid enemy type.

<p>The discussion of Episode 3 begins at 1h 52m, with concept art and eventually in-game footage. The in-game footage is all taken from test arenas and tech demos, not finished parts of the game. Various Valve developers say they worked on the episode for around six months, before moving over to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, never to return.
</p><p>There are two main features of the episode discussed. The ice gun let you create geometry by spraying ice, so you could create impromptu cover to hide behind, which soldiers would shoot through and eventually smash. You could also use it directly as a weapon to freeze enemies, or in what is described as a "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silver">Silver</a> Surfer mode", to extrude an ice path in front of yourself as you slid along it.
</p>
<p>An ice gun is thematically appropriate given Episode 3 was due to take place (at least in part) in the Arctic, as Freeman headed to the icebreaker ship Borealis referebced in Episode 2 (and initially planned as a setting for Half-Life 2).
</p>
<p>More interesting is the new enemy type, called "the blobs", which is a descriptive name. They are blobs, like liquid droplets, which can change shape, separate, and sluice around environments. They could absorb other enemies or physics objects, and squeeze (or fall) through grates. 
</p>
<p>It's anyones guess whether these elements would have made it through to a release version of Episode 3, or whether the blobs would have been fun to fight. They certainly look cool, though.
</p>
<p>"I still don't know what that would have been if we'd built it, because it hadn't been built," writer Marc Laidlaw says. "That was the feeling of excitement, of something I can't even imagine is going to happen as a team. I was not imposing a top-down, 'This is what we must do to tell our very important tale.' Y'know, it's like - we have new features? What kind of story can we do with these now?"
</p><p>Laidlaw eventually published a short story telling a version of Episode 3 as essentially fanfiction, though <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life">later told us he regretted the decision</a>. "I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do... until I did it."
</p>
<p>Several Valve employees in the docuemntary offer their own takes on why they never continued with Episode 3. Fatigue after working within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> for so long, doubt about the concept of episodic games, a feeling that they needed to 'go bigger' with the next instalment, excitement about other projects being developed internally including multiplayer games. Several also say that it was a mistake - that they could have and should have gone back to working on it, in retrospect.
</p>
<p>"You can't get lazy and say, 'We're moving the story forward.' That's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Yes, of course they love the story, they love many, many aspects of it. But saying the reason to do it is that people want to know what happens next-- y'know, we could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard," says Gabe Newell. 
</p>
<p>"The failure was, my personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."
</p>
<p>I don't think it's lazy to resolve a story you ended on a cliffhanger. I'm also not sure if developers have an obligation to gamers, but if they do, it's presumably <em>more</em> of a cop out to not make a follow-up at all, thus fully abdicating the responsibility to innovate. On the other hand, it's hard to argue against the ethos that produced Half-Life and Half-Life 2 in the first place, and the several fantastic games in different series that Valve would make in lieu of Episode 3.</p><p>The whole anniversary documentary is worth watching, if you're a Half-Life obsessive like me. There's brief footage in there of Arkane's abandoned <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ravenholm">Ravenholm</a> project, near the end, for example. Valve have also uploaded some separate videos to their YouTube channel, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU4yPEFXzo0">a SIGGRAPH demo from 2000</a>, a never-before-seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CoMdbnJwvE">cancelled E3 2002 demo</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaHtOISsLT4">the E3 2003 demo that eventually went ahead</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> just turned 20 years old, and to celebrate Valve have released an update for their classic first-person shooter. In brief: they've recorded developer commentary; they've added Steam Workshop support; Episodes One and Two are now part of the package; and there are some bug fixes and new graphics options.
</p>
<p>Grab it before the end of the weekend (November 18th at 6pm GMT) and it's also free to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">on Steam</a>.

<p>Episodes 1 and 2 already had developer commentary, as do several other Valve games, but Half-Life 2 never did. This update adds three and a half hours of commentary by members of the Half-Life 2 team, as they try to remember what the heck happened during the making of the game.
</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the story of Half-Life 2's development, the answer is: a lot happened. Valve also partnered with Secret Tape to produce a two-hour documentary on the subject:

<p>Half-Life 2 had a bustling modding community back when, just as its predecessor did, and it's great that Steam Workshop support has been added even if it's late. (Steam Workshop itself was only created in 2011.) It's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/220/workshop/">already filling up with work now</a>.
</p><p>The full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001">fixes and rendering options</a> is too long for me to include here. There are changes to support ultrawide monitors and high FOV settings, increased spawn points in multiplayer maps to thwart players who are a quickdraw with a toilet, and some limits lifted within BSP files allowing for modders to place more brushes and models within their own levels.
</p>
<p>Valve did a similar set of revisions <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-is-steam-deck-verified-with-new-multiplayer-maps-for-its-25th-anniversary">to celebrate the original Half-Life's 25th anniversary last year</a><a></a>. Next year will be the 20th anniversary of Day Of Defeat: Source, so I'm looking forward to the three hour-long documentary about that.
