            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, we announced that our first issue of this new era for <em>Game Informer </em>magazine will <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">feature Borderlands 4 on the cover</a>. Now, we can excitedly show you the actual cover art, share the contents of this jam-packed issue, and let you know that if you're a subscriber, you can <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/borderlands4">read everything in the magazine starting today through our website</a>! And, if you're not subscribed yet, you can still <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/subscribe">take advantage of early-bird pricing</a>!</p><p>We spent two days embedded in Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas, playing exclusive content and talking to many folks behind the highly anticipated looter-shooter. We were the first to get our hands on all four Vault Hunters in the Borderlands 4 base game. We were also the first to explore the Carcadia Burn region, participate in various side activities throughout Gearbox's seamless world, and get a guided tour of Dominion, the Timekeeper's walled city. Within the pages of the cover story, you'll learn exclusive details from our hands-on sessions with the game, as well as our interviews with several members of the leadership and development teams at the studio. And those details will go even more in-depth as our month of coverage rolls out at <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/borderlands4">GameInformer.com/Borderlands4</a>.</p>

<p>But this issue is so much more than just that 12-page cover story. Within the pages of this issue of <em>Game Informer</em>, you'll also find Kyle Hilliard's hardware review of Nintendo Switch 2, Charles Harte's report from Summer Game Fest 2025, and Marcus Stewart's reflections on the Donkey Kong Country area of Super Nintendo World. In addition, I did a deep dive into Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and interviewed several professional skateboarders about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/honoring-two-of-the-most-critically-acclaimed-games-ever" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="11674bee-efb9-4aa2-998d-abf67c077cf4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>'s impact. We also have an excellent piece on the creation of the titular alien in Alien: Isolation from contributor Sab Astley, as well as an interview with Sonic the Hedgehog's original designer, Naoto Ohshima, from contributor James Mielke.&nbsp;</p><p>That's on top of our standard preview suite, which includes recent coverage of games like Grand Theft Auto 6, Resident Evil Requiem, Ninja Gaiden 4, 007 First Light, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, The Outer Worlds 2, and much more! And of course, you can expect the latest reviews of games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Mario Kart World, Elden Ring: Nightreign, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and others.</p>

            <p>Did you know there's a 3v3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> fighting game? Well there is! It's called Ultimate Sonic Smackdown, and you can play it right now.</p>
<p>Indie studio Arcforged has released the game to the public for free. In an announcement trailer released today, you can see a variety of Sonic characters duke it out in 2D. All you've got to do is join the game's official Discord server and get playing!</p>
<p>You may have guessed it from the title, but Ultimate Sonic Smackdown is actually a drastic overhaul of an older fan game: Sonic Smackdown. That game was a traditional 1v1 fighter, and has been playable online via <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> or at US tournaments for a while now.</p>

<p>This iteration, four years in the making, is a wilder evolution of the game. A tagging system means more hectic fights, more options for offence, and the opportunity to team up your favourite Sonic characters in your chosen squad. It's the latest in a sparse scattering of Sonic the Hedgehog fighting games, first established by the official, Sega-developed Sonic the Fighters released in arcades in 1996. Its Sega Saturn port was cancelled.</p>
<p>As a tag fighter, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown joins a bizarrely packed collection of similar games coming out soon. You've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a> coming in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> which is bound to come out sooner or later, c'mon guys. Then you've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/invincible-vs">Invincible Vs</a> coming next year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>! So suddenly, a style of fighting game that had basically no modern representation is stacked with incoming options.
</p>
<p>Sonic has a rich history of fan games. Famously, Sega hired Christian Whitehead to be lead developer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, following his work on unofficial ports of older Sonic games. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-unleashed-available-for-pc-at-last-thanks-to-fan-made-port-with-uncapped-framerate">also a fan-made PC port of Sonic Unleashed</a> which is rad, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-triple-trouble-gets-fan-made-16-bit-makeover">a 16-bit makeover of Sonic Triple Trouble</a> from a few years back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-fantastic-fan-made-sonic-fighting-game-in-the-wild-and-you-can-play-it-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive and Anshar Studios have announced the release date for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painkiller remake.</a> This 'modern reimagining' of the classic 2004 first-person shooter game from People Can Fly will be available on October 9 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now on all storefronts. The Standard Edition of Painkiller can be purchased digitally for $39.99. It includes the “Iron Crusade” skin pack, which features skins for all four playable characters — Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch — as well as skins for six weapons: the Electrodriver, Stakegun, Shotgun, SMG, Hand Cannon, and Rocket Launcher. Pre-orders of the Standard Edition on consoles will come with the “Burnished Pride” retail-exclusive weapons pack, which includes additional gold skins for the aforementioned six weapons. The Deluxe Edition of Painkiller is priced at $49.99. It comes with the “Iron Crusade” pre-order bonus skin pack and three additional post-launch DLCs, each including six weapon skins and four character skins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Pre-order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just like in the original Painkiller, the player character is sentenced to Purgatory for crimes against Heaven. However, the Voice of the Creator gives them one last chance at redemption: blasting through hordes of demons in brutal, fast-paced combat using an array of infernal weapons. Players will fight their way through gruesome, gothic environments to stop Azazel, the fallen angel, from invading Earth, and earn salvation – either alone or with up to two other players in online co-op mode, which is a change from the original, a single player-only experience.</p>
<p>There will be lots of traversal options, such as jump, grappling hook, and dash, for players as they traverse the vast landscapes. They'll face grotesque terrors that range from hordes of demons to titanic terrors such as the monstrous offspring of Azazel, the Nephilim. Character progression sees tarot cards used to upgrade the player character's abilities. Each playable character has unique perks to boost energy, health, power, and damage.</p>

Early models launching before Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are released will have drivers for the 5050 GPU pre-installed.

The desktop RTX 5050 matches the RTX 5060 with 8GB of VRAM, but being GDDR6 and having 1,280 fewer CUDA cores ensures it should have a noticeable gap in performance with the card directly above it.</p><p>Nvidia is claiming the 5050 will be able to deliver “an immersive ray-traced experience with high settings in single-player games such as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Avowed</em>, thanks to DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.” Its chart shows the 5050 achieving over 150 fps in that scenario with 4x MFG turned on. However, keep in mind that the fine print indicates that’s all while the GPU was paired with a $479 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> CPU running at 1080p resolution. In full raster, Nvidia claims the RTX 5050 is about 60 percent faster than the two-generations-old RTX 3050.</p><p>The RTX 5050 is the direct replacement of that RTX 3050, which remains one of the most popular GPUs <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fhwsurvey%2Fvideocard%2F" rel="sponsored">in use on Steam</a>.

            <p>I know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a> only as 1) the vehicular combat sim Emily Gera somehow penned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/british-invasion-war-thunder-adding-tanks-from-blighty">erotic poetry</a> about - "O succulent tank porn and its lusty armour"... Emily! What r u doing. STAHP - and 2) an unofficial information arm for the world's militaries, fuelled by the power of pedantry.</p>
<p>Back in July 2021, an actual tank commander <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-posts-classified-document-to-prove-tank-is-inaccurate">posted classified documents</a> for the Challenger 2 tank on the game's forums in order to prove that the game's representation of said tank is inaccurate. Now, somebody's done likewise for the pride of the United States Air Force: the British-made Harrier Jump Jet.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this latest blowout, a user uploaded a section from a US Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization manual for the AV-8B and TAV-8B Harrier airplanes. Said manual is not approved for public release and restricted to authorised US government bods and their contractors. Gaijin Entertainment's community manager has confirmed that the document breaches the forum's rules on such things, and has handed the user in question a temporary ban.</p>
<p>This and the previous leak of strictly need-to-know ballistic smut were spotted by the <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-data-once-again-leaked-on-war-thunder-forums/">UK Defence Journal</a>, an unaffiliated group of hardcore wonks, including former service members. The latter org say that War Thunder has been a source of leakage at least nine times in total, with previous victims including France's Leclerc, China's ZTZ-99, the Eurocopter Tiger, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the US F-16, F-15E and F-117 jets. In each case, they say, the leak happened because some nerd wanted to win an argument. This is how the world ends, isn't it.</p>
<p>The UK Defence Journal also cite an anonymous former RAF engineer who sizes up the latest breach as follows:</p>
<p>"This probably isn't the biggest leak ever, not at all. These kinds of manuals float around online, especially older ones. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's marked as controlled or restricted, platforms like War Thunder have no choice but to take action."</p>
<p>War Thunder isn't just in the military realism business. The developers are partial to the occasional Gatling gun burst of whimsy, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flying-saucers-take-over-war-thunder-for-april-fools-week">this weeklong flying saucer takeover</a>. No erotic tank designs for the moment, alas, though I guess there's always the modding scene. I am not going to look up the modding scene. I don't want to upset myself.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-once-again-leaks-classified-military-documents-to-win-an-argument]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Chances are if you like the SteamWorld series that this won't matter very much to you, but for those of you (like me) who've never touched a single game, here's something neat: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-dig">SteamWorld Dig</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252410/SteamWorld_Dig/">completely free on Steam right now</a>. That's free to keep forever, to be clear, not one of those free weekend types of deals. It's not free for that long, mind, only from now until June 26th, and I can't give you a specific time on that day, so if you're remotely interested you might as well just add it to your library.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There doesn't seem to be a particular reason as to why it's going free, though there is also a sale on a couple other games in the series right now. Its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-dig-2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a>, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/">currently 94% off</a>, which is as good as free, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134770/SteamWorld_Build/">currently 80% off</a>, with its Mechanized DLC and soundtrack also 35% off. You've got options essentially!

Starting life on the Nintendo 3DS, SteamWorld Dig is a steampunky, western-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> where you play as a robot called Rusty. There's a bit of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> element to it in that you can destroy blocks as you dig further and further, but there's a much bigger focus on exploration and resource gathering as opposed to the repeatable gameplay of the roguelike.
</p>
<p>
Whether we'll see much more of SteamWorld is the next big question though. Last year, Thunderful, the owner of the series, had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-creator-thunderful-announces-80-100-more-layoffs-as-part-of-second-round-of-restructuring">two sets</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thunderful-group-to-implement-restructuring-programme-affecting-around-20-percent-of-staff">layoffs</a>, putting the next entry in the series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-steamworld-is-a-third-person-co-op-action-game">SteamWorld Headhunter</a> on hold for the time being. Doesn't exactly scream confidence.

Well, today is your day thanks to three months for $0.99 for the former and three months free for the latter. It's an epic day for game devs and players too thanks to a cracking deal on a 32" Alienware curved gaming monitor and a massive sound bundle over on Humble.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The epic Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's undercutting big box stores and the collectors market by nearly $100 in some cases. I've looked up the top-valued cards from the box, so you know if it's worth it or not below. Spoiler alert, it is! Let's get into it:</p><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer.

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is currently putting Agent 47 on the backburner while focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">the upcoming James Bond game</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a>. However, the new Bond title may take some cues from Hitman: World of Assassination' live-service approach by adding new missions post-launch.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak hinted at the possibility of providing Bond with ongoing support during an extended interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," said Abrak. "The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</p><p>Abrak went on to note that First Light will feature greater stealth, action, and seamless combat options that let players switch between ranged attacks and melee on the fly. He added that Bond will follow his character's long-standing tradition of driving exotic cars.</p><p>"That gives us more challenges to play with," added Abrak. "In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond."</p><p>The most recently released Hitman elusive target mission may be a good model for any live-service 007 First Light content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. If First Light can draw upon some of the classic villains from Bond's previous films, then there are ample opportunities to revisit some fan-favorites.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous Bond incarnation and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced four new games on the way to its PSVR2 headset, three of which are coming this year.</p>
<p>One of those is Dreams of Another, the next game from Q-Games - the studio behind the PixelJunk games. Dreams of Another is from multimedia artist Baiyon, the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pixeljunk-eden">PixelJunk Eden</a>.</p>
<p>The game sees players control "The Man in Pajamas", but has the philosophy of "No Creation Without Destruction". As such, shooting in this game creates the world around you from circular particles.</p>

<p>I was able to play the game (though not in VR) at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year, and found its use of "point cloud rendering" to be particularly mesmerising. I can only imagine how it'll look in VR, in both third and first person. Dreams of Another is due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Before that, though, there's Grit and Valor - 1949. A tactics rogue-lite, players take the role of a commander in an alternate timeline World War 2 to win battles by moving pieces chess-style on a tactical grid. It's due out on 21st August.</p>

<p>Also coming later this year is Hotel Infinity, a follow-up to Manifold Garden from Studio Chyr. This surreal puzzle game has players exploring an abstract hotel to solve riddles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manifold-garden-review-rewiring-strange-architecture-in-the-void">Manifold Garden received a rare Essential from Eurogamer</a>, so expect good things from this one.</p>

<p>Last up is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/introducing-meteora-a-cosmic-survival-racer-for-ps-vr2/">Meteora</a>, a "cosmic survival racer" coming to PSVR2 next year. Players will navigate "explosive asteroid belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers" as a meteor racing across space. Energy Crystal can increase your mass and Stardust boosts your velocity, but should you focus on survivability or speed?</p>
<p>You can read more about all four games on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/reveals-and-updates-on-upcoming-ps-vr2-titles/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony has been criticised for not supporting its PSVR2 headset. In its latest State of Play showcase, only one VR game was included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-more-than-a-decade-classic-stealth-series-thief-is-being-revived-for-psvr2">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> - though this will also be released on other VR platforms.</p>
<p>The Meta-owned Beat Games also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">ended support for Beat Saber on PS4 and PS5</a>, what many consider to be VR's killer app.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft announced it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset">collaborated with Meta on a limited edition Xbox-themed Quest 3S headset</a>, as the company dips its toes into the world of VR.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remembers-psvr2-exists-announces-four-new-games-coming-soon]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="DS2 MARIO REF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1f45ab2d49ad/ds2-mario-ref.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Kojima Productions</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, as you'll likely know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Hideo Kojima</a>'s incredibly good walking simulator, has got itself a fancy big sequel this week in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and we've been playing it in what little free time we've got (well, this writer has, at least) over on the old PlayStation side of things.</p>
<p>You'll be pleased to know that this writer has discovered some vague, possible Mario references in the second game, and it's only early days!</p>
<p>The references-of-sorts relate to some Mushroom Badges, which are available to sew onto a backpack in the game from the get-go. There a few different mushroom badges, even a triple set - just like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>! Can it be a coincidence?</p>
<p>As it turns out these Mushroom Kingdom-styled mushies, rather than just being random as all hell, are actually found in the game world of Death Stranding 2, and its predecessor, (hey, they pop up when you pee!), so it stands to reason that the badges are simply tied innocently to this whole mechanic.</p>

<p>However, we're suspect of this being entirely and purely coincidental, especially given the choice of a Fly Agaric mushroom over any of the millions of other types you could have chosen.</p>
<p>Yes, you may argue that this type of mushroom appears in lots of games, possibly way more than any other, but then you'd be kicking this theory right in the Sam Porters, which isn't very nice. Anyway, the game, as you can see from our images, calls them "Golden Toadstools", so we're still 100% behind our working theory!</p>
<p>If you've played the original Death Stranding, then this probably won't surprise you. You'll already know, possibly by way of a lot of cringing, that the game contains references to Mario and Princess Peach, with one very on the nose line in particular, as seen in the clip below (warning, it's worse than you may remember).</p>

<p>Rightio! There are many discussions online about comparisons between the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Mario and Peach</a> relationship mirroring that of the leads in Death Stranding, but we'll let you dig your own hole there.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to check back in if we find any Bullet Bill in Death Stranding 2 in the meantime.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Is this yet more proof that Hideo Kojima is the world's biggest Princess Peach fan? Let us know what you reckon!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>3D Realms has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, and if you've been waiting for the chance to try this one out, you'll be able to do so later this year.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is developed by Anshar Studios, will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 9th. No mention of a Switch or Switch 2 version of the game has been made.</p>

<p>Since the release date has been announced, pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>are now also open, and if you pre-order the game, you'll get yourself a set of Iron Crusade character and weapon skins into the bargain.</p>

<p>The game was developed by People Can Fly, the studio that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">currently helping out The Coalition</a> with development on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>(and, sadly, also the studio that recently had to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel two projects and lay off staff</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, the new version will revolve around co-op play, and it'll contain hero shooter elements as well; you'll play as one of four characters, each of whom has their own unique perks with which to slay demons.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, though; this version of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is still all about killing hordes of rampaging monsters, and it looks like the outlandish weapons and over-the-top feel of the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>have made it across to the reboot intact.</p>




<p><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>arguably shares some challenges with Bungie's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, another shooter that's turned a beloved single-player classic into a multiplayer-focused title. Last week, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bungie delayed&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, citing a need for extra development time to make the game shine.</p>

<p>Whether or not that happens to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, but for now, the game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/painkiller/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly gearing up to lay off more staff next week, in what would be the fourth round of major job cuts at Xbox in 18 months.</p>
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg</a>, which says that Xbox managerial staff are "expecting substantial cuts" across Microsoft's gaming arm.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Not yet clear how many people, but it's expected to be big," reporter Jason Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lseaakusns2s">Bluesky post</a> about the report. Bloomberg had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople">previously reported</a> that Microsoft was set to cut thousands of jobs next week, with its salespeople being the main folks affected.</p>
<p>The site notes that Microsoft declined to comment on this latest report.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been laying off staff en masse on a depressingly regular basis over the past couple of years, with 10,000 workers being let go in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, 1,900 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">January 2024</a>, and 650 in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">September 2024</a>. They also let go of around 6,000 people across the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">just last month</a>.</p>
<p>It's a frankly horrifying rate of contribution to the ever-deepening sea of layoffs that the games industry's been drowning in for the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">past few years</a>. A lot of it has come following Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-regulator-provisionally-approves-microsofts-activision-blizzard-buyout-following-ubisoft-deal">acquiring Activision Blizzard</a> – it’s the usual cost-cutting after a massive investment. That said, Microsoft aren’t exactly struggling on the money-making front. They <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">reported net income</a> of $25.8 billion for their most recent financial quarter.</p>
<p>Bloomberg notes that this latest round of Microsoft layoffs would come just before the company rolls into a new financial year after June 30. Is it cool to chuck human beings out of their livelihoods just to make a spreadsheet look a bit tidier?? No, but sadly it keeps happening.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-staff-yet-again-with-substantial-cuts-expected-at-xbox]]></content:encoded>

It was a game that was built from depths: depths of skill, knowledge, intelligence and narrative. It remains exactly as brilliant today as it was a quarter of a century ago.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196742,196049" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In fact, it works better today than it did ten years back.

A decade ago, doing this required installing a handful of different mods, and there was no way to actually play it in its vanilla version. And right away, I was pulled back in, crazy clip-cloppy footstep sound effects and everything. I feel ready to yet again dive back into this world of overlapping conspiracies, deep philosophy, and juggled morality.</p><figure id="" data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-recommend-id="image://5694b9bf4044cd9c414ad680a8f66871" data-format="jpg" data-width="1741" data-height="980" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="JC orders a drink at a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> so special?

It’s a combination of so many factors coming together so superbly, with a dream team of developers, financial backing, an exquisitely good story, and a complete lack of expectation from its future audience.</p><p>In 1996, when the economy was booming in preparation for the colossal bursting of the dot-com bubble, John Romero and Tom Hall, flush with success from id Software and its massive gaming series <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>, set out to create a new Texan developer: Ion Storm. Together, they spent lavishly, fought explosively, and created two compellingly dreadful games. First was <em>Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3</em>, and then the infamously disastrous FPS <em>Daikatana</em>. However, alongside all this, former Looking Glass (<em>Thief</em>, <em>System Shock</em>) developer Warren Ellis had been asked to create a parallel studio, Ion Storm Austin.</p><p>Distinct from Romero’s Dallas studio, Ellis had creative freedom and a pool of money, and quickly hired talent he knew from his days at Looking Glass, including Harvey Smith (<em>Dishonored</em>). In just 28 months, a tiny team of 20 pulled together (albeit with production troubles, serious frustrations, and “knock-down drag-out fights”) one of the most immersive, intricate games the world has ever known.</p><figure id="" data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-recommend-id="image://ae4760c5d4af9db9fdc5cf468d3e0c52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoilers!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the original <em>Deus Ex</em>, before its unfairly maligned Xbox-led sequel and its goth-eyed post-2010 prequels, you play as JC Denton, a cybernetically augmented human who works for a government agency called UNATCO. He discovers his brother Paul is working for a terrorist organization, the NSF, all amidst a global pandemic called the Grey Death. Very quickly, your assumptions about good and bad, right and wrong, are questioned, and you’re drawn into an intricate web of conspiracies and conflicting alliances.</p><p>This plays out...kinda how you want it to! There’s obviously a core, unavoidable plot, but how you approach it will dramatically affect the story you allow yourself to be told. It can be an ultra-violent FPS, where you blast through enemies with rockets and explosives, or a super-spy sim as you assassinate opponents, or you can be an unseen stealth pacifist, determined to kill no one, relying entirely on tranquilizers and stun guns. Every mission can be approached in multiple fashions, from spectacularly smashing through the roof of a building for an all-out gun fight, to slipping in through the vents such that no one ever knew you were there.</p><figure id="" data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-recommend-id="image://6472ff76f78891a75cf72bb2f1267753" data-format="jpg" data-width="2002" data-height="1127" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gunter with his mad red eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve told this anecdote too many times before, so apologies, but it captures the essence of what makes <em>Deus Ex</em> quite so extraordinary: At the time of its 2000 release, I was writing for the UK version of <em>PC Gamer</em>, where the reviews editor was one Kieron Gillen (now best known for his comics work, but once my colleague at <em>RPS</em>). Gillen had played the game for his world-class review (I’d link to it, but Future Publishing treats people’s efforts to archive its magazines with hostility—instead I’m copying out of my physical edition), which contained the words:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Games—like most other forms of entertainment—have a terrible habit of making you less than you are normally, simplifying you into a stripped-down cartoon...<em>Deus Ex</em> is one of the few games that succeeds in making you more than you are. Because <em>Deus Ex</em>’s universe is, obviously, reduced, you feel as if you have more freedom than you do in reality, which, like <em>Fight Club </em>for example, reminds you of your own freedom in reality. It’s a slap in the face, it reminds us how good videoart can be. And this <em>is</em> art. It’s beautiful. And I’m going to stop now before I start to cry...</p></blockquote><p>I was playing it soon after, and occasionally calling Kieron to chat about what was happening. On one call I said to him, “I couldn’t believe it when my brother died.”</p><p>“My brother didn’t die!” Kieron responded in bemusement. And then we both had a moment in silence, realizing that this game was offering even more than we’d already thought.</p><p><em>Deus Ex </em>was a game in which the finest details rung with intelligence, in which every book you found contained provocative ideas or conflicting philosophies, in which characters responded to you in subtly different ways depending upon how you were playing the game; on this micro level it felt malleable and responsive to you and how you reacted to it. But to discover that it was also offering the same flexibility to massive story beats was just mindblowing.</p><figure id="" data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eidos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-recommend-id="image://0517da25ace10a826de274bd8d8cefbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large stone hand reaching over a globe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s influence on the industry is impossible to overstate. While the circumstances and relative creative freedom afforded to its development are extremely hard to come by twenty-five years on, you can see the game’s DNA in so many of the games we love today. Even beyond the more obvious, all the immersive sims born in its shadow (<em>BioShock</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Prey...</em>), so many developers cite <em>Deus Ex</em> as a major source. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s quest director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz named <em>Deus Ex</em> when asked for his main inspirations. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-quest-director-says-deus-ex-was-a-big-inspiration-and-not-just-the-sunglasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> he said,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This one had a great impact on me as a developer and player back when I played it for the first time many years ago. And what I really liked about that game was completing the missions in many ways. It was not only based on dialogue decisions, since you also had the things that were on the map and its different points of entry that allowed you to get into buildings, as well as elements that opened different paths in history.</p></blockquote><p>But most importantly, it’s still a hell of a game to play today. Sure, its art is a bit crummy—it was criticized for this when it was released! God, those wall textures. But it matters so very, very little once you’re deep in its story, learning what it has to teach, reacting against what you find abhorrent, embracing what draws you in. (I’ll never forget my moment of pure horror when, working as a youth worker as I also was during the game’s release, one of the teenagers told me how furious he was about being forced to leave UNATCO, as to him they were clearly the good guys. Uh-oh.) </p><p>It’s currently just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.49 on GOG</a></span> (although it often comes down to a lot less than that on both GOG and Steam), and if you’ve never played it, then prepare to have your life properly, actually changed.</p><p>Happy birthday, <em>Deus Ex</em>! Thanks for changing my life too.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985]]></content:encoded>

The AI disclaimer is also no longer on its Steam page.</p><p>The use of generative AI is currently a very hot topic in the video game industry. It has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">used by studios like Activision</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">developers like Masahiro Sakurai</a> believe it has uses in game development. Generally, players don't like when generative AI is used in games, though, with this Jurassic World Evolution 3 backlash simply being the latest example.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21.</p>

Today, we learned players will make their return trip to Purgatory on October 9.&nbsp;</p><p>While the original Painkiller was created by Outriders/Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly, this modern reimagining – simply titled Painkiller – is made by Anshar Studios and published by 3D Realms. Despite the change in creators, the new game shares thematic similarities with its predecessor. Players are trapped in Purgatory and must fight their way out to prevent the fallen angel, Azazel, from invading Earth. Instead of controlling a single protagonist, however, the first-person shooter lets players select from four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch, each with distinct traits.&nbsp;</p><p>Painkiller can be played alone, but it also features three-player online co-op. In addition to blasting apart demons with a variety of supernaturally-enhanced firearms (both classic and new), you can upgrade abilities using tarot cards.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Painkiller will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 9. A Standard Edition of the game costs $39.99, and pre-ordering it earns you the Iron Crusade skin pack for characters and weapons. A Deluxe Edition runs for $49.99 and includes the skin pack plus three post-launch DLCs that will include additional character/weapon skins.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/the-painkiller-reboot-gets-an-october-launch-date]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

		<p>Rebellion and Liberty Films have released a set of four stills, giving a first look at the upoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rogue-trooper">Rogue Trooper</a> movie adaptation from Duncan Jones.</p>
<div id="attachment_461224"><p id="caption-attachment-461224">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p>

</div>
<p>Written and directed by Jones – best known for Moon, Source Code, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/26/is-warcraft-the-videogame-movie-weve-all-been-waiting-for/">Warcraft</a> and Mute – Rogue Trooper adapts the cult 2000AD comic book for the big screen, a story that was previously adapted to video games in the mid-noughties (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/rogue-trooper-redux-review/">remastered in 2017</a>). The film stars Aneurin Barnard (The Goldfinch, Dunkirk) as the Rogue Trooper, and Jemaine Clement (Avatar 2: The Way of Water) and Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows) as battleground looters Mr Brass and Mr Bland.</p>
<div id="attachment_461225"><p id="caption-attachment-461225">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>They’ve all donned full motion capture suits for the movie, which is fully CGI, similar to Jones’ Warcraft movie, or the predominantly CG Avatar films. Filming was completed last year using head mounted cameras for performance capture, while imagery and animation partner Treehouse Digital has been feeding all of that into Unreal Engine 5, before Liberty Films then add their own VFX and animation on top.</p>

<div id="attachment_461222"><p id="caption-attachment-461222">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>The other still shots give a look at a huge war vehicle on Nu Earth, which is the location of the battle between the Norts and Southers, and we get to see some Souther soldiers who are lost in the toxic wasteland of battle.</p>
<div id="attachment_461221"><p id="caption-attachment-461221">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>Producer Stuart Fenegan said, “We are so excited to share a first look of the film and show the amazing fidelity with which the team have used our actors on set performances to drive the animated characters. That level of detail and nuance was a priority from day one.”</p>
<p>Duncan Jones, meanwhile, had this to say: “AHHHHHHHHHHHH! WE’RE ALMOST FINISHED! SEE YOU AT SDCC!!”</p>
<p>He’s going to be at San Diego Comic Con on 25th July for a fan meeting and signing of the Rogue Trooper hero image.</p>

			<p>Neverness to Everness, the open-world gacha RPG in development by Hotta Studio, looks to deliver the anime GTA fantasy that no one knew they wanted, judging from some recent footage.</p>
<p>The new footage was shared as part of a new Containment Test Preview livestream that provided a new look at some of the game's features and mechanics, such as the urban open-world, characters, traversal, and more. As if the urban setting wasn't enough to label the game as a sort of anime GTA, the developer shared during the livestream footage of one of the main playable characters stealing a car and becoming wanted by the police. While the disconnect between the character design and committing crimes is enormous, it's undeniable that there's something charming in seeing an anime GTA experience. Hopefully, the game will be as fun to play as it looks in this early footage.</p>

<p>Neverness to Everness was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">announced</a> almost one year ago by Hotta Studio, a Perfect World subsidiary that released Tower of Fantasy, another gacha RPG, a couple of years back, which failed to make a significant splash in the genre dominated by HoYoverse's games like Genshin Impact. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game will feature cel-shaded graphics like most games featuring Japanese anime aesthetics and will support advanced PC features like NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Reportedly Planning Big Layoffs Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-reportedly-planning-big-layoffs-next-week.1226964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which alleges that Xbox is planning what sound like sweeping layoffs across the company, shortly before the end of Microsoft's fiscal year.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jason Schreier</a>&nbsp;(who, in turn, cites "people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information"), the planned layoffs at Xbox are part of a "company-wide reorganization".</p>

<p>Schreier's report doesn't estimate how many employees will lose their jobs at Xbox, but he does say the cuts will be "substantial" and that they'll be made "across the entire [Xbox] group", so it sounds like every department has a chance to be affected by the layoffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=mLR1YWmq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=IvoQbyAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is planning layoffs across its entire division, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>As Schreier points out, this will be the fourth time Microsoft has engaged in layoffs across an eighteen-month period. Most recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go around 3% of its total employees</a>, with a Microsoft spokesperson then claiming the layoffs were to help the company achieve "success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>Prior to that, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">another wave of layoffs</a> took place at Microsoft in January. In both cases, Microsoft didn't disclose exactly how many employees lost their jobs, although they did do their employees the courtesy of revealing this information for layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september" rel="nofollow">put into effect in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>That's all in addition to almost 2,000 layoffs from the Xbox gaming workforce in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>. Of course, none of this stopped CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring an eye-watering payrise</a> in October, but then again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">t'was ever thus</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft hasn't officially confirmed this latest round of Xbox layoffs yet, and it didn't provide comment to Bloomberg either, so we don't officially know these cuts are going ahead. It's entirely possible Microsoft may never publicly announce the cuts, too.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see if Microsoft issues an official statement confirming Bloomberg's reported layoffs. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>If ever there was a game I didn't expect to spawn a horde of spiritual successors from startup companies of varying dubiety, that game was celebrated commie hangover simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. And yet here we are with yet another claimant to the dance floor, Pera Coda. In fairness, it takes inspiration from a lot more than just ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but Disco Elysium is mentioned rather prominently in the marketing.</p>
<p>Created by Falan, a Turkish team founded by three architecture students, Pera Coda is a timeloop story set in a "surreal", "neon-noir" Istanbul, in which you play an attorney, Deniz, who is navigating a purgatory inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">Bardo in Buddhism</a>. The city is described as "both a stage and a mirror, where East meets West, chaos meets calm, and each district reflects a piece of your fragmented self." Certainly sounds quite Revacholian. Here's a teaser trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Combat there is none: instead, you'll solve point-and-click puzzles and make use of a "masking" mechanic, which lets you resculpt Deniz's memories and alter certain objects in ways that persist across loops. The investor pitchdeck I've been sent compares the puzzling to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/12-minutes">12 Minutes</a>. Another comparison that springs to my mind is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a>. </p>
<p>The Falan devs have posted a few concept videos of the game on social media, ahead of today's announcements. It's seemingly thanks to the popularity of those early videos that they've now partnered up with Elyzio, a company founded in 2022 by former Ubisoft technical director Anas El Ferachi and Google gaming consultant Dogan Can Yeginer. You might know Elyzio as the publishers of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689640/Wardens_Will/">Warden's Will</a>, a movement shooter that earned a few thumbs-up from the Steam reviewerati. </p>
<p>Pera Coda's current development team under Elyzio includes game designer Cem Çelik, previously a junior designer at Crytek, technical director Arthur Trouslard, who has worked across Ubisoft, Sloclap and Don't Nod, and Mehmet Ali Şen, formerly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultic">Cultic</a>, whose past credits include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360390/Cats_and_the_Other_Lives/">Cats And The Other Lives</a>.</p>
<p>Very much speaking as a clueless Anglo European tourist, the thing I find most interesting about Pera Coda is the city, which is "grounded in real iconic buildings and neighbourhoods", but is punctured by hallucinations. I would also like to hear more of the game's interpretation of Bardo, about which I am also clueless. Here are some screens.</p>

<p>If you prefer your Disco Elysulikes to be developed by people who worked (in whatever capacity) on Disco Elysium, may I refer you to the three direct heirs - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-psychogeography-est-of-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-is-a-gonzo-journalism-rpg-named-hopetown">Hopetown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">XXX Nightshift</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">whatever they're making at Summer Eternal</a>. All three were announced within hours of each other, producing what Nic called "an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases".</p>
<p>The rush continues with games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">Esoteric Ebb</a>. There are also a bunch of smaller Disco Elysuals on <a href="https://itch.io/c/5746476/disco-elysium">Itch.io</a>. I realise I'm probably doing some or all of these projects a disservice by framing them as Disco Elysium follow-ups, but it does feel a bit mad. Rumour has it that the pigeon currently trapped in your office is also making a Disco Elysium successor in collaboration with Tencent, based on the five minutes it once spent shitting on a ZA/UM staffer's sandwich. Personally, I'm reserving my pennies for the dawning of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>-like trend.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-has-yet-another-heir-in-pera-coda-a-turkish-timeloop-rpg-set-in-a-dreamlike-version-of-istanbul]]></content:encoded>

Managers are apparently expecting “substantial cuts” across Xbox, though it’s not yet clear which teams or studios might be hit hardest. This comes as Microsoft is already in the midst of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laying off thousands</a></span> across its sales departments. </p><p>The recent bloodletting began at Microsoft in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">January 2024 with nearly 2,000 layoffs</a></span> across Bethesda, Xbox, and Activision Blizzard. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-arkane-evil-within-3-prey-2-layoffs-1851461099">Studio closures</a></span> at Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin, and others followed in May. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-activision-blizzard-phil-spencer-microsoft-1851646757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-activision-blizzard-phil-spencer-microsoft-1851646757">Another 650 layoffs</a></span> occurred in September. While Microsoft claimed that no games were canceled in that most recent round of layoffs, developers at studios like <em>State of Decay 3</em> maker Undead Labs were impacted.</p><p>The ongoing cuts come at the tail end of an acquisition spree that culminated in buying <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker Activision Blizzard for $70 billion. The Xbox portfolio now constitutes the biggest gaming content publisher in the world, but at the cost of greater scrutiny and revenue expectations. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who usually prefers to talk about his favorite new games, has deflected blowback for the cuts over the last year by reiterating his responsibility to keep Xbox profitable. </p><p>  “Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest earlier this month</a></span> right after Xbox’s big summer showcase. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are.”</p><p>The result has been not only bringing major first-party games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5, but also raising prices. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be the company’s first $80 game this fall, and the price of the Xbox Series X/S recently spiked due to new tariffs amid Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. It feels like only a matter of time before Game Pass Ultimate, currently $20 a month, also goes up in price again.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-prices-layoffs-next-gen-hardware-ps5-1851784992]]></content:encoded>
