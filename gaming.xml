They also say that the dock is rated for 60W and the Switch 2 itself is rated for 45W, both much higher than the model that launched back in 2017. And finally, the dock has two USB-A ports and one for USB-C, presumably the one that powers it, which is the same as the current model. </p><p>“I spoke with [NextHandheld], and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit,” wrote<em> The Verge</em>’s Seaon Hollister. </p><p>Whether it ends up being 100 percent accurate or not, everything shared by the latest alleged Reddit leaker continues to line up with the rest of what we’ve been hearing, as well as with alleged <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">CAD mockups of what the Switch 2 looks like</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which circulated back in the fall</a></span>. Basically, the Switch 2 will look a lot like the current Switch, just slightly bigger, with a more rounded profile and a number of spec upgrades and design tweaks to improve handling and quality of life. </p><p>That’s not surprising in the context of the rest of the gaming hardware market. The Xbox Series X/S were not a major departure from the Xbox One. The PlayStation 5 is basically just a much more powerful PS4 with two ugly white fins. No one expects the Steam Deck 2 to look dramatically different than the existing one, and most PC gaming handhelds at this point all basically look the same: like a thick tablet with controllers on the sides. </p><p>But it is surprising given Nintendo’s own history of constantly trying to innovate in spaces where no one else is working. The company clung to cartridges longer than anyone and now uses SD cards. The Wii chased motion controls instead of HD graphics. The Wii U prioritized a second screen instead of beefier specs. And the Switch used smartphone specs to take gaming on the go. The notion of the company just iterating on the existing Switch, already the second most popular gaming console ever and fast closing in on the number one PS2, both made a ton of sense and seemed like it might still be too un-Nintendo to be real. </p><p>As we approach an eventual reveal of the Switch 2, every new potential leak points to Nintendo surprising fans by <em>not</em> doing the unexpected and instead doubling down on what already works. The only official thing we know about the upcoming hardware—that it will be backwards compatible with existing Switch games—only reinforces that seeming inevitability. </p><p>I’m sure the company might still have a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve. We’ll find out for sure whenever Nintendo actually announces the dang thing. It’s promised to do so before April 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to multiple sources, the owner canceled the deal to pick up wide receiver Jerry Jeudy because the player had a low rating in <em>Madden</em>. Jeudy would be picked up by the Cleveland Browns and had a fantastic season. </p><p>The outlet reports that this isn’t the only time Johnson has relied on <em>Madden</em> when making decisions. The Jets owner pushed back on the team signing free-agent John Simpson due to his low “Awareness” rating in EA’s sports sim.

<p>Counter-Strike is already the biggest multiplayer game in the world, and a mobile version would be a total game changer. As big as the PC gaming industry is, the mobile gaming industry is that much bigger with the amount of phones out there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-on-mobile">Is Counter-Strike on Mobile?</h2>



<p>There is no official version of Counter-Strike available on mobile. Other first person shooters have stepped into the mobile space though. Call of Duty Mobile is one of the most popular and highest grossing mobile shooters ever. Riot plans to eventually launch their tactical shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-mobile-china-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT on mobile</a>, and Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">working on a mobile version of Rainbow Six Siege</a>.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike is technically playable on phones through apps that can stream Steam to mobile devices, but if it does work, it won’t be well optimized. The closest thing to CS2 on mobile is playing it on Steam Deck, but the game is not Steam Deck Verified. While it’s not impossible for Counter-Strike to eventually reach phones, it’s extremely unlikely, as Valve has never prioritized mobile game development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a mobile game like Counter-Strike though, there’s plenty to choose from.</p>



<h2 id="h-mobile-games-like-counter-strike">Mobile Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>Just by searching “Counter-Strike” on the iOS or Apple app store, you’ll see tons of games clearly trying to emulate the iconic first person shooter. Even the names of the games are trying to capitalize on the popularity of CS: Critical Strike, Modern Strike Online, Critical Ops, Counter Attack. All of these games advertise CS-like tactical gameplay and weapon skins, and many of these games have just ported over nearly exact copies of iconic maps.</p>



<p>Top-down camera versions like Bullet Echo are also similar to Counter-Strike, but offer a different perspective. Both Call of Duty Mobile and Arena Breakout are also really good, popular mobile shooter games. However they’re more similar to arcade-like action shooters than tactical shooters. As mentioned above, both VALORANT and Siege are eventually making their way to mobile, but not for some time.</p>



<p>Do any of these mobile copies of Counter-Strike interest you?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

But one detail did catch some viewers off guard: The silver-haired witcher featured in the new trailer wasn't the iconic Geralt of Rivia, it was his adoptive, Ciri.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, players took to the internet to share their thoughts. Although CDPR doesn't care much for the opinions of players who are simply upset about the fact that the upcoming game's main character is both female and fully clothed, the devs do have a message for genuine fans of the franchise who say they're going to miss playing as Geralt.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1980538136" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Witcher games Geralt was the protagonist, and I think everyone really loved playing as Geralt," Narrative director Phillip Weber said in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interview-cd-projekt-red-wants-the-witcher-4-to-be-a-deeper-open-world-not-just-a-larger-one/" rel="nofollow ">a recent interview</a>. "I really loved playing as Geralt, so I think we're aware that if some people think right now that they would still prefer to be Geralt, I do think that’s a legitimate concern, so if this is where that concern [about Ciri] is coming from, that's valid."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, The Witcher 4 won't be the first time players step into Ciri's boots--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher 3</a> saw players alternate between playing as Geralt and playing as Ciri, though Geralt was still the main focus of the game. This time around, it seems the story will be told primarily through Ciri's eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ciri was already being set up as a second protagonist in the Andrzej Sapkowski novels and as the second playable character in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so for us, it really was the natural evolution of what we've already been making for so long," Weber continued. "Also, for people who really love Geralt, it lets us honour the ending that Geralt had in The Witcher 3 and in Blood and Wine."</p><p dir="ltr">Weber also added that the choice to make Ciri the game's main playable protagonist wasn't one that was made lightly, nor was it made recently.</p><p dir="ltr">"The best thing that we can do--and I think this is really our goal--is to prove that with Ciri, we can do a lot of interesting things so we can really make it worth it, because this decision to have Ciri as a protagonist wasn't made yesterday, we started making this [choice] a very long time ago," Weber explained.</p><p>CDPR hasn't announced an official release date for The Witcher 4, and has yet to reveal which platforms the game will launch on, though the studio has, dating back to The Witcher 3, launched games on both console and PC.

There are several <em>rogue </em>characters from the <em>Sonic</em> universe <em>aiming</em> for their <em>silver</em> screen debut. (See what I did there?)

We’re expecting it to be the Steam button equipped Legion Go S that leaker Evan Blass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">revealed last week</a>.</p><p>Why do I say that? The January 7th event, titled “Lenovo Legion x AMD: The Future of Gaming Handhelds,” will feature a special guest: Valve SteamOS and Steam Deck co-designer Pierre-Loup Griffais. Lenovo and AMD are calling him Valve’s “Chief Design Architect” for purposes of this event. </p><p>(Most Valve employees are simply considered designers internally, since they fluidly switch between teams and tasks; I believe Griffais once told me he prefers the same, but it’s true he’s also been one of the few public faces of SteamOS and the Steam Deck. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">It’s a fascinating company</a>.)</p><p>Griffais won’t be the only intriguing choice of panelist on stage: Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem will also be in attendance. He's now being introduced as Microsoft’s “VP of Next Generation."</p><div><p>We exclusively shared with you last week that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320607/lenovo-legion-go-8-leak-gamepad"> Lenovo will revamp its larger, seemingly Windows-based Legion Go with detachable controllers</a>, too. And we’re also expecting Lenovo to hedge its bets with a Windows version of the smaller Legion Go S based on those same leaks. It's a reasonable bet some, if not all of these devices will come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">with AMD’s yet-to-be-detailed Z2 Extreme chips.</a></p></div><div><figcaption>A leaked image of Lenovo’s bigger Legion Go, now with seemingly more ergonomic grips and possibly an OLED panel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image via <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">Evan Blass</a></cite></p></div><p>Here’s the full description of the event: </p><div><blockquote><p>Join us for a cocktail reception hosted by Lenovo Legion and AMD gaming leaders, with special guests Valve and other gaming industry giants.

                <p>Star Wars: Battlefront II's best and most complete version is currently free to keep on Xbox, but only for a limited time and only for EA Play members. Now through December 20, EA Play members can grab the 2017 game for the nice price of $0.00. EA Play is included with Game Pass Ultimate, so those subscribers get the game free as well.</p><p>The version of Battlefront II that's free is the Celebration Edition, which includes the base game and all past free updates. It has almost all of the content that was previously sold as DLC and microtransactions, so you're getting pretty much the complete package.</p><p>The Celebration Edition originally launched in December 2019 priced at $40, following on from the standard edition's debut in 2017. If you're not an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate member, you can still get the Celebration Edition for a great price, as it's currently marked down to only $4.</p><p>Battlefront II had a challenging launch in 2017, as the game's early-access debut was criticized for its use of loot boxes. EA removed these in time for the game's public launch, though, and the game steadily grew and improved with new maps and modes over the years.</p><p>The new Battlefront games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell more than 35 million copies</a>, but EA was said to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">rejected a pitch from DICE for a third game</a> due to licensing costs. While the modern Battlefront series didn't continue, the classic Battlefront games were re-released earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-review-fire-away/1900-6418207/" data-ref-id="1900-6418207">to a poor critical reception.</a></p><p>After Battlefront II, DICE would go on to release Battlefield V in 2018 and Battlefield 2042 in 2021. DICE is now working with a network of other studios on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">the next Battlefield</a>, which returns to a modern-day setting and is reportedly on tap to launch in October 2025.</p><p>As for the Star Wars video game series, some of the upcoming games include Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream and the next Star Wars Jedi game from Respawn, among others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24324936/xbox-elite-series-2-series-x-s-wireless-controller-astro-bot-ps5-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the holiday season in full effect, you can expect a fresh stream of Christmas noobs entering your multiplayer lobbies. If you’re on an Xbox or PC and looking to keep the pressure on during ruthless initiation rites, the <strong>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Gaming Controller</strong> can help maximize your effectiveness. It’s usually a pricey spend at $179.99, but you can get the full kit with its extra back buttons, analog stick toppers, D-pads, and wireless charging dock for just $124 ($56 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5PX3XU5SUY6H">Walmart</a> right now, which is a new record low price. </p><p>For comparison’s sake, the Elite Series 2 Core includes none of those extras, save for the tool that lets you adjust the analog stick’s tension. The Core is appropriately cheaper as a result and starts around $94.99 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/8li1q4bsmj1v4">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-elite-core-wireless-controller-red%2F-%2FA-88533778">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> right now. While you can <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack">buy the components separately for $59.99</a>, the two combined turn out to be more expensive than buying the full Elite Series 2 package. That said, it’s a viable way to get the full experience with the Core’s exclusive red, blue, and white color options.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 — usable on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows — offers the most customizability of any first-party pro-style controller and is still one of the most configurable options from any brand. In addition to hot-swappable D-pads and four removable back buttons, you can swap the analog stick tops and adjust their tension. The triggers support three different stop levels. You’ll also get extensive software-based button remapping through Xbox and Windows, but you can’t make changes on the controller itself. And the controller doesn’t use removable batteries like the official standard controllers, meaning you can’t swap in a fresh set if their capacity shrinks over time. But Microsoft says it’ll last up to 40 hours before you need to recharge, and you have convenient charging options between its USB-C cable and the included dock.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Read our Xbox Elite Series 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>If the price of the Xbox Elite Series 2 is more than you want to pay for a fresh gamepad, the standard <strong>Xbox Series X/S Wireless Controller</strong> is also on sale at <a href="https://howl.link/2idmxf1dyvd5a">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F-%2FA-80744785">Target</a> in white for $34.99 ($25 off), which is an all-time low price. It has no customization options outside of the remappable buttons that you can set up in Xbox and Windows, but it still offers Microsoft’s beloved ergonomics and the advantage of user-replaceable batteries — whether you go for a pair of AAs or an endless sea of rechargeable options.</li><li>If you’re partial to Roku’s incredibly easy user experience, the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> can be a nice alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details">Apple TV 4K</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a> — and the $29.99 sale price ($20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/fj8phdsqxie9l">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-with-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600">Target</a> is a good value. Compared to the older <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase">Streaming Stick Plus</a>, the 4K model offers a bit more speed for zipping around apps and now supports Dolby Vision to go along with HDR10 Plus. It doesn’t have Wi-Fi 6 or Dolby Atmos like the pricier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252484/roku-ultra-2024-features-specs-price">Roku Ultra</a>, but it still supports basic surround sound codecs. It also comes with a great voice remote that has a headphone jack and shortcuts to popular streaming apps. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><em><strong>Astro Bot</strong></em> for PlayStation 5 recently won game of the year at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">The Video Game Awards</a>, so we understand any sudden thirst you may have to play it. Thankfully, the physical copy is still discounted to its record low of $49.97 (about $10 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/xoocciv9xc6uh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fastro-bot---playstation-5%2F409781.html">GameStop</a> right now. We thought the platforming puzzle game had system-selling, game-of-the-year-worthy appeal well before the votes were tallied. That’s because of its charming new mascot and supporting cast, imaginative gameplay and aesthetic, and an increasingly rare and intangible sense of magic and joy that got so many of us hooked on gaming in the hobby’s earliest years. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Open that bottle of space champagne, the aliens have been wiped out. At least that's what the interstellar pilots of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4476110736154691200">landed in the Sol system</a>, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.</p>

<p>"The war is over," say Frontier. "We vanquished the enemy at our doorstep and now is the time to rebuild." Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_OZXIEcq9Q">a recording of the Titan finally being blown to bits</a>, courtesy of player Ricardo, who recorded the final event while sitting in his ship watching the ET's last moments. Titans are the biggest alien vessel in the game, massive capital ships certainly capable of eating a planet or two. When they were first discovered, hiding in the maelstrom clouds after a game update, they were found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-going-to-like-whats-inside-elite-dangerous-thargoid-maelstrom-clouds">scary and noisy</a>. "Like an orchestra of alien tubas gargling mouthwash," said Katharine. </p>
<p>The asplosion comes just two weeks after the ships <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/galnet/titan-cocijo-devastates-sol-system">showed up in Sol</a>, on December 5th. Titans are fought by bombing them to kingdom come. This means earth defenders had to load out their ships with some swish sci-fi gear. They needed "caustic sinks" to negate the hull-eating effects of a cloud of horrible space gas the alien exudes. They had to fit a "pulse neutraliser" to nullify the angry waves of painful gravity the aliens pump out. And they required rack after rack of missiles to rain down upon the monster when they finally did manage to get close, aiming (like all good trench runs) for the thermal vents on the alien's hull. All this while avoiding Thargoid interceptor ships, dodging the mines laid in the hideous caustic cloud, and escaping from a burst of blue energy the Titan unleashes when it feels most vulnerable.</p><p>Say what you like about the dry space trucking of the sim, this is excellent sci-fi craic. Few video games can result in video guides as <a href="https://youtu.be/h0U5PTVMlGA?feature=shared&amp;t=490">satisfyingly dambusters as this</a>. Veteran players may also notice in that linked video that the pilot is sitting there with his engine idling at a low heat. That's because Commanders <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/359320/discussions/0/595135660380133228/">were advised</a> to keep their thermal levels low if they wanted to watch the fireworks - so they wouldn't be noticed by any of the Titan's last protective fighter vessels. A successful bombing run netted players millions of credits in payment for an alien well-whacked. And now that the Titan lies in pieces, even pilots who avoid combat can go and scavenge the wreckage for Thargoid components worth a few hundred thousand credits. </p>
<p>Developers Frontier have also celebrated the victory with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/508441373248061525">a post on Steam</a>, calling it an "epilogue" to the Thargoid saga. But they haven't said what's next for the aliens. Does this mean we won't see any more Titans appearing in the galaxy? Or does it just mean the threat to Earth is over? Smaller Thargoid vessels are still around to mop up, it seems, and we're not told yet if they're planning to remove those or leave them around. </p>
<p>The Thargoids have had a fun history in the game when you pile it all up. The possibility of alien life beyond bacteria was first teased in early 2016 when players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-aliens-barnacles">strange barnacles</a> on the surface of planets. Players soon started to discover <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-threat-teased-in-elite-dangerous-distress-calls">spooky distress signals</a> hinting at further dangers from beyond known space. "Oh my gods, it can't be," read one of the ill-fated messages. "These things are a myth... That noise..." Soon enough players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-pilots-finally-find-a-crashed-alien-spaceship">crashed remains</a> of extraterrestrials. Then pilots started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-thargoid-encounter">pulled out of warp</a> by huge Thargoid scout ships, who would disable their vessel, scan them with sinister intent, and warp away. </p>
<p>Eventually, the aliens attacked. Almost two years after the first signs of aggressive alien life appeared, an update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-alien-swarm-thargoids">brought combat encounters</a> with the Thargoids to the sim. They've been around in some form or another ever since, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-just-got-invaded-by-thargoids">amping up their attacks on human space</a> significantly in 2022. Now, this seems to be putting a bookend on the aliens as the big bad guy.</p><p>Elite Dangerous itself is ten years old this year, which does make me curious about what's next on the agenda. Other games might have seen a sequel by now, but I'm not sure what a sequel would achieve that more expansions and continued support could not. I guess we'll see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-counter-strike/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There are dozens of games that want to emulate or be like Counter-Strike. The iconic first person shooter from Valve is successful because of its simplicity, which opens the door for other games to try to alter that formula. While some have just downright copied Counter-Strike, others have added enough to stand out successfully.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best games like CS out there right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-games-like-counter-strike">Best Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>There are a number of games that can be classified as tactical shooters. However, there are really only two successful and popular games in the genre that are truly like CS.</p>



<h3 id="h-valorant">VALORANT</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ first person tactical shooter takes a lot of inspiration from Counter-Strike. Many of the leaders on the VALORANT development team, including former CS:GO map designer Salvatore Garozzo, <a href="https://www.redbull.com/se-en/history-of-valorant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally came from Valve</a>. The core gameplay for VALORANT is the same as Counter-Strike, but what sets the games apart are VALORANT’s agents.</p>



<p>VALORANT features over 20 different agents with their own unique ability set, which effectively replaces the traditional grenades used in Counter-Strike. Just like with weapons and armor, players have to purchase charges of their abilities if used in the round prior. Like Counter-Strike, VALORANT has purchasable weapon skins and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thriving esports scene</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege is like a much more advanced and intricate version of Counter-Strike. Like VALORANT, players adopt special characters (called Operators), each with a unique set of gadgets and specific weapon choices. There’s no “purchasing” gear between rounds, but the planting and defusing objectives are still the same.</p>



<p>What makes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-more-money-ubisoft-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege special</a> is all the added gameplay elements. The maps feature and encourage environmental destruction, and there’s a robust camera/drone system that lets players map out precise enemy locations.</p>



<p>There’s no shortage of larger-scale, military-sim tactical shooters available to play as well, like <strong>Delta Force, Arma 3, </strong>and <strong>Squad</strong>. Additionally, as of December 2014, Fortnite has jumped into the tactical shooter genre with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-ballistic-esports-operating-model/">the release of Ballistic Mode</a>, which is very inspired by Counter-Strike.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/superman-movie-james-gunn-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every time I look at the news I’m greeted by an unending clown car of bad behavior and cynicism. If it isn’t <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/fani-willis-georgia-trump-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public servants being penalized for doing the right thing</a>, it’s the opposition party <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-playbook-beat-republicans-2-years-work-now/story?id=116846803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling over and giving up</a>. But, look… up in the sky.</p><p>Today the very first thing I saw when I got out of bed was the trailer for James Gunn’s upcoming <em>Superman</em> movie. It made me cry.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Superman | Official Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhUht6vAsMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I don’t know how or where I nursed my affection for Clark Kent and Lois Lane—it creeps up on me sometimes, and I find myself watching adaptations of the comics with a yearning in my heart that I struggle to describe. From the excellent <em>Superman: The Animated Series</em> from my youth to the more recent <em>My Adventures with Superman</em>, I have loved both sides of this character: the perpetually underestimated journalist trying his best to tell truth to power and the man with godlike abilities, sacrificing for the good of the world. (You’ll notice that I haven’t mentioned the more recent movie adaptations of this work. That is because that character just wasn’t present in those films.)</p><p>James Gunn’s take on Superman is, evidently, different from Zach Snyder’s interpretation in <em>Man of Steel</em> and <em>The Justice League</em>. The colors are bright and saturated; Superman saves people; the classic John Williams score from the 1978 movie rings out on electric guitar. Superhero movies have long tried to massage the goofier elements of comics out of the material. In the 2000 <em>X-Men</em> film, a character made a snide comment about “yellow spandex” in reference to the costumes from the comics. In so many films to follow, superhero characters forgo their code names because it just feels too weird to say “Scarlet Witch” or “Quicksilver” out loud.</p><p>Gunn’s trailer features no such embarrassment. In brief flashes, we see a fully bald Nicholas Hoult waggling his eyebrows as Lex Luther, as well as Hawkgirl—a comic book character infamous for being incredibly confusing and impossible to write <em>in the comics</em>—wearing her comics-accurate costume with the hawk head and wings. Nathan Fillion’s tough guy Green Lantern Guy Gardener has his classic bowl cut, and he looks gleefully stupid. Edi Gathegi wears the weird T-shaped mask of Mr. Terrific, the world’s smartest man (congrats to the costumers who figured out how to make that stay on his head). In the opening shot of the trailer, Superman himself cries out for Krypto, the super-dog, who obeys his master while wearing a little cape.</p><figure><figcaption>Superman/DC</figcaption></figure><p>These are the things that make people like Superman—a lack of cynicism opens your heart to hope. These elements haven’t been downplayed to make the character serious. They’ve been embraced, to help you remember how it feels to be a child whispering for Superman to save you, to remember that the world has not ended but is instead full of opportunity if we all rise to the occasion.</p><p>This movie might suck—bad movies have had good trailers before. But I think it is fine to have hope, to admit out loud that you want something good to happen. I don’t feel a lot of hope in my life these days. Sometimes, though, I find myself thinking of a story of Superman’s creation: Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster were two Jewish kids who loved science fiction. Jerry Siegel’s father was a tailor and owned a small store. In 1932, the store was robbed, and Siegel’s father died. His mother also died of a heart attack. Superman is a character who saves shop owners from robberies, who is always there when you need him most. Jerry Siegel could not save his father, but he gave us a story that can help us save ourselves.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames"><h3>A Wheezy Indiana Jones Is Incredibly Relatable</h3></a><p>'Always knew someday you’d come unlocking, opening then walking back through my door'</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in an <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8">investor release this week</a>, the cancelled game was known as Project 8 internally, and had 37 team members as of September 2024. For context, 11 bit studios currently have over 150 staff, according to their <a href="https://11bitstudios.recruitee.com/">recruitment site</a>. It began development in early 2018, with total development costs of about 48.4 million zloties  - around 9.4 million pounds or 11.8 million dollars - by this September.
</p>
<p>
"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting," 11 bit's president of the management board Przemysław Marszał observes in the release. "However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal."
</p>
<p>
Gloominess about the layoffs aside, I'm predictably both intrigued and worried that 11 bit think there's less interest now in games with a pronounced narrative component. Then again, the reasons for the cancellation aren't all macroeconomical. "With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks," Marszał went on. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued.
</p>
<p>
"While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations," he said. "Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew."
</p>
<p>
During the unannounced game's last project milestone review, Marszał explained, "our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project's overall profitability."
</p><p>
It's not yet clear how many people will be laid off thanks to the cancellation, as it'll be a "phased" reduction. Marszał did specify that "more than half" of the Project 8 team will "be offered opportunities to transition to other existing teams or to new, as-yet-unannounced initiatives". 
</p>
<p>
I wasn't aware 11 bit were working on a console-focussed game. Their recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enthused many reviewers, though our own Sin Vega was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">pretty mixed on it</a>, and her conclusions chime with my misgivings at the preview stage.</p>
<p>I'm also not entirely sure what to make of next year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, a fancy sci-fi yarn in which you play a castaway who clones himself in order to operate a rolling space base, and then has to deal with his proportionately-multiplied psychological baggage. I think it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">memorable</a>, whatever happens. In-house projects aside, 11 bit have also published some wonderful third-party creations, including acerbic religious fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> and fantasy reshelving sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'd have been interested to see Project 8, assuming it also shipped on PC. Best of luck to everybody affected by the cancellation. Hopefully this will be 2024's final <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoff</a> post. It's certainly been <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">a long year</a>, and not just for video game developers.
