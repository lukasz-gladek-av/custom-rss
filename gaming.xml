          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Prior to the official launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">Borderlands 4 preorders</a>, most of the questions were about how much the game was going to cost. But perhaps the questions players should have been asking were about the game's system requirements. Gearbox has disclosed the PC specs for Borderlands 4, and they're pretty eye-popping. But the requirements may not be as strict as they initially appear.</p><p>The specs were shared earlier today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Borderlands 4's Steam page</a>, and the stats are reproduced below.</p><p>Recommend:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 32 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Minimum:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Though it looks like there isn't much wiggle room for the storage, the 64-bit processor, and the 8 CPU Cores, there may be some for the processor and graphics chips. As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/borderlands-4-system-requirements-demand-8-cpu-cores-and-8-gb-of-vram-but-the-reality-is-probably-a-bit-more-forgiving-than-that/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, the minimum requirements would accept an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, which can't support ray tracing like the Nvidia RTX 2070. That suggests ray tracing support isn't necessary for the graphics chip. The outlet also suggests that the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X CPU should be good enough to run Borderlands 4, even though it isn't listed in the minimum specs. Both lists require SSD storage between 8-12 GB VRAM for the graphics.</p><p>Earlier this week, Gearbox disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">post-launch plans for Borderlands 4</a>, but if you want the new Vault Hunters then you'll have to pay for the $130 Super Deluxe Edition. It's currently unclear if Gearbox will sell the new additions as standalone DLC. There will also be additional storylines and side missions as well Bounty Packs that introduce new areas and missions that will lead to unique boss fights and the chance to earn more loot. Bounty Packs will be included with both the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> on September 12.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is launching a fourth battle royale mode with its June 18 update--Blitz Royale, a smaller scale version of BR with 32 players and rounds intended to last five minutes or less. While Epic Games is pushing Blitz Royale as being geared toward mobile players, the mode is playable on every platform Fortnite works on. Blitz Royale is available in solos and four-players squads, and is zero build only.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165"></a><figcaption>Blitz Royale will be Fortnite's quickest battle royale mode yet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg"></figure><p>So how does it work? Well, it's a no-builds version of battle royale on a much smaller map than the main Fortnite island. But this isn't a tiny version of regular Fortnite Battle Royale. All players will start each match with a boon and/or weapon--everybody in a given round will get the same item--and as they survive and eliminate enemy players, they'll increase their Blitz Level, which immediately grants more weapons and gear at each level.</p><p dir="ltr">The new mode is bringing some free cosmetics with it, including a new skin, the Blitz Knight. To unlock the Blitz Knight, you'll need to either gain 15 levels once Blitz Royale goes live, or place in the top ten in 20 different Blitz rounds. There's also, of course, a unique victory umbrella glider, the Blitz Brella, that you can earn by winning three Blitz matches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKYynyozO8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uKYynyozO8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Blitz Royale is not a permanent mode, at least not yet. Initially, the mode is set to last just for the next four weeks, and will go away on July 15. Though it's clear that Epic would like for Blitz Royale to stick around, they'll presumably want to see both how well it does and how it affects the player populations of the existing modes before committing long term.</p><p dir="ltr">While it'll only stick around for four weeks, each of those weeks will have a wildly different theme and loot pool. After launch week, Blitz Royale will be themed after Avatar: The Last Airbender for Week 2, which will bring back those bending scrolls that were introduced in Chapter 5 Season 2. Week 3 will be full of weapons from the main Battle Royale mode that were dropped from bosses, like Thorne's Vampiric Blade, and the TMNT-themed Week 4 will be all about punching folks, with a loot pool full of melee weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big week for Fortnite. In addition to Blitz Royale, the June 18 update includes a new Fortnite Festival Season <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bruno-mars-is-your-next-fortnite-festival-headliner/1100-6532488/" data-ref-id="1100-6532488">with Bruno Mars headlining</a>, and a permanent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expeditions-is-the-co-op-action-adventure-mode-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6532482/" data-ref-id="1100-6532482">new co-op Lego mode</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/xbox-and-amd-sign-a-new-multi-year-partnership-for-next-gen-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Xbox has announced a new “multi-year strategic partnership” with AMD, securing the chipmaker to develop the processors for the next-generation of Xbox devices, which will include consoles, PC, handheld and cloud gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>President of Xbox Sarah Bond announces the partnership and confirms that AMD will co-engineer silicon with Microsoft for a wide portfolio of devices, which does include the next-generation Xbox console.</p>
<p>This confirms that Microsoft is sticking around in the console-making business and will release a successor to the Xbox Series X|S to go up against the inevitable PlayStation 6.</p>
<p>Bond promises that this will enable “deeper visual quality, immersive gameplay, and AI-powered experiences”, as well as noting that the platforms and the ecosystems will “not tied to a single store or device, and fully compatible with your existing Xbox game library.”</p>

<p>This is largely a confirmation of the direction that Microsoft is heading in, following on from the announcements at Summer Game Fest. There Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/xbox-just-announced-their-first-ever-handhelds-the-rog-xbox-ally-and-ally-x/">ROG Ally X</a>, a new Windows PC handheld developed by Asus and with Xbox branding and integration. They also doubled down on Xbox Play Anywhere, a scheme in which you can purchase a game from Microsoft and play it across both Xbox consoles and Windows PC… except that they now brand this as Xbox PC to unify the approach.</p>
<p>Sticking with AMD makes an awful lot of sense. AMD’s CPUs are market leading on PC at the moment and their GPUs have made great strides with the most recent generation to catch up with Nvidia in areas like neural upscaling and ray tracing. Their work is continuing with <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/337062/amd-announces-fsr-4-updates-project-redstone">Project Redstone for the Radeon 9000 series</a>, though Microsoft is obviously privvy to behind-the-scenes work being done for future generations as well.</p>
<p>Similar to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft and AMD will co-develop future chipsets for Xbox consoles and devices – just as AMD and Sony co-develop the chips for PlayStation consoles in the last two generations. What this generally looks like is AMD providing the technology and Microsoft fine-tuning the configuration, potentially pushing to include certain key features that could be coming from future CPU and GPU technology, rolling it back into the fixed platform of a console.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft’s sticking around with a more traditional console, it sounds like, and it will be backward compatible. Good news!</p>

That combination of competitive relevance and collector appeal has already driven prices up, with several cards becoming some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today">most sought-after in the entire set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're opening boosters or tracking down singles, these are the 16 most valuable cards from the Through the Ages collection right now. They're powerful, flashy, and, for longtime fans of both games, pretty irresistible right now. Let's take a look.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>16. Clive Rosfield (Vial Smasher the Fierce)</strong></h3><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223058"><div id="223058" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive Rosfield - Vial Smasher the Fierce</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $10.20 market, you can get this Commander staple for as low as $9.60, but this shoots up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1MRn?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.89 for the foil print</a>. I was hoping for a larger red creature to represent Clive, but Vial Smasher fits his fiery personality well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>15. The Emperor, Hell Tyrant (Yawgmoth, Thran Physician)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223057"><div id="223057" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Emperor, Hell Tyrant - Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yawgmoth, Thran Physician is a Modern staple (there's a whole deck named after him), so the Emperor art would be a nice addition to die-hard fans of the deck. You can pick this up for around $14.54 market, or as low as <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnO3j?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$11.99 on TCGPlayer right now</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>14. Kefka's Tower (Bolas's Citadel)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223056"><div id="223056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka's Tower - Bolas's Citadel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought for sure Kefka's Tower would be printed onto Command Tower, but it looks like Wizards of the Coast wanted to avoid Commander-only cards, which is welcome. Get this at market value for $15.55 or as low as $13.69.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>13. Cecil Harvey (Tymna the Weaver)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223055"><div id="223055" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cecil Harvey - Tymna the Weaver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite (seriously, I adore Final Fantasy IV), Tymna, the Weaver's design is another card that fits the flavor of the character well. Find it at market around $16.18.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>12. Lightning, Lone Commando (Isshin, Two Heavens as One)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223054"><div id="223054" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Lone Commando v- Isshin, Two Heavens as One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Mardu Commanders around, Isshin definitely fits Lightning's vibe in terms of combat mechanics. You can pick this up at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62DYj?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market price for $21.93</a> but not much lower at the time of writing, as Lightning's value seems to be slowly spiking as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>11. Blessing of the Oracle (Akroma's Will)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223051"><div id="223051" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blessing of the Oracle - Akroma's Will</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing white in Commander, odds are you're running Akroma's Will. The art with Noctis and Lunafreya is one of my personal favorites. It's recently had a massive spike in price, and you can currently find it at market value for around $23.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Kefka Palazzo (Purphoros, God of the Forge)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223052"><div id="223052" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka Palazzo - Purphoros, God of the Force</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Purphoros, God of the Forge is great in Commander if you're running a tokens or blink strategy, and the Yoshitaka Amano Kefka art is a nostalgic masterpiece. Market is around $25, and that seems to be the price you're looking at right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth (Thrasios, Triton Hero)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223053"><div id="223053" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth - Thrasios, Triton Hero</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be hard-pressed to see Thrasios played anywhere other than low-powered Merfolk Commander decks, but the Final Fantasy X cover art is the big selling point here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-preview-proves-theres-room-for-more-than-just-mario-party<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lego seems to snap into yet another genre pretty seamlessly.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The humble party game genre has connected people throughout gaming generations. And while nobody really considers it whenever a new one hits the fray, the results are usually an enjoyable time. That’s true for Lego Party, the mini brick’s seemingly successful attempt to Lego-fy Mario Party so that fans of the tiny constructables can get together in a group of four and proceed to ruin their friendship over minigames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Mario Party</a> you know exactly what to expect for Lego Party. A group of four players will drop onto a boardgame-like table and roll numbers to advance the requisite number of spots. Some spots will have special prizes, some will hide traps that will steal your hard-earned Stars, or in this case, a golden Lego Brick. After every player rolls their turn, they’ll all drop in to compete in one of 60 Lego-themed minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And to Lego Party’s credit, the minigames is where this effort can differentiate itself from Mario Party. There are some standard-fare activities, like a game where players jump over a swinging octopus tentacle until the last player is left standing, to some very off-kilter ones. One I tried is a Bennett Foddy-style unicycle racing game where players must use the joysticks to balance atop a very fiddly unicycle and inch their way towards the finish line. We only played about eight minigames total, so I’m very excited to see what else Lego Party has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Lego innovation is how Lego Party leans into the creative aspect of the toy bricks. While the overworld maps are themed after fun concepts like “Pirates,” they can also be modified if certain conditions are met within the game. Landing on a specific spot will let players create unique elements to add to the map like a pirate ship that wasn’t there when the game began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Lego Party has the crisp, colorful aesthetic Lego games have come to be known for, though the party game aesthetic means that these Legos lean towards more whacky designs than something I’d consider charming. That is to say, these Legos are all about being zany and loud, which is perfect for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing with three other players (my two IGN colleagues and a developer), we found ourselves immediately sucked into its playful orbit. The goal is to collect as many Gold Bricks by the end of the game. Winning minigames on their own will only award you Lego bits that you can turn into ways to score Gold Bricks, such as movement modifiers that will help you land on the spot where a Gold Brick has spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’re also traps you can purchase (don’t worry, it’s not in a microtransaction way) to potentially steal Gold Bricks from other players, and unique spots on the board that will initiate a special 2v2 game where the winning team will both get Gold Bricks as a reward. These 2v2 rounds include special minigames where, for example, both players each control one half of a car and must coordinate their controls to drive to the designated goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we did complete a small game ourselves, we only saw a fraction of what Lego Party has to offer. If the rest of the games are anywhere near as fun as the handful that we played, I can see Lego Party having the kind of addictive appeal Mario Party has had – which is especially good news for PlayStation and Xbox players that don’t have access to Mario Party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress.1221123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A solid way to judge a co-op shooter is by how many inside jokes you and your mates come up with while you play. And after around seven hours working in The Oldest House, it’s safe to say that if that were the only metric to judge FBC: Firebreak on, it would be an easy 10. Of course, it helps that the setting and the enemies you face are so curiosity-inducing. So far, I’ve encountered a sticky note behemoth, an evil drum kit, and a possessed traffic light. I’ve also carved a path through pink goop and loaded mannequins into ski lifts. Do I understand why? No. Does it matter? Not at all. With slick combat, striking graphical effects and diverse objectives, FBC: Firebreak is a first-person shooter that’s a load of silly fun with your friends. The main question I’m still figuring out is: how far can Remedy sustain this wackiness to keep me interested in the long term?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is set six years after the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/26/control-review-2">Control</a>, and invites you back to the wonderfully strange architecture of The Oldest House under wildly different circumstances. Instead of saving the day as upstart director Jesse Faden, you’re a trio of first responders attending to oddball emergencies that would make an OSHA officer wince. When radioactive leeches have infested a quarry and need to be thrown into a furnace on wheels that resembles Team Fortress 2’s Payload, it’s you and your team that receive the call. And once you’ve finished your Jobsite shift, your team will also have to trek back to the elevator you arrived in and survive until it reaches your station. Hey, it’s hard work, but someone's gotta do it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak PC Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the time since Control, that game’s interdimensional antagonist, The Hiss, also remains ever-present. As such, while you’re trying to tackle the quirky jobs at hand, you’ll also need to manage hordes of possessed office employees hellbent on your disposal. While there hasn’t been a vast range of enemy types to tackle, at least so far, there is enough diversity to keep gunplay interesting. And, whether it was a glowing ghoul sprinting at me, or flying desk jockeys zooming through the sky, I found plenty of joy in taking them out all the same. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To pull off these expedition, you call in the help of two additional players, with each member of the squad wielding a specialised ‘Crisis Kit.’ Similar to the class systems found in other cooperative shooters, each kit equips you with a unique skill set that can expedite key tasks throughout jobs. For example, on the map called Hot Fix, the player wielding the Fix Kit can speedily repair the internals of a broken fan with their quick-fixing wrench, while the Splash Kit crew member can provide support by keeping them from heat death thanks to their globs of healing ammunition. Meanwhile, the Jump Kit player can sprint around activating the generators with their electro-kinetic charge impactor, using their secondary fire to rocket jump around the map and control the field. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s plenty of replayability in the current Jobsite lineup already.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth mentioning that there are no restrictions on repeating roles, and your crew can triple down on one skillset, rather than diversifying the team. You’ll still be able to finish jobs, though the approach you’ll need to take will be drastically different depending on the specific composition of your team. While the gunplay across each role is identical (depending on your choice of loadout), the mixture of your cohort's Crisis Kits do well to tailor expeditions around your team’s preferences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of how your team pick powers between the roles, though, FBC provides opportunities for each role to shine, especially as you start to level up and invest in the upgrade trees to unlock perk-based modifiers and new weaponry. As the resident Fix Kit operator and player most likely to get into sticky situations, I funnelled my Lost Assets (the currency that allows you to progress the upgrade tree) into perks like ‘Shower Thoughts’, which enabled me to expedite recovery when using healing sources, as well as ‘Greasy Fingers’, which allowed me to switch between my tools faster. While I was initially sceptical that these additions would make any tangible difference, I immediately noticed a positive change in my performance, especially during high-octane combat encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, FBC has five unique Jobsites to choose between, with more expected to arrive after launch. And, despite the small pool of options, there’s plenty of replayability in the current lineup already. The pink goo level, which my friends lovingly dubbed the Mr Blobby level in homage to the British children’s TV mascot from the early 90s, became the bane of our existence – primarily due to our clumsy play leading us right into explosives. The sentient sticky note-infested Paper Chase mission, on the other hand, provided the right amount of risk vs reward, and we revisited that map frequently in search of more Lost Assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Jobsite in FBC offers three unique ‘Clearance Levels’ that expand on the base job, and as you progress deeper into these levels, the number of Hiss agents and objective criteria increases in both number and intensity as the map expands. Soon enough, the infected office workers make way for winged eldritch horrors and tanky beasts, and your team will be forced to communicate to avoid being downed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some reprieve from the constant combat, and in each Clearance level, you can find healing decontamination showers and ammunition bays. Though in the FBC, not even safe zones are truly safe, and these life-saving stations can also break and falter, demanding a quick fix from a certain kit or a more lengthy button-pressing session if you’re caught in a bind. Attempting a repair without the appropriate kit in FBC leads to a rhythmic quick-time event where you have to tap Q and E (or L1 and R1) in sequence without making errors to progress the meter. I wasn’t expecting to encounter a stressful rhythm game in my cooperative shooter, but I was pleasantly surprised by how it ramped up the anxiety of completing essential tasks nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps what makes FBC so morish, though, is how quickly poor communication can turn a level upside down. During one such mission, I found myself caught between enemy fire and literal flames while attempting to retrieve Lost Assets. In response to my screams, my Splash Kit teammate valiantly came to my rescue, putting out the fire and starting to revive me… that was, until a second horde of Hiss appeared, and the fire restarted without warning. As you could expect, my teammate fell to the same fate I did while trying to revive me. At any point, I could have said, ‘Leave me, save yourself.’ But, naively, despite the flames and enemies, I thought it was going to be okay. Thankfully, FBC isn’t keen on punishing you for your poor planning, and depending on your difficulty setting, you’ll have a series of lives to expend before it’s a total game over.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time blasting through the Oldest House with friends in tow. Unfortunately, beyond the initial exhilaration, I was disappointed to find that I didn’t feel as embedded in the Remedy Connected Universe as I was expecting. It is the nature of the replayable co-op shooter genre, I suppose, but the story only appears in loading screens and the occasional voice line on the main menu. So far, it’s left me with many stories, but I’m still keen for a little bit more lore, and hoping that it arrives as I push deeper into the difficulty modifiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, I’ve completed the final stage of each Jobsite and am now messing around with Corruption and Threat-based difficulty modifiers to unlock rare Research Samples that will allow me to specialise my perk build. There’s still a lot more to explore before I deliver my final review, like playing on my own and the forthcoming weapon upgrades, like the ‘Functional’ Submachine Gun that I’ve yet to unlock. But right now, despite how sparse the story can seem in moments, there’s a lot of fun to be had wrangling erratic monsters in Remedy’s spectacularly absurd bureaucratic setting. I’ll be playing more this week and wrap up this review as soon as I’ve tested the limits of Remedy’s chaotic cooperative job simulator.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite co-op games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When most people say their game is retro, they mean a particular era of game ranging from the NES to the PlayStation. That timespan encompasses the heyday of pixel-art gameplay and the burgeoning 3D revolution. It's not common for games to look even further back for their inspirations, to the earliest days of home console gaming. But that's exactly what Adventure of Samsara does, and it makes for a curious blend of motifs and mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara itself has a relatively long history. The game was pitched as a Kickstarter project in 2016, under the name <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774101425/tower-of-samsara" rel="nofollow ">Tower of Samsara</a>. It had set a modest (and very precise, numerically) goal of $48,561, but failed to achieve a third of that number. That may have been the end of the story, as just another indie game that never got off the ground. But Brazilian studio Ilex Games continued to pitch it until landing at Atari, where it morphed into a sci-fi offshoot of the classic Atari 2600 game Adventure. Adventure of Samsara is a marriage of the two, an Atari spokesperson told me--the game is as Ilex originally envisioned it, but it has weaved in story elements from Adventure to make it part of that universe.</p><p dir="ltr">That blend of inspirations means that it carries visual similarities to an Atari 2600 game. The pixel art is large and blocky and visual elements carry a flat layer of color that looks reminiscent of those early video games, while also looking much more advanced and modern than anything the original Atari could have produced. This is a retro pixel-art throwback, but the look is striking by being modeled after and modernizing such an early version of pixel art.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bta4dx3sgYc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bta4dx3sgYc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, the movement and combat itself feels reminiscent of Adventure or Prince of Persia, or for a somewhat more modern reference point, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. Everything from your walk cycle to the swing of your swords is deliberate and chunky, matching the visual style. A parry system rewards quick reflexes with a powerful strikeback, which is extremely necessary given the methodical movement of the hero.</p><p dir="ltr">And within this context it's a metroidvania, consisting of a wide-open map to explore as you unlock more tools and options. I only got to play a short guided demo, with an Atari rep directing me where to go to maximize what I could squeeze out of my time with it. But I got the sense that more than many modern metroidvanias, there were dangers lurking around the unseen corners. I was warned that if I had gone this way or that, I would've met a quick end--an approach that carries a refreshing old-school sensibility to the much more guided and safe metroidvanias that we've gotten accustomed to in modern games.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Atari hooks extend beyond the look and feel of the game, though. While Samsara retains its original plan for a sci-fi story that takes place on Pluto, the partnership with Atari has weaved in story hooks and Easter eggs from Adventure. I saw one such little treat during my brief time with it, by finding a dragon hidden among the Plutonian ruins. That combination gives the game an eerie, otherworldly feel, blending genres and continuities together within the isolated landscape. It's all a promising start for a game that, nearly 10 years ago, looked like it would never see the light of day.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>

                <p>It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades II</a> launched into early access, but today marks the game's third and last major content release before developer Supergiant Games diverts all attention to the rougelite's 1.0 launch.</p><p>The latest patch, called the Unseen Update, brings with it a host of changes and improvements, including balancing tweaks and combat improvements as has been synonymous with Supergiant's development process with its community. The update also includes some big content additions, including new aspects for all of its weapons, new optional dialogue and objectives for side characters, more powerful enemies in certain regions, and one special new song from the game's most popular band.

Supergiant Games states that its next objective is completing the game's true ending, adding achievements for all platforms, and doing a final pass on all of the game's elements to polish it as best as possible for launch. Despite the announcement, the post stresses that there is still no firm release date for Hades II, with word on that coming at a later date.</p><p>"Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support," the post concluded.</p><p>Hades II has been feature-rich since its initial launch into early access and has been greatly expanded on with each of the game's three content updates.

            <p>
If recent reports are true, we likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">won't be seeing Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console until 2027</a> at the earliest. But that hasn't stopped the company from teasing a couple of details - including backward compatibility and vague handheld allusions - as it announces a partnership with AMD to co-engineer the bits inside.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed an Xbox Series X/S successor was in the works</a> last February, as the company rushed to assure fans - amid the start of its multi-platform release strategy - that it wasn't abandoning the console market. At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond insisted Microsoft was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."
</p>
<p>
And it now transpires AMD will be the company helping make that bold promise a reality. Microsoft announced its "strategic, multi-year agreement" with AMD in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">short video shared earlier today</a>. In it, Bond explained Microsoft is "investing in [its] next-generation hardware line-up across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories", and would be working with AMD to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands".
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, quite a bit to unpack in that last sentence, starting with Bond's clear reference to multiple next-generation "consoles", and continuing on with the distinction between a machine "in your living room" and "in your hands". While it's entirely possible "consoles" refers to a dual release strategy similar to the Series X and S, it's hard to ignore the additional allusion to an Xbox-branded handheld. But whether that might be an internally development machine - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">previously rumoured</a> - or something similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xbox-ally-handhelds-microsoft-takes-its-next-step-towards-a-windows-driven-future">AMD's recently unveiled Xbox Ally</a>, remains to be seen. Notably, Windows Central recently reported Microsoft's internal handheld project <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">had been "sidelined"</a> in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">went further</a>, saying the project was "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Bond's spiel continued by insisting Microsoft's new AMD partnership would result in "the next generation of graphics innovation" and will "unlock a deeper visual quality". That's alongside "immersive gameplay and player experiences, enhanced with the power of AI", and "compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games".
</p>
<p>
"This is all about building a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delving you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device," Bond concluded. "The next generation of Xbox is coming to life and this is just the beginning. We can't wait to show you what's next."

		<p>Bungie has announced the delay of Marathon, their upcoming extraction shooter. The game will no longer release on 23rd September, and no new date has been given by Bungie for the game’s release.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team writes in a Marathon Development Update. “We’ve taken&nbsp;this&nbsp;to heart, and we know we need more time to craft&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;into the game that truly reflects your passion.&nbsp;After much discussion within our Dev team,&nbsp;we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release.</p>


<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat.</p>
<p>“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players. ”</p>
<p>The blog post also highlights areas that the studio is looking to improve before the game can be fully released, and which will be put under the microscope in upcoming testing. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding more social experiences
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bungie likely won’t give further updates on the game’s development for the next few months, as they say, “You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date.&nbsp;Thank you again for your patience and— much more importantly— your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make&nbsp;Marathon the&nbsp;incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team and PlayStation alike, as console maker looks to avoid having another ignominious flop of a live service title – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, of course, was a huge financial write down when the game was released, quickly pulled from shelves, and shut down last year. Bungie has endured <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> over the last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. With the initial reaction to Marathon since the gameplay reveal being rather mixed, Sony has put on a brave face for the game’s future, but it makes sense that the game is delayed to try and stick the landing.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that a delay could see Marathon miss the boat even further and fail to capitalise on the interest that there is in a new extraction shooter.</p>

The studio isn’t providing a new release date just yet, though has promised to share it sometime this fall.</p><p>The studio outlined a few “immediate focus areas” for the game. It plans to make AI encounters “more challenging and engaging” and make combat “more tense and strategic.” It’s “doubling down on the <em>Marathon</em> Universe” by increasing “visual fidelity,” including “more narrative and environmental storytelling,” and will introduce a “darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy.” (Bungie may also be making these visual changes after an artist said the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668449/bungie-marathon-art-plagiarism-ps5">lifted her artwork without permission</a>.) And it plans to add “more social experiences,” including proximity chat and improving things for solo and duo players.</p><p>“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like <em>Marathon</em> is built around,” according to the post. “This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”</p><p>Bungie hosted tests for <em>Marathon</em> earlier this year, and reviews <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marathon-alpha-test-impressions-1235329582/">were generally mid</a>. With this delay, we’ll see if Bungie can improve the game so that it doesn’t turn into another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">big live-service misstep for Sony</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yet, the legendary author who’s published 65 books and has dozens of films inspired by his imagination machine of a mind has found time for one more first: his first animated feature. <em>Lily</em> became King’s first-ever animated short, and its origins trace back all the way to his high school days.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197585,197583" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the pop-up-book-styled animated short, a young student named Robert is stuck between a rock and a nightmare as he has to deal with his cruel teacher, Ms. Sidley, and a large tiger named Lily in the bathroom. After his teacher berates him for choosing to urinate outside to avoid the tiger, her inspection of his claims has a devastating consequence for her. There’s no blood or gore—trademark components of many of our favorite Stephen King visual adaptations. There’s just kid-friendly horror in the Kate Siegel-directed short, which is exactly how King intended for it to be when he wrote the script according to <em>Lily</em>’s animator Pete Scalzitti, who spoke with <em>Kotaku </em>after the short’s screening at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p>“Last summer Stephen wrote our screenplay, adapting it himself from one of his earliest stories ever, <em>Here There Be Tygers</em>, which he actually wrote when he was in high school,” Scalzitti explains. “Deep cut fans of his short stories will notice he changed some of the plot, as well as the names of the main characters, using instead the names from another of his darkest short stories, <em>Suffer the Little Children</em>. But the plot is all <em>Tygers</em>.”</p><p><em>Here There Be Tygers</em> was released in 1968 when the prolific author was only 20 years old, and <em>Suffer the Little Children</em> was published four years later in 1972, making <em>Lily</em> a sterling example of the timelessness of King’s work. The hand-drawn animation makes <em>Lily</em> feel like it was pulled from a time capsule unblemished, and also makes it reminiscent of children’s picture books. All of this was intentional, even down to the way Siegel’s voice guides you through the horror.</p><p>“Kate chose to leave in Stephen’s screen directions and use them as narration, which she discussed with Stephen. This made the film feel like King was reading us a bedtime story, which gave me my solution for how to animate this in 21 days—I treated it like I was creating a pop-up book.”</p><p><em>Lily</em> is part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dark Corners</em></a></span>, a series created by Siegel and Krsy Fox, which features eight animated horror shorts meant to “gently or not so gently introduce children to the world of horror.” While there isn’t any official word on if and when King decides to drop another, don’t put it past the master of horror to dig back into his treasure trove of stories for an animated feast of terror for the eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Long before the Switch changed everything, I found myself more drawn to handheld gaming than the home console. I remember feeling more passionate about my Game Boy Advance library than the PlayStation 2. So it didn't come as much surprise to me when the Switch, and then the Steam Deck, captured so much of my attention and gaming time. The Steam Deck has since become my primary gaming device, due to its level of adaptability and wealth of cheap games on Steam. But even as a devoted Steam Deck acolyte, the ROG Xbox Ally X made an impression on me. There's a lot to be seen about the quasi-Xbox handheld, but it may even make a convert out of me.</p><p dir="ltr">I was able to try the ROG Xbox Ally X briefly at the Xbox showcase adjacent to Summer Game Fest. The presentation was mostly hands-off, with a brief period in which we were allowed to play Gears of War: Reloaded on it. So my impressions are a mixture of practical experience and big promises, but so far I like what I've both seen and heard.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, the actual ergonomics of the device feel very nice by default. I've equipped both my Steam Deck and my Switch 1 with third-party grips, increasing their bulk in exchange for a better feeling of holding it. The ROG Xbox Ally X cuts out the middleman and just includes the more substantial handles from the start, making it a little larger and weightier than competing devices, but no more than I've already been doing for myself with add-ons. As someone who primarily plays handheld systems at home or while traveling, I usually have a place to rest my arms while I play, so the increased weight won't be a problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller layout is meant to emulate the familiar Xbox controller, and to that end, it looks to succeed reasonably well. The Xbox button is no longer centered--obviously, since there's a screen in the middle--but its new placement within a ROG trapezoid shape makes enough sense. Everything else, from the sticks to the face buttons to the triggers, felt to my hands just like you were holding onto an Xbox controller, albeit one that had been stretched out in the middle to accommodate a screen.</p><p dir="ltr">The user interface, too, looks very similar to the current Xbox UI. That means the same large square icons to represent games in your library, with a sequence of panels to reach different areas of the interface. Impressively, though, Microsoft is promising that it will bring together all of your third-party libraries in one place. That means your Xbox and Game Pass library, naturally, but also storefronts like Epic and Steam. (The presentation didn't call Steam by name, but a Steam logo was prominently displayed in its slide about third-party storefronts).</p><p dir="ltr">I've gotten Xbox streaming and storefronts like Epic running on my Steam Deck, but it took a bit of setup, and I still forget which games I already own in Epic because I have to launch into its own storefront to see that library. Having all of my owned games across a variety of platforms is the kind of quality-of-life feature that makes the ROG Xbox Ally X feel more like what you would expect from the console experience: It just works the way you think it should work.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, elements like system performance are foregrounded in a way that feels more approachable for gamers who may not want to delve deep into system menus. Tapping or holding the Xbox button brings up different contextual menus showing things like power, RAM usage, and more. This is similar to the "..." button on the Steam Deck, but being tied to the main Xbox button makes it feel less like an afterthought.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Xbox representatives handed the ROG Xbox Ally X systems for us to demo, they were being treated very delicately, and our time was fairly short. It does feel like this is a piece of in-development tech and we were warned there could be hiccups. I didn't experience any, but the warning itself goes to show that the product isn't finalized. And later in the day when I went to play an extended Gears of War: Reloaded demo, the ROG option was just there alongside the Xbox and PS5 versions, so that gave me a bit more time with it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gears of War: Reloaded is, at its heart, still a game from the Xbox 360 era, but it's gotten a series of visual improvements that really stand out when shown side by side to the original. Everything is cleaner, and while the world is still grim, both Ultimate Edition and Reloaded have made it less muddy and brown. So it's hard to know how this should be judged as a benchmark compared to more modern performance-pressing games like Cyberpunk 2077. But the game looked and ran beautifully, and on top of that, the fan was nice and quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of unknown elements to the ROG Xbox Ally X, not least of all being its price tag. The 2024 Rog Ally X, sans Xbox elements, starts at a whopping $900, so we can probably expect the ROG Xbox Ally X to demand a similar price tag, if not more. Still, my brief hands-on did something that I haven't experienced since falling in love with my Steam Deck in 2022. It made me feel jealous.</p>

These items came to Battlefield 2042 as part of the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-8-9-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8.9.0 update</a> that arrived today, June 17.</p><p>The Galactic bundle costs 1750 BFC and the Scoped &amp; Dropped bundle is priced at 2,000 BFC. Alternatively, players can buy them together in the Citadel bundle for 3,000 BFC, which represents a savings compared to buying them individually. BFC can be purchased with real money or earned by progressing through Battlefield 2042's battle pass.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 is also rolling out a mode called "Conquest Ascension," which is inspired by Mass Effect. "<span>Rise above the rest and train for a new century of warfare. Use Ascension tactics with added crawl and squad spectating mechanics to assure the future for humanity that any commander would be proud of," reads a line from its description.</span></p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-crosses-over-with-dead-space-bringing-necromorphs-to-the-military-fps/1100-6524681/" data-ref-id="1100-6524681">Battlefield 2042 had a crossover with EA's Dead Space franchise in 2024.</a></p><p>While there are still people playing Battlefield 2042, many are eagerly awaiting the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, or whatever the next entry in the series is called. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">EA will officially reveal the game this summer</a>, but it remains to be seen exactly when that might happen.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">BioWare is now working on the next game</a>, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-show-brings-on-one-of-its-most-important-creative-roles-report/1100-6532187/" data-ref-id="1100-6532187">Mass Effect TV series is also in the works. </a></p>

                <p>One of the Switch 2's features is a much-improved kickstand, providing a more sturdy and durable way of propping the screen up in comparison with the original Switch. Some Switch 2 owners have realized that this kickstand can essentially be used as a mounting arm, leading to the creation of ways to attach the consoles to increasingly ridiculous places.</p><p>Some of these mounting methods are genuinely cool and useful, such as clamping the kickstand in between a tray table and a seatback in an airplane seat, as shown by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9rqno/new_use_for_the_switch_2_kickstand_on_a_plane/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/NintendoSwitch2 user Lokeze</a>. While many people will have no problems using the Switch 2 on a tray table, having the screen higher up and further away might be slightly more comfortable.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/player-finds-new-way-to-use-the-nintendo-switch-2-on-a-steering-wheel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> reported, though, there are also some people coming up with downright dangerous places to mount the console. One player figured out how to attach it to a car steering wheel--leading to a "setup" that, if driving, is almost certainly illegal throughout the United States and is definitely not something to try. I can imagine that it might be useful if you find yourself sitting in the driver's seat while parked for a long period of time, such as waiting in an airport cell phone lot... But be 100% certain that the car is not moving if you decide to check this out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996"></a><figcaption>Don't try this while moving.

Booo!</p>
<p>However, there's a silver lining — it's also getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Switch 2 Version</a>. The catch is that Switch 2 version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> release. <em>Sigh</em>.</p>
<p>Confirmed for a Western release back in March 2025, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the 13th entry in the long-running series that started back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky</a> in 2004 — which, coincidentally, is getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">remake in September</a>, published by GungHo.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The Game-Key Card part <em>is</em> disappointing, but we're looking forward to seeing how the game looks and runs on the newer console, at the very least. It doesn't look like this is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, so we don't know if there's an upgrade path, but <em>hopefully</em> there will be a way for fans to have that physical and have the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>Plus, the delay gives fans (like this writer) a chance to catch up on the series, especially with Trails in the Sky and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_vs_trails_in_the_sky_alternative_saga">Ys vs. Trails</a> spin-off coming out this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">announced</a> that its upcoming shooter, Marathon, has been delayed from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">September 23, 2025,</a> release date. No new release date was provided, instead Bungie said that the team would give players an update sometime this fall as to how the game's development is progressing, and would share a new release date at that time.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">blog post</a> from the Marathon development team, and is the most significant communication the team has had with players <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">since a live stream event</a> where Bungie addressed that a former artist on the Marathon team had used assets from artist Antireal without her permission.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you <span data-contrast="none">not only for your passionate feedback around the&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">Marathon&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">reveal and Alpha playtest, but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next</span></em> steps," Bungie began in the blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken&nbsp;this&nbsp;to heart, and we know we need more time to craft&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;into the game that truly reflects your passion.&nbsp;After much discussion within our Dev team,&nbsp;we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release.</em>"</p>
<p>The post continues to say that the team will use the extra time from this delay to "<em>create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around</em>," and also specifies which areas of the game the studio will be immediately focusing on.</p>
<p>These areas include "<em>upping the survival game</em>," which Bungie clarifies to mean bringing "<em>more channeling and engaging AI encounters,</em>" as well as "<em>more rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</em>," and&nbsp;<em>"making combat more tense and strategic</em>."</p>
<p>Bungie also adds that it will be "<em>doubling down on the Marathon universe</em>," which it describes as the team adding "<em>increased visual fidelity,"</em> along with "<em>more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</em>," and "<em>a darker tone that delivers on themes of the original trilogy</em>."</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio also specifies that it will be working on improving the experience for solo and duo players, as well as adding proximity chat support to the game.</p>
<p>"<em>You'll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we've made, alongside the game's new release date</em>," Bungie continues. "<em>Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be</em>."</p>
<p>Realistically, this delay comes as no surprise. Beyond the fact that there were<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/"> rumblings about a marketing campaign for the game</a> being canceled, the fact that there was clearly a significant amount of art assets used in designing the entire style and visual language of the game felt like a clear sign that it would take a lot of work to remove that and insert something that wasn't stolen.</p>
<p>Hopefully, when this fall rolls around, we can finally hear some good news about Marathon from Bungie, and not that the game continues to be in a development hellhole.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shocking No One, Bungie's Marathon Delayed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed.1221045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an announcement that is surprising no one, Bungie has announced a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>delay, meaning that you will not be seeing their extraction shooter on September 23rd.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marathon Development Update">announcement</a>, Bungie shares that they came to this decision after reviewing the feedback from the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>alpha playtest, which had left many users feeling noplussed with the game. The announcement shares three areas of focus that they will be working on (among others):</p>

<ul><li>Improved survival game play
	<ul><li>Better and more difficult AI encounters</li>
		<li>Better rewards in loot and events</li>
		<li>Improving combat</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Setting and visuals
	<ul><li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
		<li>More environmental storytelling and narrative&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A darker tone like the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;trilogy</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Social Experiences
	<ul><li>Proximity chat</li>
		<li>Better player experience in single and duo play.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>This work will be further informed by them continuing to playtest&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marathon Release Date and First Gameplay Revealed">users who were in the Alpha</a>. These will be closed playtests, so if you weren't part of the playtest already, you shouldn't expect a chance to hop into&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;anytime soon.</p>

<p>The announcement doesn't state when they are going to release&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;now, but given that Sony had been recently touting it as releasing inside the fiscal 2025 year, it seems likely to be releasing during the first three months of 2026 if they can. Bungie states that they will be announcing the new release date and revealing the changes they've made over the summer sometime this Fall, perhaps even on the previous release date of September 23rd.</p>

<p>This isn't the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Destiny 2 Developer Bungie Suffers Layoffs Among Reported Delays for The Final Shape and Marathon">first delay</a> for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;as Bungie attempts to nail down this new format and get a live service formula for it that they believe can work. Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Concord Shutting Down, Sony Offering Full Refunds">high profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>&nbsp;</a>last year, which was followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sony Cancels Two Live Service Games, God of War Reportedly Among Them">cancellations</a> of many first party 'games as a service' type projects at Sony Interactive,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>is being counted on to demonstrate that Sony can make something in this field. Unusually this has to be shown to investors who want the money from a live service game, and gamers who may hesistate following how quickly Sony pulled the plug on their last attempt in the area.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the extra time should make sure that there's no <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Acknowledges Stolen Marathon Art, Promises &quot;Thorough Review&quot;">plagiarized art</a> in the next version of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;right Bungie?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark and Darker</a> is a bit of a Schroedinger's video game, isn't it? Seemingly fleeting back and forth between a state of being available for sale and being outright delisted. Back in March, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> extraction game was delisted from the Epic Games Store, with developer Ironmace saying at the time that the "decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute." 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Epic appear to be sending out emails to those that have the game in their libraries informing them that the game will no longer be playable this year (I've received this email myself as I apparently added it to my library at some point despite not having played it). 
</p>
<p>
"We removed Dark and Darker from sale on the Epic Games Store on March 5 in consideration of a court decision in Korea between Nexon and the game's publisher, Ironmace," Epic wrote in the email. "On November 1, 2025, we will be removing Dark and Darker from your library, at which point it will no longer be playable via the Epic Games Store." Anyone that paid for the Legendary Status upgrade will be getting a refund, though those that bought Redstone shards won't be. Both of these are no longer available for purchase as well.
</p>
<p>
The court decision Epic referenced is likely the <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250213/seoul-court-rules-pc-game-dark-and-darker-did-not-infringe-nexons-copyright-but-orders-compensation">one from February</a>, which found that Ironmace didn't infringe on Nexon's copyright of project P3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexon-are-suing-dark-and-darker-developers-over-copyright-infringement">a game that Nexon alleged was then turned into Dark and Darker using stolen code and assets</a>. However, the court did also instruct Ironmace to pay Nexon 8.5 billion won (about $6.18 million) in damages.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, at this point in time it doesn't seem like the game is being booted off of Steam, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-following-accusations-of-stolen-trade-secrets">despite previously facing this in 2023</a>. It's a messy situation, one that I would guess isn't quite done yet.

It all sounds like a promising pivot away from the company’s shrinking console business, but it also raises lots of questions about what the future of Xbox will actually look like. </p><p>A new generation of Xbox consoles is coming, but will they be traditional consoles or mini-PC devices running an evolving version of Windows? Bond stresses compatibility with existing players’ current libraries of Xbox games, but most Xbox games haven’t been ported to PC and would need specialty solutions to maintain access at the hardware level rather than just making them playable with cloud gaming like Sony does with the PS3 generation. Will it even have a disc drive? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.">Increasingly, the vibe appears to be no</a></span>. <br></p><p>Bond also emphasizes that the future of Xbox isn’t tied to a single store or device, once again opening the door to new hardware potentially supporting things like Steam, which has traditionally been a competitor to Windows gaming. Then there’s the bit about working to “ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.” Unless that’s simply a nod to the fact that most PCs people play games on also run Windows, it sounds like a hint that the foundation of Xbox’s future will be Microsoft’s current cash cow OS with an Xbox layer overtop, rather than a bespoke platform built from the ground up for gaming as Xbox has previously been. <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren suggested as much in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his breakdown of the Xbox Ally last week</a></span>. </p><p>“Everything, everywhere, whenever you want” is a compelling marketing pitch that could easily become bedeviled by the details. As it stands, no single company controls as many pieces of the puzzle as Microsoft—software, hardware, and a massive publishing apparatus—but that doesn’t mean they will magically all start fitting together in a way that makes sense or doesn’t require tons of extra investment. And the other truth about Xbox at the moment is it seems burdened more than ever by they need to justify its P&amp;L to the larger company, which is otherwise all but obsessed with cloud computing and AI. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="FF TACTICS REMASTER CUT CONTENT" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d36bc87bfa3d6/ff-tactics-remaster-cut-content.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>The team behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remaster, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, has been talking shop in an interview over at the official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">Square Enix website</a> (spotted via <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-had-to-be-brute-forc-1851784636">Kotaku</a>). But this interview reveals that not all content from previous releases of the game will be present.</p>
<p>During the in-depth chat, the remaster’s director, Square Enix and Creative Unit III's Kazutoyo Maehiro, when asked about the biggest challenges involved, was quick to point out how the creation of this new version of the game was an arduous procedure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The process saw the team faced with cobbling the remaster together from numerous versions and sources - mostly due to the fact a game's source code back from the PS1 version could so quickly be augmented or deleted in part, or even entirely. Maehiro says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone...</p>
<p>The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work - on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While The Ivalice Chronicles enhances the original game with a host of improvements, which include updated UI, new difficulty options, all-new voice acting and conversations, and modern quality-of-life features like autosave, battle speed changes and so on, the PSP content won't be included in this rerelease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions">Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</a>, which launched in 2007 on Sony's portable handheld, is probably the most beloved version. It added in a Shakespeare-styled script, additional cutscenes, extra job classes in Dark Knight and Onion Knight, and a multiplayer mode. All of this has been dropped for 2025's version.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Maehiro explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions. However, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our first step in reviving Final Fantasy Tactics in the present was to adhere to the original and put a spotlight on the original game’s characters and jobs, as well as the original gameplay experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst this is understandable, and the PSP version did also have some big performance issues, it's definitely a disappointment that we aren't seeing a big push for a fully inclusive final edition of sorts here. That also means the iOS version has been sidelined here, too.</p>
<p>The full interview is worth checking out via the link above, as Maehiro is full of lovely little tidbits of information about the process of putting the game together thus far!</p>
