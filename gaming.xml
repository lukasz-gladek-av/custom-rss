			<p>The Trump tariffs on imports from Mexico could have a strong impact on the video games market in the United States and lead to fewer disc-based releases and higher prices for both physical and digital games, according to an analyst.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Circana Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella</a> highlighted how 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico could lead to a "sharp downtick" in the number of physical releases in the United States, as much of the production infrastructure is located in Mexico. If they do get made, prices could rise for both physical and digital games, as digital games' MSRPs would be increased to remain at price parity with physical releases. No matter what happens precisely, however, Mat Piscatella doesn't see anything good coming for the physical video game market in the near future.</p>

<p lang="en">Alright, well, video games.</p>
<p>With 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico on the way, I can see a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US, as much of that production infrastructure is in Mexico.</p>
<p>If they do get made, I expect higher prices both phys &amp; dig.</p>

<p>The analyst remarks that moving the production of retail releases to the US to avoid being impacted by the Trump tariffs is definitely possible with significant investment. However, this significant investment is unlikely to come, as annual US physical video game software spending is half what it was in 2021 and is declining rapidly. At the same time, moving production to the US wouldn't help when it comes to cost, so there aren't a lot of incentives to move production to the United States.</p>

<p lang="en">'Can't that production just be moved to the US?'</p>
<p>With significant investment, sure. But annual US physical video game software spending is now half what it was in 2021 and declining rapidly.</p>
<p>And this also wouldn't help when it comes to costs.</p>
<p>Not a good combo to incentive that investment. IMO.</p>

<p>No matter what is going to happen in the near future with the new Trump tariffs, it looks like a price increase for video games seems almost inevitable, and the whole industry seems to be pushing towards it, in one way or another. As highlighted in a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, much of the video game industry is hoping that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be priced higher than the current $70 barrier and thus re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arma&nbsp;</em>studio Bohemia Interactive has reported an "extremely successful 2024", contrasting against what the Czech studio calls the "global stagnation" of the gaming industry at large.</p>

<p>In a press release, Bohemia says its revenue jumped 34% in 2024, reaching a total of $60.8 million. The company managed to sell 4.85 million copies of its games across PC and consoles last year, with player numbers hitting 17 million around the world.</p>

<p>According to Bohemia, 99% of those sales came from "abroad" rather than from its native Czech Republic, with the US enjoying a 42% market share. Bohemia also reports "significant growth" in Ukraine, which saw player numbers doubling year-on year, and points to Brazil as a market of "growing importance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-dayz-frostline.jpg?itok=FcH4lApj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-dayz-frostline.jpg?itok=mHDeG0uf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>17 million players played Bohemia Interactive's games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>DayZ </em>and its&nbsp;<em>Frostline&nbsp;</em>DLC,&nbsp;last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Bohemia co-founder&nbsp;Slavomír Pavlíček says 2024 "exceeded all our expectations" and that&nbsp;<em>Arma Reforger</em>, which launched on PS5 in December last year, "currently has no competition in its genre" on Sony's platform, which contributed to Bohemia's success.</p>

<p>The studio also says that fans can look forward to "interesting game surprises" over the coming year, including the "intensive development" of&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>, which is now expected to launch sometime in 2027.</p>

<p>More games under the Bohemia Incubator program, through which Bohemia gives smaller teams funding and publishing support for their games, will also be introduced this year, with action platformer&nbsp;<em>Brute Horse&nbsp;</em>and sandbox RPG&nbsp;<em>SkyVerse&nbsp;</em>both on Bohemia's 2024 infographic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=SzUDqc8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=nUtvCWyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bohemia had a pretty good 2024, all things considered.</figcaption></figure><p>The "global stagnation" of which Bohemia speaks has seen a lot of game studios caught up in its field, with major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> laying off staff members, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down studios</a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">canceling live service games shortly after release</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Bohemia's growth certainly goes against the grain in that regard, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-watering cash</a> some of these companies' C-suites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home for themselves</a> last year and the year before, I'd question whether those decisions were, in fact, made due to industry trends.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll bring you more on what Bohemia Interactive gets up to in 2025 as and when we get it, so stay tuned for that.</p>

The EA App is as clunky and frustrating as Origin ever was, a completely unnecessary obstacle between you and just double-clicking the icon for the game you want to play, but when you want to play <em>Burnout Paradise</em> for the 943rd time, it’s no more of an ordeal than it was before.</p><p>The real issues arrive if you’re running a 32-bit version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/ea/ea-app/update-mac-operating-system-for-ea-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac</a></span>.</p><p>The number of people who will be affected will admittedly be small, but a small number of a very big number still means an awful lot of people will be scuppered. If you’re in this group, the games you already own on Origin—despite not changing in any way—will not be playable via the EA app, and given Origin’s going to absolutely stop working entirely in three months, if you don’t upgrade your machine, you’re not going to be able to play them at all.</p><p>If you’re on Windows 11, you’re good, as Microsoft never released a 32-bit version of that OS, but Windows 10 users prior to 2020 could still buy a 32-bit version of the software, and upgrading it is a real pain in the ass. It involves entirely formatting the hard disk on which Windows is installed, and reinstalling Windows in its 64-bit incarnation. (If you’re not sure which you have, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d#:~:text=Upgrading%20from%20the%2032%2Dbit,you%20had%20on%20your%20device." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link will help</a></span>.) And that means you’ll need a CPU which can do that. Fortunately, you almost definitely do (follow that previous link and look for “System type” in the Settings window it pops open, and you should hopefully see “64-bit operating system, x64-based processor”).</p><p>If you don’t, however, your PC is probably extremely elderly, and to carry on playing your EA games, you’ll need to completely upgrade the whole thing. Or more realistically, replace it. So yeah, if you’re still running a decrepit old PC because that’s what you can afford right now, you will no longer be able to play the EA games you thought you owned.</p><p>That sucks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Back in the '90s, there were several animated adaptations of popular video games, and two of them are headed to Blu-ray soon. Discotek has officially announced that the Street Fighter and Darkstalker TV series will be getting the Blu-ray treatment, which includes brand-new cover art and a surprising amount of extra content.</p><p>Just to be clear, these shows are products of a time when animated series followed a set of family-friendly guidelines. Violence was naturally toned down since the shows were aimed at younger audiences, and the storylines mixed references to the games with plots that were designed to get you to buy licensed action figures. Still, there's a certain charm to these classic cartoons, and Discotek is packing quite a few extras on each release.</p><p>Street Fighter: The Animated Series is a wonderfully weird adaptation, as it revolves around Guile leading an international task force of martial artists against M Bison and his Shadaloo syndicate. Yes, it's basically GI Joe but with more sonic booms and hadoukens. For the Blu-ray release, all 26 episodes have been included, you can view the original intro for the show in storyboard mode, an art gallery has been included, and there are game-inspired menus.</p><p>All 26 episodes come with commentary tracks narrated by notable members of the fighting game and YouTube community, like Matt McMuscles, Maximillian Dood, Justin Wong, Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson, Alexs Le, Lythero, and Guile Win Quote. Interestingly, the cartoon is a sequel to the iconic live-action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia, and if you're looking to get that film, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighter-Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B09HFXX64T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">really nice steelbook version</a> was released not too long ago.

Loosely based on the first Darkstalkers game, the TV series was aimed at a younger audience and had a much more lighthearted tone in comparison. It also had animation that varied wildly in quality, nonsensical plots, and hilariously bad voice acting.</p><p>If you're looking for something that is so bad that it goes full circle and actually becomes good, then this time capsule of Saturday-morning-cartoon energy might appeal to you. Extras haven't been confirmed for the Blu-ray yet, but if the Street Fighter release is any indication, then you can count on Discotek to unearth some interesting archival material for this release.</p>

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has now passed 5m copies sold.</p>
<p>That's more than double the sales since last August, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">game passed 2m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Since then it's released on mobile and has seen a surge in popularity following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">multiple wins at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the mobile release, Balatro was added to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription service, but it would appear those players are not included in these 5m individual sales.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the Balatro social media account, which implored fans to try out more indie games.</p>
<p>"The last few weeks have been pretty wild," the post reads. "To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at thegameawards, we hope you're having an amazing time with it!</p>

<p>Balatro was released in February last year and is available across PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>It won best mobile game, best debut indie game, and best independent game at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Two months after its release on mobile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">report estimated the game had generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone</a>.</p>
<p>LocalThunk has stated he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-creator-sometimes-regrets-its-success-and-wants-to-stay-anonymous">wishes to remain anonymous</a> and, in a previous interview, admitted he regrets the game's success. "Honestly, yeah," he said. "Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-promises-new-limited-time-mode-and-more.1087752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and it comes complete with adjustments to the game's modes and battle system, as well as a new limited-time mode (although that technically hasn't arrived yet).</p>

<p>Somewhat confusingly, in the update's official <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/update-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-changes-and-adjustments-features-and-battle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Bandai Namco says the Legendary Warrior Face-Off mode "has been added for a limited time", but players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/where_is_the_new_gamemode_at/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reporting</a> that they're <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6446m/so_how_can_i_access_legendary_warrior_faceoff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unable</a> to access it, even though the update has been applied.</p>

<p>However, other players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/comment/m8940nx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a>&nbsp;that the new mode will arrive alongside the game's first major DLC, which is currently available for those who forked out for 72 hours' access but which is not on general release yet. It's set to arrive later this week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=HD1MeMgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=RPGUa0zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>mode will probably arrive later this week alongside the game's first DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1880255701613711711" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bandai Namco's X page (which also doesn't confirm the release date for the mode), Legendary Warrior Face-Off will allow you to "challenge yourself against characters with sky-high power levels", with the first being iconic Saiyan Broly.</p>

<p>The patch notes clarify that you "cannot select this mode outside of the period" during which it's available, although rather unhelpfully, that period isn't specified.</p>

<p>The wording of Bandai Namco's post, however, suggests that there will be other warriors against whom you can face off, so presumably, this mode will cycle in and out periodically, offering different characters to fight.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s first DLC, that's due out on January 24th, so that's probably also when Legendary Warrior Face-Off will become available. The "Hero of Justice" pack adds a number of new characters, including the likes of Gamma, new Gohan variants, and more.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games and the first to bear the series' original Japanese name in the West.</p>

<p>The game launched in October to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies</a> across all platforms within its first day on sale.</p>

The Firework Season starts January 23rd. The update will be themed around Lunar New Year celebrations, starting a new Mira Journey battle pass while offering limited-time quests and a new area to explore.</p><p><a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news"><em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s official website</a> has previews of what outfits will be available as well as a full breakdown of all the new content. Since <em>Nikki </em>is a gacha game, there are a number of premium outfits to try and earn. But developer Infold is also offering three outfits in three colors for a total of nine different outfits all for free. I’m particularly intrigued by the Radiant Night outfit as it looks like as a high-fashion version of <em>Resident Evil VII</em>’s Lady Dimitrescu.</p><p>Check it out as the website also has codes players can use to redeem helpful in-game items.<em> Infinity Nikki</em> has also released a trailer for the update showing off the Firework Isles, the new location that will be available during the season. Expect the the area to be chock full of scenic vistas for stylists to take their best pictures including a magical horse-drawn carriage that zooms through the sky.</p><p>The game’s also adding a new boss encounter, The Dark Bouquet, which will probably be added to the Realm of the Dark boss list for players to challenge weekly. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> soundtrack is also launching on select music platforms which is a welcome development considering some of those tracks — especially the one for the Ghost Train dungeon — are incredibly funky for a generally lighthearted dress-up game. Fireworks Season starts January 23rd and lasts until February 25th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And now, a new Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 release date theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one (believe it or not there are more than a few GTA 6 theories doing the rounds) was sparked into life by <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1879925333790539845" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another seemingly innocuous GTA Online promo tweet by Rockstar Games</a>. “Claim a free Vapid Dominator GT muscle car and more with GTA+,” the tweet reads. “Members also earn bonuses on Priority FIB Files and Terrorbyte Client Missions, save with Arcade Property discounts, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What information-starved GTA fans were most interested in, however, was the accompanying image, which includes a shot of a metal shipping container with a series of numbers printed on its side. One number is singled out with a slightly enlarged font and a rectangle around it: 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/gta-main-1737468480158.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The numbers Mason, what do they mean?!

It turns out the release dates for both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V were announced on a Thursday. January 30, 2025 is a Thursday. Coincidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have also pointed out that Rockstar parent company Take-Two is set to release its next set of financial results on February 6, so a release date announcement as part of a new trailer beforehand might make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve been here before, of course. Multiple times. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset in the 13 months since. The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2. These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even analyzing registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crazy? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-could-easily-announce-the-gta-6-trailer-2-release-date-but-its-staying-quiet-on-purpose-because-its-a-really-good-marketing-tactic-ex-dev-says">One former developer at Rockstar recently expressed his delight at the many wild conspiracy theories surrounding GTA 6</a>, insisting staff at the studio will be enjoying watching the community go off the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>One of the first executive orders that President Trump discussed on Monday after his inauguration was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-energy-economy-inflation-ev-oil-gas-00be8d3d5216a328e129666032c889e1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new 25% tariff for Mexico and Canada that is expected to become effective February 1</a>. A good amount of production infrastructure for video game discs happens in Mexico, so what's the effect going to be for the end consumer? No one knows yet. And who knows if the order will even happen. But Circana analyst Mat Piscatella has now shared his thoughts on how the new tariffs could impact people who play video games, and he's expecting higher prices overall.</p><p>Posting on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Piscatella said he expects to see a "sharp downtick" in the number of disc-based games that are released in the US, given that "much of that production infrastructure" is in Mexico. If companies still go ahead with making discs, then consumers can expect higher prices, he said. And not just for physical discs. Piscatella said he expects digital game prices to go up as well.</p><p>A digital game has no disc, of course, but companies may want to retain price parity all the same between physical and digital in the event of tariff-driven price increases, Piscatella said. He added that he doesn't know how this will all actually shake out and is only theorizing for now. However, he said, "None of this is good for the physical video game market."</p><p>Piscatella added that US-based video game companies could shift production out of Mexico and into the US, but not without "significant investment." That's probably not going to happen, in part because spending on physical games in the US is already half of what it was in 2021 and continues to decline "rapidly," Piscatella said.</p><p>Trump has also suggested he could implement a 60% tariff on goods from China, which could have significant ramifications on video games and video game hardware. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">many question if that's even feasible or likely to happen</a>.</p><p>Beyond video game price increases tied to potential tariffs, some in the video game business are wondering if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 could trigger a new industry-wide price increase on the MSRP for games, potentially up to $80 or above.</a> The most recent price increase from $60 to $70 was <a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881071892557410389" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">embraced without issue</a>, experts say, and another increase could follow.</p>

            <p>If you fancy kicking off the new year with another Xbox controller variant, good news. Microsoft has revealed the latest edition to its Cipher family of controllers, and this one comes in a bright red hue.</p>
<p>The Pulse Cipher Special Edition features a translucent top case, so you can see the controller's inner workings. It follows the same overall design as Xbox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-going-a-bit-90s-with-its-new-transparent-blue-sky-cipher-controller">Sky Cipher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-ghost-cipher-special-edition-wireless-controller">Ghost Cipher</a> models, but with a different colour palette. It features a colour palette where "modern gaming meets enduring nostalgia", Xbox said.</p>
<p>You can see how it looks - front and back - in the image below.</p>

<p>The red Pulse Cipher Special Edition is available to pre-order today ahead of its launch on 4th February, priced <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/pulse-cipher-special-edition">£70</a>.</p>
<p>In September of last year, Microsoft also revealed some transparent Cipher Series top cases, along with some chromatic D-pad and paddles, for its Elite Series 2 controllers. These top cases are inspired by the "translucent tech of the '90s and early 2000s", and are available via <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in Microsoft news, later this week the company is hosting an Xbox Developer Direct showcase. Things will kick off at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January, with Microsoft promising us a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game</a> from an unknown studio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-release-likely-between-april-and-september-says-nacon.1087710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon, the company behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>and <i>GreedFall 2</i>, has released a new financial statement, and it contains a prediction regarding the Switch 2 launch window.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CP_Nacon_CA-T3-2024-25-Diffusion-English.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>&nbsp;covers the period between April and December last year, during which time Nacon's consolidated sales rose by 2.5%, driven mainly by its non-gaming ventures. The company's gaming business fell by 4.6% in that nine-month period when compared to last year.</p>

<p>Later in the statement, Nacon looks ahead to the first half of the next fiscal year, during which the company says it anticipates "the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2 console". Nacon also says it "already has compatible games and a full range of accessories" for that console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=PaZsI9mZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=QgRbPPmN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon reckons the Switch 2 will launch between April and September this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Just as a reminder, since the financial year begins for Nacon in April, that means the company anticipates the release of the Switch 2 sometime between April and September.</p>

<p>Given that we know a Nintendo Direct presentation is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air on April 2nd</a>, this release window timing, which is admittedly rather broad, would make a lot of sense. If I had to guess, I'd put the release in June, although that's just a gut feeling.</p>

<p>When Nacon says it already has games and accessories ready to go for the Nintendo Switch 2, the company is referring to a range of Switch 2 accessories it <a href="https://x.com/Nacon/status/1879938882244088080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled last week</a>, including cases, controller housings, and more.</p>

<p>On the game front, while Nacon may well be referring to some of the games on its upcoming slate, it could also be pointing to the range of games it's already released for the Switch, since the new console will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">largely be backwards compatible</a> with the original.</p>

<p>The studio is set to reveal "the main ones" in that lineup during this year's Nacon Connect event, which will take place on March 6th. Previous Nacon Connect events gave us reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow"><em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Reflector Entertainment, the developer behind Unknown 9: Awakening, is the latest studio to be hit by layoffs. The news comes after what its CEO calls the “failure” of the game.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy statement</a> posted on LinkedIn, CEO Herve Hoerdt said that he made a decision to “not greenlight further work on a future project that was in the conceptualization phase and thus terminating this development line”. This decision, he says, wouldn’t have been sustainable for the company and, with it, comes layoffs.</p>



<p>“This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio’s ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe,” Hoerdt said. “The performance of the release didn’t come near the company expectations, after numerous timeline adjustments and investments, both financially and other, and didn’t warrant any further exploration in this universe.”</p>



<p>Hoerdt added that the decision will also affect back-office staff as the studio moves its support teams to be inline with a “single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future.” </p>



<p>“Where possible, staff will be assigned to this project, based on an existing Bandai Namco IP, which is shaping up very well,” he said.</p>



<p>Hoerdt closed his statement by saying that those impacted will receive severance packages, health benefits, mental health support, and more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Reflector Entertainment for clarification on the number of people let go in the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sniper-elite-resistance-release-date%E2%80%94release-time-platforms-editions-price.1087695/</guid>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance is the latest sniper-centric release casting us into the heart of World War Two. It carries on a lot of the good work of the previous iteration and we’ve rounded up the crucial release details.</p>



<p>Rebellion Developments (more commonly known as Rebellion) has developed and published numerous games since 1991. But the Sniper Elite series has become one of its biggest hits in the last 10 years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a continuation of the refined and reliably violent stealth shooter. I say stealth, knowing full well many of my missions over the years have descended into unbridled chaos.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, 2025’s Sniper Elite Resistance presents another war-torn power struggle with a new marksman at the lens. Here’s everything we know including its release date, price point, and platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-release-date">Sniper Elite Resistance Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We aim to please. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance has a January 30 release date.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest games in January 2025</a> haven’t set the world alight. But Resistance is looking to be the bright spark that adds a bit of warmth and character to the year’s beginning. Who doesn’t want the searing heat and intensity of a whirring Sniper Rifle bullet whistling into their chest?</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-release-time">Sniper Elite Resistance Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Until Rebellion says otherwise, we’re likely locking and loading for a midnight launch for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Special launch times are sometimes issued for releases—deviating from the norm. But it’s looking like a basic midnight launch window for <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. This means Rebellion’s newest shooter has the same start time, but where you live dictates how long it is until you get to sample the sniping for yourself.</p>



<p>New Zealand residents always get midnight launches first because of time zones. Releasing at the same time in every country isn’t common, and I don’t expect it to be the case here. </p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-platforms">Sniper Elite Resistance Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the main platforms for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I’m quite surprised to see the continued support for old-gen consoles. This is good news for everyone as it allows more players to try out Resistance, and gives the release every chance to maximize its success. I think we call this a (fitting) bullseye.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-price">Sniper Elite Resistance Price</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance retails at $59.99 or £54.99 for the Standard Edition, and $89.99 or £73.99 for the Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>If you buy physical editions of games, you’re unlikely to pay this much. <strong>Various retailers are bound to offer it much cheaper</strong>, and the good news is the Deluxe Edition isn’t a digital exclusive—depending on how keen you are for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-editions">Sniper Elite Resistance Editions</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy a Standard or Deluxe Edition for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s no Collector’s Edition for die-hard fans. If you’re a long-time fan desperate for a replica Sniper Elite Rifle or a bizarre, lifesize eye replica—I’ve seen more unusual items in Collector’s Editions—you’re out of luck. </p>



<hr>



<p>How long have you been a fan of the Sniper Elite franchise? Could Resistance be the finest release yet?</p>

Due to the issue, players have been missing out on time-based content such as daily login rewards and missions. Second Dinner has already committed to making sure players that have been affected will be compensated, but the details have not been revealed yet.</p><p>Furthermore, the game was also removed from app stores, and Second Dinner is working on getting it restored. While in-app purchases remain unavailable, web-shop purchases are still working, and the team is looking to fix the issue.</p><p>When TikTok briefly went offline on January 19, so did Marvel Snap, due to its publisher, Nuverse, being a part of TikTok parent company Bytedance (although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-publisher-suffers-layoffs-could-shut-down-report/1100-6519484/" data-ref-id="1100-6519484">Nuverse had already divested from Bytedance</a>). However, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/tiktok-future-donald-trump-ban-sale/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed an executive action that delayed TikTok's ban for 75 days</a>. Second Dinner is presumably looking for a new publisher in the meantime so Marvel Snap isn't at risk of being banned again in case the TikTok ban delay expires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Reflector Entertainment has canceled an in-development project and laid off a number of staff following what it calls the "failure" of its first game.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Reflector CEO Herve Hoerdt says he's "made the decision not to greenlight further work" on a project that was in the "conceptualization phase", thus "terminating this development line". In layman's terms, that effectively seems to mean he's canceled an ongoing development project.</p>

<p>Hoerdt puts the cancellation down to the "failure" of Reflector's "ambitious and courageous first project", which he describes as a "new IP with a rich transmedia universe". He is, of course, referring to&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which is Reflector's first (and, to date, only) game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=E-CQpTRH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=Re1hIfMW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>wasn't a success for Reflector, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The CEO goes on to admit that&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"didn't come near the company expectations" with regards to sales performance, and that the world of the game doesn't "warrant any further exploration" as a result.</p>

<p>He says that the canceled project continuing "would not have been sustainable" for Reflector, but that it will result in "redundancies", although he doesn't state how many.</p>

<p>Going forward, Hoerdt says Reflector will work on a single project at a time, an approach that's also been espoused by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Rime&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Tequila Works</a> (although that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency" rel="nofollow">insolvency</a> puts the future of said project into question in that case).</p>

<p>Reflector is currently working on a game "based on an existing Bandai Namco IP", and Hoerdt says development on that project is "shaping up very well", although naturally, he doesn't say what it might be.</p>

<p>The company has also recently enjoyed success with fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, which managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">top three million sales in a single day</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>itself, you can, if you're so inclined, check out the action adventure game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477940/Unknown_9_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/unknown-9-awakening/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/unknown-9-awakening/9p486zcvt126" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

                <p>Activision has released a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gargantuan blog post</a> in which it responded to fans' ongoing concerns and criticisms about the state of Call of Duty, and one section confirms that the developer will temporarily scale back its content plans for Warzone as it aims to improve the game first.</p><p>In the blog post, Activision said it has made the decision to "prioritize focus on gameplay tuning, adding more quality of life, and addressing ongoing bugs." Because of this shift in focus, Activision said some of the new content originally planned for Season 2 "has been shifted to create bandwidth to address foundational issues." Activision did not specify what Season 2 content is being delayed, however.</p><p>Activision said it has numerous updates in the works for Warzone that aim to create the "most solid foundation" for the game. These updates will be released over time, and include gameplay adjustments such as reload speeds up to 20% faster for every weapon in the game. Activision is also reducing the penalty for sprint-to-fire from 35% to 10% and increasing the jump ADS speeds by 25%.</p><p>Additionally, the parachute cut animation has been increased so players can transition from cutting the parachute to getting into the action "significantly faster." Other updates include advanced UAVs now showing elevation arrows and the Spy Camera outline effect no longer rendering through walls.</p><p>Warzone is getting lots of bug fixes, too, including all of these listed below.</p><ul><li><h4>Map &amp; Gameplay Issues</h4><ul><li>Addressed visibility of dark areas and characters on Rebirth Island.</li><li>Addressed players being forced to stand up while reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed exploits allowing players to access unintended areas of the map.</li><li>Addressed parachutes deploying when jumping off ladders.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h4><ul><li>Addressed weapons becoming inaccessible near interactable areas.</li><li>Addressed weapons falling through Buy Station models.</li><li>Addressed weapon tooltips appearing as common when dropped to the ground.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Perks &amp; Contracts</h4><ul><li>Addressed Ghost persisting through the prematch lobby into the match.</li><li>Addressed Cold Blooded not properly countering Tracker.</li><li>Addressed Quick Fix health regen not properly activating while plating.</li><li>Addressed Survivor preventing players from reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed Most Wanted contracts not overriding respawn timers as intended.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Operators</h4><ul><li>Addressed Operator selection appearance issues in menu.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Finally, Activision said some of the issues with Warzone that players have reported in recent weeks may have to do with the integration of Black Ops 6's content into the game.</p><p>"We want to take a moment to reflect on the significance of Black Ops 6's integration--the largest in Call of Duty history--which, for the first time, has brought our teams and products together into a unified development environment," Activision said. "While this transformation has presented its share of obstacles, it also paves the way for more ambitious updates and closer collaboration in the future. We’re essentially laying a foundation to make new technology immediately available to all of our studios, improving development pipelines and the stability of porting features between titles, and allowing us to focus more of our time on future releases."</p><p>As for Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Activision is making some welcome changes as well, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-finally-let-players-disable-cross-play-for-ranked-play/1100-6528900/" data-ref-id="1100-6528900">finally allowing players to disable cross-play in Ranked matches. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Card battler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>has come back online in the US following an outage related to the shutdown of TikTok, and developer Second Dinner has promised changes in the future to avoid a repeat of the downtime.</p>

<p>The game was taken offline over the weekend after seemingly being caught up in a TikTok ban, which was rendered temporary when now-President Trump <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared a temporary reprieve</a> of 75 days for the social media platform. Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the outage was "a surprise" and that it "wasn't planned".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> shared on social media platform X today, Second Dinner confirmed the app was back online in the US, although it still <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881558007831740708" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem to be available</a> to download from mobile app stores.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the game's current publisher is Nuverse, a gaming-related subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance. Last year, ByteDance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bytedance-selling-gaming-assets" rel="nofollow">reportedly expressed interest</a> in selling off its gaming assets, which would naturally include Nuverse.</p>

<p>At time of writing, in-app purchases are <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881539047501484050" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently still down</a> within&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, but you can make purchases on the web shop. Second Dinner has <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previously stated</a> that it's "committed to ensuring that all players are compensated for their lost time" due to the outage.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a competitive card game currently available across PC and mobile devices. The game is described by its devs as a "fast-paced collectible card game that reimagines the genre with innovative mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's usually available on mobile devices as well, although reports suggest it's not downloadable on those storefronts right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Or months ago, maybe. I don't know and I have no time to check, because I'm playing the Steam demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-king-is-watching">The King Is Watching</a>. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-king-is-watchings-free-demo-turns-city-building-into-a-brilliant-balancing-act-of-feudal-surveillance">wrote about it</a> last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a>remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research. Here's a trailer to help:</p>

<p>I'm actually starting to suspect I might have imagined the build I last played, since the trailer I used in the previous article shows the newer build. How far down does this thing go? Wait, nevermind. It's still <a href="https://hypnohead.itch.io/the-king-is-watching">on Itch</a>. Typical deep state shenanigans. First up, this version is much more visually lively than the previous. You can see your king now, and he's wearing a glorious golden face mask. This is just the demo king though - there looks to be more monarchs with more problems in the full release. Also new are prophecies that let you choose the next three waves that attack you, with more difficult enemies granting better rewards. Also, I think there are a lot more upgrades now. This is useless. I'm being useless. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry. Don't look at me, look at this helpful and attractive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/">Steam description</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sire! There are countless reports of peasants and workers sleeping on the job, not producing the bare minimum for the kingdom to operate! Only your watchful eye can help them understand the importance of working, for the good of the Kingdom! Your Royal Skill of balancing resource production, troop training, and magic guild is what will save our kingdom! Avert your attention to other royal matters, and production will stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>See, that was illuminating. I'll have worked out what's new and what's good by the time I end up reviewing this thing, promise. It's "coming soon" currently. The me is watching. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">State Of Videogaming 2025 report</a> that "some gamemakers hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."</p>
<p>Picked up by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-is-hope-that-gta-6-will-cost-as-much-as-100-says-analyst/">VGC</a>, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the <a href="https://x.com/Phant0mSl0th/status/1881476885252891029">extremely</a> <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1881519478674239986">polarised</a> mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive">aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation</a>, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">mass livelihood devastation</a>, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.</p><!--more-->
<p>Having quote-tweeted the VGC article with the caption "You're not supposed to say this out loud!!!!", Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881030119793299652">added</a> that "a good company raises salaries in line with inflation so that their staff don't die or something, but games prices haven't risen with inflation.</p>
<p>"This isn't the reason the industry is in the shit for now, but it is an uncomfortable truth," he went on. "On the other hand, the responsibility for a game developer is to make sure that the game they show lives up to that promise, and that investment from the player."</p><p>Another user objected that while GTA 6 might get away with such a hike, that's unlikely to be true of most games. "That is indeed the problem," Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881034274566242724">replied</a>, adding that digital distribution has long since done away with the checks on game availability imposed by brick-and-mortar retailers. "We are at a strange moment where retail is not defining output &amp; content, but now nobody is," he went on. "There's no standard. It's difficult to parse. It's 'the wild west'. The point is that perhaps Rockstar have enough clout to lay down the new law. And with that others will sink or swim?"</p>
<p>Douse offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">similar arguments last August</a> in response to the pricing of Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, commenting of a potential broad price increase that "everyone's just waiting for GTA6 to do it lol."</p>
<p>I bundled together a few thoughts of my own in that last article, which I will now summarise: yes, the cost/price ratio for games of GTA's scale doesn't seem healthy, but the people who benefit from price increases aren't necessarily the company's developers (let alone outsourcing teams in places with fewer labour protections), because a lot of the moolah naturally goes to investors. </p>
<p>Raising the upfront price could mean that publishers don't have to resort to other ways of monetising games, such as insidious or outright predatory microtransactions, but as Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881127198024953955">concedes</a>, it's unlikely publishers of $100 games would piously scale back on their monetisation, because publishers will always want to make more money. Whatever it costs to begin with, GTA 6 will doubtless launch alongside a new incarnation of GTA Online, with all the seasonal DLC elements you'd expect.</p><p>Wash that down with the tepid armchair anti-capitalist observation that the publishers of "triple-A" games have long since locked themselves into an understanding of their art that requires them to defy gravity. The fixtures and flourishes must always be shinier, more lustrous, more lifelike; the space must always be larger and richer with shows of technological investment; the numbers must always go up. The industry's commitment to generative AI, aka fancy automation software, is one of many efforts to get around the problem that you can only employ so many people to create productions of this scale, assuming it isn't an active attempt to butcher the workforce.</p>
<p>I suspect that quite a lot of developers, even those who are relatively senior at companies like Take-Two, would love to get away from this thinking, but the most vocal, if not largest portion of their audience now insist upon it, having been taught to think this way by years of marketing (and by years of video game press like myself broadly acceding to marketing's cultural priorities). Sometimes I think that the only way out of the jam is some kind of full-on industry collapse that performs a broad reset, though the more constructive option is perhaps <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5572/The-Videogame-Industry-Does-Not-ExistWhy-We-Should">to stop thinking in terms of "industries" full stop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Users were even able to wishlist the game on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inevitably, Sony pulled Grand Taking Ages VI from the PlayStation Store, but now it’s back on Steam after what its creators said were key adjustments made to convince Valve of the project's validity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/slop-1737462004799.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages is back, this time on Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Violarte told IGN that Grand Taking Ages had been through a “thorough” review process, and was now approved for publishing on Steam. On the Steam page are a brand new trailer and updated screenshots, all leaning on the parody angle its developer is using as justification for the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s changed? As well as ditching the “VI” in the game title, Violarte changed the game’s logo, descriptions, and overall presentation “to clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.” Gone is the art that looked a lot like Rockstar’s iconic GTA imagery, in its place art that looks a <em>bit</em> like Rockstar’s iconic GTA imagery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Grand Taking Ages is still riddled with generative AI. As per Steam’s AI rules, Violarte disclosed on the Grand Taking Ages Steam page that it used "AI services" for voice overs — and a cursory glance at the trailer will demonstrate how well this worked out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the new description on the Grand Taking Ages Steam page:</p><blockquote>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in mom's garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of "creative" deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into... a slightly better garage!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Violarte said it took a different approach with Valve to get the game on Steam than it did with Sony to get the game on the PlayStation Store. “We approached Steam differently by engaging with their team about the concept of our game before officially submitting it,” a representative told IGN. “This allowed us to get their perspective early on, ensuring alignment with their guidelines.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company pointed to other projects such as Grand Theft Hamlet, a documentary about two out of work actors who attempt to put on a production of Hamlet inside GTA Online, as evidence that parodies of GTA should be protected from takedowns. “These examples showcase how parody can celebrate and entertain within existing genres while remaining creative and engaging,” Violarte said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/slop-again-1737462058393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages uses generative AI for its trailer voice over.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Violarte now wants Grand Taking Ages back on the PlayStation Store. “We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store,” it said. To that end, Violarte said it had sent a request to Sony that points out that the changes it’s made to the game have convinced Valve to approve it for release on Steam. “We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented,” Violarte said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages's appearance on the PlayStation Store called Sony’s curation process into question, but Valve’s open-door policy on Steam is well-documented. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop, and, increasingly, generative-AI is being used to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

TikTok owner ByteDance owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-snap-has-also-been-banned-in-the-us-following-the-tiktok-shutdown">so the game was also taken down but took a little longer to come back online</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Snap Card Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Marvel Snap is back online in the U.S," Second Dinner said. "But to make sure this never happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for Marvel Snap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than answers. We appreciate your patience, but in the meantime enjoy playing Marvel Snap. We’ll continue to update with more information as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Snap arrived in 2022 as a fast-paced TCG featuring the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, and many other Marvel superheroes and villains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-snap-review">In our 8/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Marvel Snap packs bold ideas, deep gameplay, a punchy presentation and lots of love for Marvel. Its approach to building a collection and randomness in gameplay won't be for everyone, but it's still well worth playing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-456-coming-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6435096/">as PS4 and Xbox One versions of Resident Evil 6 were released back in 2016</a>. The re-release came with all previously released add-on content, and in 2019, a Nintendo Switch version of the game was also released.</p><p>Resident Evil 6 is seen as the black sheep of the mainline franchise, as its attempt to be both a survival-horror and a survival-action game were met with mixed reception when it was first released in 2012. An over-reliance on distracting quick-time events and poorly executed scripted events did not sit well with audiences at the time, and over a decade later, the game still isn't fondly remembered.</p><p>Fortunately, Capcom's back-to-basics approach with the next mainline Resident Evil game helped kick off a new golden age for the franchise. Resident Evil 7 is still one of the scariest games in the series, while the remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 were praised for bringing the classic games into the modern era.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">The Resident Evil 4 remake earned a rare perfect score</a> at GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/">and Resident Evil Village received a highly positive reception</a> upon release.</p>

                <p>Epic's battle royale game Fortnite has introduced numerous licensed characters over the years, and the latest could be the classic Fox character Hank Hill from the animated series King of the Hill.</p><p>FNBRintel was first to report about the Fortnite X King of the Hill crossover that is said to be in the works, though a partnership has not been officially announced as of yet. King of the Hill was a popular show through its run in the late '90s and 2000s, and a revival of the show is coming to Hulu as soon as this year. As such, it makes a lot of sense that Hank could come to Fortnite in a cross-promotional effort.</p><p>Hank wouldn't be the first big Fox animated character to come to Fortnite, as Peter Griffin from Family Guy--the muscly version of the character, at least--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-peter-griffin-fortnite-leak-has-fans-thrilled/1100-6519637/" data-ref-id="1100-6519637">added to Fortnite in 2023.</a> Fox's most popular animated show, The Simpsons, hasn't had a Fortnite crossover as of yet.</p><p>Hank, voiced by Mike Judge, is the main protagonist of King of the Hill, which Judge created. Hank is a big fan of <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Strickland_Propane" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">propane and propane accessories</a> and <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Alamo_Beer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drinking Alamo beer with his friends.</a> He's a non-combative and subdued man, so it'll be interesting to see how he plays in Fortnite, if he is indeed coming.</p><p>Fortnite's latest crossover character is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">Godzilla, who is now in the game.</a> For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">everything you need to know about Godzilla in Fortnite.</a></p>
