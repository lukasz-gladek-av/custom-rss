            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sgf-2024-big-games-no-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The opening presentation for 2024's Summer Game Fest is due to air later this week, and host Geoff Keighley has taken to Twitch ahead of the show to set the record straight on what you should (and shouldn't) expect.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a>, Keighley fielded questions from excited gamers about which games would be appearing at the show, whether there would be any big reveals or surprises, and more.</p>

<p>If you're expecting major tentpole games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced"><em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to appear at the show, then Keighley says you'll be disappointed. None of those games will be part of SGF 2024, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=h0kgC67u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=ppi_g2NM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>fans, but&nbsp;<em>Delta&nbsp;</em>won't be shown during the SGF 2024 opening show.</figcaption></figure><p>Several fans asked Keighley about other games, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-among-us-2-new-screenshots">recently-resurfaced</a>&nbsp;<em>The Wolf Among Us 2&nbsp;</em>and Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, but Keighley said neither game will be appearing during the showcase.</p>

<p>These no-shows tie into another question that a fan asks Keighley, namely whether SGF and The Game Awards are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead">replacing E3</a>. Keighley says this isn't the case, and given the apparent lack of major showstopping announcements during this year's Summer Game Fest opener, it's hard to disagree.</p>

<p>Although there may not be any major reveals, Keighley says there will be shadowdrops during the presentation, and he also says that we should get to hear about some games we didn't already know about, which is always nice.</p>

<p>However, Keighley points to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs">industry-wide layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">studio closures</a> as proof that the industry in general has been struggling recently, which could be one of the reasons we're not getting quite as many big names at SGF this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=KQT4aYk1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=fvU6EQfH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several high-profile studios have been closed down in recent months.</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1797506575818797291" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that the Summer Game Fest show itself will be around 2 hours long, and that it'll be followed by a Day of the Devs show, with Devolver Direct following on immediately after that.</p>

<p>During SGF 2024, we can expect to see a mixture of new game reveals and games we already knew about, although Keighley says the show will focus mainly on existing games, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gameplay-characters"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's worth watching Keighley's full Q&amp;A session, as he's got some interesting tidbits to share not only about SGF itself, but also about some of the other presentations you might see during the summer period. Stay tuned for all the big (or otherwise) SGF announcements as and when we get them.</p>

Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166879/sony-psvr2-pc-support-adapter-certification-filing">a certification revealed that Sony was working on the adapter</a>, which would add PC support to the PS5-exclusive headset, the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">officially unveiled the connector</a>. It launches on August 7th and will cost $59.99.</p></div><p>Sony says the device will support all Steam VR games, including big-name titles like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>. In addition to the new adapter, Sony says players will need a DisplayPort cable to work with Steam titles on PC. (As well as a Steam account, obviously.) You can check out the minimum system requirements <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">right here</a>.</p><p>In a blog post, Sony explains that there will be some feature differences depending on whether you’re playing on PS5 or PC:</p><div><blockquote><p>PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 — so you’ll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC. However, other high-fidelity and sensory immersion features of PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sony originally confirmed PC support was coming to the device <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079928/sony-psvr2-pc-support-2024">back in February</a>, which would allow PSVR 2 owners to connect the device to a PC to play non-PlayStation games. At the time, it didn’t reveal any timing beyond a vague 2024. That reveal came almost exactly a year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">after the headset launched</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An artist is working on an unofficial The Legend of Zelda NES remake within Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>YouTuber and digital artist '<a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LloydEmpty">Lloyd Empty</a>' is working on his own fan remake of the original The Legend of Zelda within Epic's most recent gaming engine, and although this is a work-in-progress, this early footage shows promise. The art style is comparable with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-as-good-as-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019's Link's Awakening Remake</a> for the Nintendo Switch, and in all honesty, it looks quite great.</p>
<p>According to the French artist, in order to create this remake, he used Blender, Gimp, and FMOD (and of course, Unreal Engine). Those who've played the original NES game from 1986 will surely recognize the footage.</p>
<p>We've included the new gameplay footage of this The Legend of Zelda NES fan remake below. Be sure to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda Nes Remake Gameplay Beta v0.7.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wywTYTFJA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two years ago, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdfCaPKHm6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artist already released footage</a> of a playable beta, but as far as we know, this beta hasn't been released publicly. Whether a full release will ever be made available for the public is unclear.</p>
<p>Released in 1986 for the original NES, The Legend of Zelda is considered as one of the most influential games ever created. The game was ported to various other Nintendo platforms and is currently available on the Nintendo Switch as part of Nintendo Switch Online. Although we don't have exact numbers, the first entry in the Zelda series has sold well over 6 million copies.</p>
<p>In case you're into these Unreal Engine-remakes of Zelda entries, be sure to check out this <a href="https://wccftech.com/ocarina-of-time-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UE5 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, which looks astonishing in Epic's engine complete with water physics and more.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset will finally become usable on PC soon, thanks to an official adapter that will be released in a few months.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC adapter</a>, which will be released for an estimated retail price of $59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99 at select retailers and PS Direct on August 7th, will also require a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4 as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum system requirements, which are not particularly high, although for the best results, Sony recommends an RTX 3060 or Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card. Setup also promises to be painless, as users will only be required to connect the headset to a PC and then download the<br>
PlayStation VR2 App and SteamVR App from Steam.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using the PlayStation VR2 headset on PC won't deliver the same experience as on PlayStation 5 since some of its key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking and adapting triggers, and haptic feedback, won't be supported. However, 4K visuals, a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering, will be supported.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch on August 7th worldwide. You can learn more about the headset and some of its unique features in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>

Eddie Brock and his symbiote partner in crime Venom are shown beating up (and eating) baddies just like they always have. But it’s clear the third movie is going to escalate not once, but twice, as Eddie and Venom’s antics have caught the attention of some government forces and they’re forced to become fugitives But that’s the least of their worries, as aliens from Venom’s home planet have also come to Earth in pursuit of the duo. There’s a whole fight scene between the two and a real ugly beastie on top of of a plane. So it seems like these aliens will make their getaway plans a bit more complicated.</p><p>A lot of the dialogue in the trailer and the movie’s title makes it sound like this could be the last <em>Venom </em>movie, but given that these are the only movies Sony has been putting out in its store brand MCU knock-off that do well in the only way studio suits understand (money), I’d be surprised if that ends up being the case. But whatever happens to the <em>Venom</em> franchise, at least <em>The Last Dance </em>will give us a sick scene of Tom Hardy riding a symbiote horse. That’s fun.</p><p> The real question is: how much do we think <em>The Last Dance </em>will bring up Eddie and Venom’s cameo in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860"><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a></span>? There’s a shot in the trailer of what looks like Chiwetel Ejiofor’s character retrieving the piece of symbiote left at the end of that movie, which I would have thought would have far-reaching effects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but now I’m curious if it will close that thread. It was a real fucking bummer that Tom Hardy spent that entire movie nowhere near the plot, and if <em>The Last Dance </em>ends up essentially erasing that from the MCU, that would be a shame. We’ll find out if that little detour had any real tangible effect on Eddie and Venom’s life when <em>The Last Dance </em>premieres on October 25. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirts pre-orders for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One will be going live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new turn of events, we see one of PlayStation’s titles come over to Xbox instead of the other way around. Ember Labs is releasing Kena: Bridge of Spirits on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One physically and digitally on August 15, 2024. The devs are collaborating with <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1797614812706271484/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Maximum Entertainment Retail</a> for the physical release, which provides the player with some bonus content. Xbox hasn’t provided a price tag for the game yet, but we should expect pre-orders at major retailers to go live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, through the physical copy, players can expect the base game, along with some bonus content. An official soundtrack and retail exclusive sticker sheet are available to add to your collection. In terms of in-game cosmetics, players can explore the world of the game while rocking a Unique Kena Staff and Golden Rot skins. Also, to celebrate the launch on the new platform, players will see an Xbox Exclusive pirate-themed Rot hat to claim too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a narrative-focused adventure. You play the role of a young Spirit Guide called Kena, who has set foot on a detailed journey towards the sacred Mountain Shrine. Along the way, you find trapped spirits that need to be rescued with the help of Rot. Rot is your cute companions that help you surpass various obstacles in your journey. Furthermore, the game also includes enjoyable, fast-paced combat, with some light platforming and engaging boss fights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be released in 2021 for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a>, along with PC via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kena-bridge-of-spirits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Epic Games Store.</a> Similar to what we have seen with other PlayStation titles such as Sifu, Stray, and Deathloop, to name a few, the game was a timed exclusive.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1797629397777948847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Sony announced that the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will officially launch on August 7, 2024.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding blog</a> from PlayStation, Sony also mentioned that the anticipated PC adapter will have an estimated retail price of $59.99. It will be available “at select retailers and direct.playstation.com where available.”</p>



<p>This news shortly follows reports of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s certification license</a> for the adapter, which surfaced last week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s blog also reveals what users will need for the adapter. This includes a DisplayPort cable that works with DisplayPort 1.4, a Steam account, and a PC that meets minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Some of those requirements will include 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100, and a USB direct connection. And although the adapter was built for PlayStation 5, some key features are absent when you play on PC. Some examples include headset feedback and adaptive triggers.</p>



<p>The blog further warned fans that “performance may vary depending on your PC setup” and individual SteamVR title requirements.</p>



<p>In August, the new PlayStation PC adapter will give fans access to Steam’s extensive library of VR games. That includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx, Fallout 4 VR, and more.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sony also held a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> that teased over a dozen games coming to the PlayStation 5.</p>

                <p>If you were hoping to see one last surprise at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6521816/">Summer Game Fest Live</a>, Geoff Keighley has some bad news for you: What you see is what you get. In a <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent stream</a>, the host acknowledged that while a last surprise is often a tradition at game showcase events, this year's SGF will not have one.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not really one of those shows," Keighley explained. "Our shows don't typically have that." He noted that neither Gamescom Opening Night Live nor The Game Awards (two events that he's known for hosting) do not feature those sort of "bonus" announcements. However, he did say that the organizers put "a lot of thought" into the order of the reveals and trailers, from the first game to the last game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2Clscn0Jg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He then cited a humorous example, saying that those who expect Gabe Newell to walk out at the end and announce Half-Life 3 will be disappointed. "It'd be cool, but it's not happening on this show," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Summer Game Fest 2024 will take place on Friday, June 7 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The show will now take the spot formerly held by E3, the long-running video game trade show once seen as the premier event in gaming, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-permanently-canceled/1100-6519882/">permanently canceled</a> last year. While we don't know much about the event, we do know that it will feature a full reveal of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a VR game. Tickets to the physical event in Hollywood Park (Los Angeles) <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0A00606BE397250D" rel="nofollow ">are still being sold</a>.</p>

The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.</p>

<p>The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>.

<p>When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Cyan Worlds has announced the release date of the Riven remake, set for June 25th, with the game being available on PC, Mac, Meta Quest 2, and Meta Quest 3. This complete overhaul of the classic 1997 game brings back many of the original creators to re-envision Riven for modern audiences. The original itself was the sequel to Myst and had built upon the foundations of that influential puzzle game too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riven Launch Trailer PC 16x9 4k FINAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LN1TQm942_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remake of Riven will have new content, such as additional puzzles and an expanded storyline beyond the original game. It will also feature an enlarged world encompassing environments like jungles and caverns across the game’s five islands, offering both familiar secrets for veteran players and fresh content for all players to enjoy. The flatscreen and VR versions of Riven are being developed concurrently to ensure a consistent experience across all platforms. The release date for PC and VR has been announced, but the console release date remains unconfirmed at this time.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2646460/view/4150709171067099848" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam over the weekend</a>, developer CampFire Studio and publisher Qooland Games announced that&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>sales reached a total of 100,000 in just 31 hours.</p>

<p>The two studios go on to say that the game reached the number two spot on Steam's global bestseller list in just four hours, and that after eight hours,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>was in "the top 1 position for paid games worldwide".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-sales-100k-art.jpg?itok=fPGU6jU1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-sales-100k-art.jpg?itok=l8QgO3g1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>has already hit a pretty impressive sales milestone, and it's not showing signs of stopping.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Soulmask</em>'s devs also say they've reached the number one spot in paid game sales across the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, and Brazil, which is pretty darn impressive.</p>

<p>CampFire and Qooland also point to&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s 80% Very Positive review rating on Steam, with the two studios saying they're "immensely grateful" for the support and pledging to "do our utmost to improve the quality of&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>" in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>The game's meteoric rise has been impressive indeed.&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter">released on Friday</a>&nbsp;and quickly found itself climbing the Steam player charts, attracting a peak of almost 17,000 players within a few short hours.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game's 24-hour player total, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2646460/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to SteamDB</a>, stood at 38,746, which is also its all-time peak player count. Suffice it to say this one's not going away any time soon.</p>

<p>The game offers a "vast world" to explore, with plenty of different biomes to discover and creatures to fight. It's in Early Access right now, where the devs say it will remain "for one year at least".</p>

            <p>
Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/e3-is-officially-dead-say-esa">the death of E3</a>, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

</iframe> </p>
</figure>
<p>
During the session, Keighley confirmed that a lot of games wouldn't be on show. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will not by shown, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is also off the table, as is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wolf-among-us-2">The Wolf Among Us 2</a>. Neither should we expect anything about upcoming BioShock-like shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, nor anything on future <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> games. Keighley contrasted the Summer Game Fest with his other big show, The Game Awards, which is normally the place for reveals, he says.
</p>
<p>
"[The] Game Awards has a lot of usually big surprises - we're thankful for those - and big, new reveals. This [Summer Game Fest] is largely focused on announced stuff...
</p>
<p>
"There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like 'coming in 2026' or '2027', or teasers for games that are years and years out... That's generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting."
</p>
<p>
It makes sense that the largest reveals will not automatically flock to Keighley's flag, given the splintered state of the summer games bonanza in recent years. Even before E3 itself was entirely dissolved, many publishers have been hosting their own events in which bigger announcements are traditionally made. 
</p>
<p>
Keighley did highlight some games that would make an appearance, however, including dino-punching hunt 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: Refantazio</a>, the upcoming fantasy JRPG from the creators of Persona. So that's something! It's worth noting that Geoff's Jambalaya is followed by indie-focused showcases such as Day of the Devs and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolvers-e3-showcase-was-again-a-highlight-in-an-underwhelming-year">historically excellent</a> Devolver Digital Direct.

            <title><![CDATA[Riven Preview - Everything Old is New Again]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again.888054/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a solid 27 years since the release of <em>Riven</em>, the adventure follow-up to the much-acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/myst-remake-xbox-and-pc-release-confirmed"><em>Myst</em></a>. Like <em>Myst</em>, <em>Riven</em> is about to see a remake of its own, bringing the original up to scratch using the current generation graphics technology of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>It’s not an easy task – the original <em>Riven</em> has a lot of history behind it, and as such, expectations need to be set properly in place. <em>Riven</em> is important to its developer, Cyan, who had used the resources Myst provided to really tell a story. To them, they wanted <em>Riven</em> to feel like Lord of the Rings to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/realmyst-masterpiece-edition-pc-review"><em>Myst</em></a>’s Hobbit.</p>

<p>After watching the technology change over the years, and their ability as a company, Cyan felt the time was right to do a revisit to <em>Riven</em> justice.</p>

<p>The goal was simply this: let’s make a 3D version of the original <em>Riven</em> without messing with anything. But then, the team started questioning things and realizing they could change things to make them more coherent. Thus, the changes made had to make sense. It was a meticulous process, but not one done from a corporate standpoint. This was done for the fans.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=Ggy8q8Nt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=grqJmJJp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With Unreal Engine 5 at their fingertips, Cyan was afforded a lot of freedom. Whilst the game is 3D, there is an optional 2D and VR mode, with mobile VR also supported throughout.</p>

<p>We had a chance to attend a preview presentation showing off a little bit of the game, as well as take our own turn exploring for ourselves with a special demo build ahead of <em>Riven</em>’s just-announced release date of June 25.</p>

<p>The demo begins with a cutscene, and you, the player character of sorts, are given a mysterious book. This book seems to be important for some reason or another, so it’s best to pay attention. Paying attention is a key aspect of <em>Riven</em> after all.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that things aren’t exactly the same as the original <em>Riven</em>, so for those old fans, rest assured that things have been added for good reason. Expect little details from the start, such as items on the desk in the opening scene. These details are meant for continuity and story reasons prevalent throughout <em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>This was done so that old players can hopefully get a clue that this isn’t just the same game – it’s a chance to look at it with fresh eyes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=B4o91D3_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=FAvoSiWm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the demo continues, you’re thrown in jail immediately, and a man speaks to you in an unknown language. He takes the book you were given and seems excited about it, but his joy is short-lived as he falls and drops the book. Another person appears and sets you free, but not without taking the book with them.</p>

<p>At the jump, with free roaming now available, it’s important for original players to avoid assuming this is the same <em>Riven</em>. Details from the original may have changed and little things like this are part of the enhanced narrative.</p>

<p>Specifically, a lot of effort went into delineating the different areas while still maintaining the visual feeling of the original <em>Riven</em>. So, while there are those changes, the main essence is the same.</p>

<p>For example, you can look through portals and see a bit more than what you could before, and areas with a window to the outside are visible from the exterior.</p>

<p>Exploring around the cliff face in the demo, we eventually come upon a golden room, and outside of it, there is a button you can press to sort of spin it around to open up other places. The room itself has a reason for being there, and the main challenge is figuring out how to use the room to advance through the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=qBYUjRIc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=9SrbJeYj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s a lot more attention to detail throughout this remake, as is the essence of <em>Riven</em>. You can find little daggers, for example, that might suggest some rebels are trying to draw your attention to something. Maybe they’ll help you get around a locked door – it’s important to examine everything you can.</p>

<p>On the presentation side of things, there are a lot of sounds and performances that carried over from the original <em>Riven</em>, including some of the original voice actors. The level crafted in Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, and the modeling of the rockery and textures are detailed throughout.</p>

<p>It’s these details that allow you to be more observant, which can certainly help when things don’t go the way you expect them to. Be sure to pay attention to what you interact with as the ability to look around in real time is encouraged. It's also noteworthy to express just how relaxing moving around the world of <em>Riven</em> feels to be. You can spend a lot of time just taking in the details, or taking out your journal and reading some of the entries found within. It seems like there will be a lot more to uncover on the narrative side of things in the full release.</p>

<p>While we’re not able to check out the VR capabilities for <em>Riven</em>, the team at Cyan has told us that there will be comfort settings available including a snap camera, teleporting to different areas, smaller windows in some enclosed areas, and even environment settings.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=2TRJZESM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=8vYoJpg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The default settings should be comfortable, and there are further accessibility settings overall for things like colorblindness, and a lot of other considerations the team tried to address.</p>

<p><em>Riven</em> will be available for PC, Mac, and Meta Quest 2 and 3. Additional platforms will be forthcoming, but Cyan wasn’t able to say what those are quite yet. The playable demo featured in this preview will be available during the Steam Next Fest this month.</p>

It has upgraded battery life, RAM, storage, and a more ergonomically friendly chassis design, as well as improved cooling and connectivity.</p><p>Internally, you'll find a 1TB M.2 SSD, 24GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM, and a monstrous 80Wh battery alongside improved joysticks--rated for 5 million rotation cycles-- and a more precise D-pad. The PC gaming handheld will still be using a Z1 Extreme chipset and the same seven-inch 120Hz VRR screen, but these parts of the original model's design were lauded for offering a powerful gaming experience.</p><p>These changes have made it slightly heavier as it now weighs 678g, but alongside a custom cooling system, lighter circuit boards, and other improvements, the ROG Ally X is aiming to be a longer-lasting and more comfortable device to play your games on. Thanks to its design, the internal storage space can be upgraded easily, and the SD card reader has also been replaced. Hopefully, this will fix the issue of the ROG Ally randomly ejecting Micro SD cards.</p><p>Last year's ROG Ally was a great device when it first launched, even with several issues like the aforementioned poor battery life and its bad habit of weaponizing Micro SD cards. The Z1 Extreme version proved to be more than capable of running demanding games once you'd made a few graphical concessions, and in our own testing, we had titles like Marvel's Spider-Man, Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, and Forza Motorsport running very smoothly on it.</p><p>The other big plus was the adoption of a Windows operating system, which gives you more room to download your favorite games from a variety of digital marketplaces, like Steam, Ubisoft Connect, the Epic Games Store, and the Xbox store. If you have a Game Pass subscription, it's quite nice to have a massive library of games right out of the box. Admittedly, Windows on a small screen isn't the best to use, but in terms of performance, it runs pretty smoothly on the ROG Ally.</p><h2>Asus ROG Ally X specs</h2><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 11 Home</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme Processor: Zen 4 architecture, 8-core/16-thread (up to 5.1 GHz boost)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>AMD Radeon Graphics (AMD RDNA 3, 12 CUs, up to 2.7 GHz, up to 8.6 Teraflops)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>APU Power Draw</strong></td><td>9 to 30 Watts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>7-inch IPS panel (Glossy finish, 500 nits peak brightness, 7ms response time, touch screen)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1920x1080 @ 120 Hz refresh rate (AMD FreeSync Premium)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>24 GB LPDDR5X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD (2280)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ports</strong></td><td>1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack<br>1x Thunderbolt 4 support DisplayPort / power delivery<br>1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort / power delivery<br>1x UHS-II microSD card reader (supports SD, SDXC and SDHC)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>80WHrs, 4S1P, 4-cell Li-ion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Power Supply</strong></td><td>65W AC Adapter, Output: 20V DC, 3.25A, 65W Input: 100~240V AC 50/60Hz universal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>678 g / 1.49 lbs</td></tr></tbody></table>

                <p dir="ltr">The renewed interest in the Fallout franchise has led to one person playing the first game in the post-apocalyptic RPG series on a platform discontinued years ago: Nintendo 3DS. That's right, it's now possible--thanks to a mod--to visit the wasteland in its original form on the handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-first-game-3ds-mod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a> spotted that someone is playing through Fallout in a way that didn't seem possible. The RPG is technically only available on PC, without any sort of port on Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicfallout/comments/1d22ukh/finally_gonna_play_through_and_finish_fallout_1/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-first-game-3ds-mod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit user</a> transferred their "original, legally purchased copy" over to 3DS and says it's "running great." The only issue they've experienced is the fact you have to "cycle between left and right click with [the] L button."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/03/kena-bridge-of-spirits-guides-players-to-xbox-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.</p>

<p>As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/22/kena-bridge-of-spirits-anniversary-update-out-next-month-alongside-steam-debut">Anniversary DLC update</a>, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kena-bridge-of-spirits/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-one-of-the-best-adventures-of-the-year">his review,</a>&nbsp;"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits." The game was also a sales success, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/25/kena-bridge-of-spirits-has-already-recouped-its-development-costs">recouping its development costs</a> a month after its initial release in September 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="430" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Larian Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in a Community Update</a> on Steam today that the already massive cRPG <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> will soon be getting even bigger with official mod support as part of Patch 7. The Patch will be split into two phases with the first beginning today in the form of a closed alpha for established mod authors in the community. In September Patch 7 will release publically adding the highly requested feature.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-a-universe-of-possibilities-for-baldur-s-gate-3-via-mods" data-injectable="false">A universe of possibilities for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> via mods</h2> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Even though you can technically download and install mods in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> today, the process is a bit monotonous, especially for those not familiar with modding. Official mod support will streamline the process while also improving compatibility across the various platforms you can play <em>BG3</em> on.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">Support will be implemented via Mod.Io, a popular modding solution that allows developers to integrate modding into their title in a more managed format, allowing the mods to be downloaded and utilized on a variety of platforms.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">At first, modding will launch on PC via Steam with support coming to Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox shortly after.</p> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">The Patch 7 update will also implement the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Toolkit which will enhance the modding process for modders and players alike with the following features:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Access the editor to create your own mods.</li> <li>Upload mods directly to mod.io servers.</li> <li>Load levels read-only to look at all the local entities, as well as the setup, and test your mods in-game while creating them.</li> <li>Get access to our internal editors for supported asset types such as textures and visual models, allowing you to override them directly in your mod through the developer interface.</li> <li>Publish your mod via the editor where it will be moderated and made visible in the in-game browser, or pack your mod locally to upload to a third-party site.</li> <li>Mod UIs through file editing. We will provide documentation that will explain how our internals are set up to solve mod loading/compatibility issues.</li> <li>Within Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, you’ll be able to: <ul> <li>Download and manage your mods directly.</li> <li>Manage multiplayer and save game files through a verification UI.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="false">The Patch 7 update for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 which will include official mod support but also implement new evil endings, bug fixes, and a trove of quality-of-life</em> improvements is set to release this September.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves.888033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="205" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crude Ring in Wuthering Waves is a vital resource. You will need it to level up characters, so prepare to get a lot of it, especially if you have multiple characters in your party who need it for upgrades.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">Crude Ring is used as an ascension material for Calcharo, Yangyang, Yanwu, and Danjin. At the moment, you do not need it for any weapons in the game.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-get-crude-ring" data-injectable="false">Where to get Crude Ring</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Crude Ring can be obtained in several ways. Some cost resources, while others are free. I always suggest farming these the free way, where possible, and saving resources for harder-to-get things. It just makes sense to hold on to resources as much as you can, especially when the item you want really isn’t very hard to get.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Farming from enemies</h2> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">You can farm Exile enemies anywhere on the map, and they have a chance to drop the Crude Ring on death. There are numerous types of Exiles in the game, and they are pretty standard human enemies.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false"> <li>Exile Leader – normally armed with dual blades and capable of channeling Electro energy.</li> <li>Exile Technician – a caster who can create shields for themselves and others and cast blades of damaging enemies.</li> <li>Standard Exiles – will be armed with either a melee weapon or a gun. They are not a very serious threat.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><strong>You can find Exiles all over the map, but they are quite common on the Central Plains, and the Desorock Highlands.</strong></p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Purchase from the weapon shop</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Crude Rings can also be purchased from the weapon shop in Jinzhou. The weapon store is found in the northeast of the city, near the Synthesis console. It will cost 1500 Shell Credits to buy Crude Ring, and there will be a limit to how many you can purchase each day. Getting your resources this way can get expensive quickly, so it is not really the best way to do things.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Purchase from the in-game store</h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Hands down, the worst way to get anything is to buy it from the in-game store. You really do not need to do this. You can spend 15 Oscillate Corals to get 5 Crude Rings, but it is absolutely not worth it. The inventory for this store also rotates, so they may not be available when you need them. If you are tempted to go this route, I implore you to just go farm some Exiles.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">An important note on Crude Ring is that you can use it at the Syntehsiser to make the higher ranked Rings at a rate of 3 to 1. So, you can use 3 Crude Ring to make a Basic ring, and so on. Keep that in mind as you get later into the game and need higher rarities of Ring for ascensions.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-arrive-with-patch-7-in-september.888006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian has announced that official&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools will arrive in September, as will everything else that's coming as part of the hotly-anticipated Patch 7.</p>

<p>We first learned that official mod support for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>would arrive as part of Patch 7 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-patch-7">back in April</a>, but we now know roughly when we can expect it, although no final release date has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>The closed alpha for mod support kicks off today, according to a&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update on Steam</a>, and another test will open up registrations in July, allowing Larian to work through player feedback for the rest of the summer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=e2YYe5xO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=WTTD3wh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools are just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned community update, Larian also sets out what mod tools and modding support will mean for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>right now, but implementing an official mod pipeline should make things much smoother and allow for better compatibility between each mod, as well as between mods and the game itself.</p>

<p>You'll still be able to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>outside of Larian's official system if you want to, of course. Modding will use the <a href="https://mod.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mod.io</a> platform and will be PC-only at first, but Mac support, as well as modding support for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, is on the cards too.</p>

<p>With that said, PlayStation and Xbox players won't have access to the&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod toolkit, so if you want to make your own mod for the game, you'll need to have a PC to do it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170373/venom-3-trailer-last-dance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ebiZue"><em>Venom 3</em>, cheekily subtitled the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23042540/el-muerto-bad-bunny-venom-3-ghostbusters-5-sony-cinemacon"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>, looks like a splashy payoff to one of the superhero movie era’s weirder franchises. Tom Hardy is back as Eddie Brock and on the run from some gun-toting scientists who believe the Venom symbiote must be eradicated for the sake of Earth. Crossing my fingers this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETPVU0acnrE"><em>The Fugitive</em></a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khVFiUShfR8"><em>Midnight Run</em></a> with a Venom horse.</p>
<p id="gkd7Z0"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em> appears to pick up where we left Eddie and Venom in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22701590/venom-2-review-let-there-be-carnage"><em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em></a>: lying low in the tropics after killing serial killer Cletus and leaving detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22691862/venom-2-blue-eyes-detective-toxin-marvel-symbiote">infected with his own symbiote</a>. But if you are a total dork about this stuff, you might be wondering: Hey, didn’t Eddie and Venom cross over into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22701094/venom-2-let-there-be-carnage-after-credits-scene">a post-credits tease at the end of <em>Let There Be Carnage</em></a>? Yes, they did! At least that’s what appeared to happen, a theoretical connection to Doctor Strange’s multiversal spell in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>. </p>
<p id="BzG3HE">But in the end, only Andrew Garfield’s and Tobey Maguire’s previous Spider-Mans showed up in the crossover movie — no Venom. In fact, Marvel went so far as to undo the whole tease. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22836376/spider-man-no-way-home-post-credits-scenes-venom-doctor-strange">A post-credits scene in <em>No Way Home</em></a> saw Eddie grumbling at a bar over his multiverse displacement, only to be immediately transported back to his walled-off Sony-Marvel timeline in a flash. Nothing mattered! Wild.</p>
<p id="AilrKq">So here we are, <em>The Last Dance</em>, with Eddie and Venom back where they started: on the run, biting heads, and amped for more black-goo hijinks. There are some <a href="https://comicbookmovie.com/venom/venom-let-there-be-carnage/venom-the-last-dance-rumored-plot-leak-claims-to-reveal-the-movies-villains-and-plans-forpeter-parker-a211156">out-there rumors on dubious corners of the internet</a> that Eddie might somehow might be on the hunt for a 10-year-old Peter Parker, but the trailer pretty much dispels the post-credits-inspired hope. We do get a tease of Mulligan’s transformation into Toxin, and while Chiwetel Ejiofor shows up as a big bad, he’s not playing Karl Mordo from <em>Doctor Strange</em> — just some dude in army fatigues who likely bonds with a symbiote for a final fight. <em>Ted Las</em>so<em>’s </em>Juno Temple is also in the cast, and is also rumored to do some symbioting. </p>
<p id="0HBa7S"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em>, which does not take place in the MCU timeline, is out on Oct. 25.</p>

Larian has a habit of releasing its games unfinished into the hands of its community, and it’ll be doing the same for Patch 7. At first this will be a “closed beta,” where a hand-picked group of the finest vintage of mod creators will be given access, with the intention that these amateur experts will help them iron out major issues and test the tech to see how it works with unofficial mods they’ve already built.</p><p>That all starts today, June 3, with more modders being let behind the secret door as the month goes on. But come July, the crack in the door widens slightly, and 1,000 members of the hoi polloi who register will be allowed through. Over the next couple of months, Larian and this motley crew of unpaid laborers will get things shipshape and hopefully released for the masses in September.</p><p>It’s a studio that certainly seems to understand why a community wants to be able to mod. The recent update states,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Whether you are turning fireballs pink, boosting the attack damage of a hand-wielded sausage, or bestowing all citizens of Faerûn with a personal handgun, modding lets you alter a game to change how it looks or behaves.</p></blockquote><p>More usefully, the mod tools will allow people to create new classes and subclasses, weapons and armor, spells and skins, and thus craft entire new approaches to the game. It’s a long-running tradition of <em>D&amp;D</em> games, especially those made by BioWare—and most especially <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>—to let the community then create their own stories within (and without) the Forgotten Realms, so it’s great to see it being supported this time too.</p><p>Larian is at pains to say that this doesn’t close down options for the unofficial modding scene that’s already established around <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, which they fully intend to endorse. This will also provide a way for mods that won’t get approval from the license owners to still be possible to create and share. The game will still recognize them and run them, but obviously they won’t be supported.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We understand and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the modding community, and have no plans to limit modding to our official pipeline. We are committed to supporting the modding community as comprehensively as we can, and can’t wait to see what ideas you bring to life!</p></blockquote><p>Larian certainly are saying all the right words here. Mods and modding will be launched first for PC via software called Mod.io, with Mac and consoles to follow at an unspecified time. However, mod <em>creation</em> will require a PC. </p><p>The update includes no new information regarding the forthcoming new endings we know are coming to the game, with Larian referring players back to April’s last <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4172097464031362567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4172097464031362567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Update</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is otherwise best known for creating the Uncharted franchise, though this was put to bed with 2016's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</a> and smaller follow-up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review">The Lost Legacy</a> a year later.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever.</p></div><p>Naughty Dog hasn't released a game since The Last of Us: Part 2 beyond remasters, remakes, and collections, and while the studio confirmed it had decided on its next major title in March 2023, nothing is known about it externally.</p><p>Druckmann's comments suggest it may not be a new The Last of Us game, however, if he's certain Naughty Dog won't be predominantly known for the franchise in the future. It's also entirely possible The Last of Us is just one of these "multiple single player projects" in the works at Naughty Dog. Only time will tell.</p><p>Druckmann didn't say these projects were all in development either, but simply being worked on, meaning several, if not all, could still be in early conceptual phases and far from being worked on proper, never mind released. Projects this early in development are also regularly cancelled or drastically changed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Regardless, Druckmann did say Naughty Dog's incoming games would follow the same principles as the studio's previous. "We create experiences that are steeped in story and character, especially relationships," he said. "The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into."</p><p>These comments will hopefully not be retracted like another media appearance from Druckmann was, as in a bizarre turn of events, Naughty Dog owner <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-controversial-interview-with-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-after-finding-several-significant-errors-and-inaccuracies">Sony published and then deleted an interview with him</a> after several misquotes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-update">Myriad comments from Druckmann were published incorrectly</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-did-not-quite-say-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming">forcing him to release clarifying statements online</a>. "We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused," Sony said.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">reveal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why," Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. "I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a clip of it, too:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the "but you guys can keep hoping" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer</a>, and then read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2022/06/14/nomura-reveals-more-on-kingdom-hearts-iv-and-the-series-future-with"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura</a> about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series' future with Final Fantasy, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kena-bridge-of-spirits-xbox-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ember Lab has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>Xbox release is happening later this year, with the acclaimed action-adventure game set to debut on Microsoft's consoles in August.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, which debuted on PlayStation in 2021 before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kena-bridge-of-spirits-steam-release-and-anniversary-update-announced">hitting PC the following year</a>, will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One on August 15th.</p>

<p>The Xbox version of the game will, according to Ember Lab, feature Xbox-exclusive goodies, including "Xbox Exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats" and a unique staff for Kena.</p>

<p>Ember Lab COO Josh Grier says the studio is "thrilled" that&nbsp;<em>Kena&nbsp;</em>is heading to Xbox, and that the new platforms represent the chance to "share Kena's journey with more players". It's hard to argue with that.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, it's an action-adventure game that draws on influences like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>; in fact, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbMQfaG6lo8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">viral&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-themed short film&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbMQfaG6lo8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terrible Fate</a>&nbsp;</em>was also created by Ember Lab.</p>

<p><em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits&nbsp;</em>has you playing as the titular Kena, a Spirit Guide in search of a sacred mountain shrine. As she searches for the shrine, she must also help the ghosts of a village trapped in the past to move on.</p>

            <p>Xbox owners will soon be able to get their hands on Kena: Bridge of Spirits.</p>
<p>The game is set to arrive on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 15th August, priced £34.99 on the Microsoft Store. It will come with exclusive pirate-themed hats for the Rots - the game's timid and elusive spirits - as well as a unique Kena Staff and a Golden Rot Skin (you can check out how the hats look in the video below).</p>

<p>Those on Xbox Series X will also be able to purchase a Premium physical edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, which will include a digital soundtrack and a retail exclusive sticker sheet.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game will also come with Kena: Bridge of Spirits' Anniversary DLC update, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kena-bridge-of-spirits-free-anniversary-update-adds-new-game-plus">arrived on PlayStation and PC back in 2022</a>. This update added New Game Plus as a major addition, as well as other additions such as equipable Charmstones that provided adjustments to stats and abilities.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to bring the story of Kena to a new audience on Xbox platforms," said Josh Grier, COO of the game's developer Ember Lab. "As our debut game, Kena means a great deal to everyone at the studio and the team is excited to share Kena's journey with more players  - we really hope everyone enjoys meeting Kena and her Rot friends!"</p>
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be available to pre-order both digitally and physically for Xbox "soon", the team said.</p>

<p>We described the game as "a gorgeous yet unoriginal adventure" in our original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-gorgeous-looking-yet-wholly-unoriginal">Kena: Bridge of Spirits review</a>.</p>
<p>"If you've played a decent number of games before," Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfeld wrote back in 2021, "it's likely you'll tire of the repetition of well-worn ideas here... This is a game that offers beautiful facsimiles of Zelda, Uncharted, The Pathless, and Pikmin that glide by through its 10 to 15 hour running time. But playing Kena gets very boring, very fast."</p>

			<p>We've finally arrived at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-june-date-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> week, and host Geoff Keighley has provided some advance info for fans <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a Twitch Q&amp;A</a>. To begin with, Keighley tried to temper expectations, saying there won't be many shocking announcements this year:</p>
<p><em>One of the things you'll see with the Summer Game Fest show this week is that we've really tried to program some unexpected things with smaller teams and independent studios alongside the sort of big blockbuster games and franchises that you will see in the show as well, but I think what's cool about our industry right now is that it's a great time where small games can really get significant success as we've seen. I think it's going to be a little bit quieter this Summer when it comes to crazy new announcements and shocking surprises and things like that. That's one of the things I always see online: the crazy speculation. Just like last week with the State of Play, people went in with crazy expectations. I see all this stuff, even around Summer Game Fest, and I think it's going to be a good, solid show, but we're not going to have a new GTA 6 trailer for you. I know sometimes when I see the feedback online people have lots of crazy that they get excited about. Hopefully, we will deliver on some of those things, but I'm sure many things we won't. Hopefully what happens is that people tune in and find something that surprises them.</em></p>
<p>Keighley also talked specifically about games that will or won't be at Summer Game Fest 2024. In the first category, gamers can expect to see a new Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 trailer, a new Metaphor: Refantazio trailer, a new Monster Hunter Wilds trailer, and a new Batman: Arkham Shadow trailer. On the other hand, don't get your hopes up to see Kingdom Hearts 4, Metal Gear Solid: Delta, The Wolf Among Us 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2024 will go live on Friday, June 7, at 2 PM Pacific Time across most platforms and social channels. It is expected to last around two hours.</p>

			<p>Ember Lab's <a href="https://emberlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a> will finally launch on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One in a few months, almost three years since its release on PlayStation consoles and PC.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X|S version of the action-adventure game will launch on August 15th worldwide, complete with some exclusive content such as the pirate-themed Rot hats, a unique Kena Staff, and a Golden Rot Skin.</p>
<p>In partnership with Maximum Entertainment, a physical Xbox Series X Premium Edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will also be released. It will include the Official Digital Soundtrack, a Retail-Exclusive Sticker Sheet, and the exclusive Xbox-themed content available in the digital edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release back in September 2021, Kena: Bridge of Spirits was updated the following year with additional content, such as a New Game Plus mode, new trials that further push the limits of some gameplay mechanics, and more. You can learn more about the Anniversary Update in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kena-bridge-of-spirits-anniversary-update-review-trials-of-the-mountain-shrine/"> review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Featuring new content that expands the game in some interesting ways and new trials that push the limit of the game's mechanics, the Kena: Bridge of Spirits Anniversary Update has a lot to offer to returning and new players alike. The new additions aren't particularly game-changing, so those who did not like the original release won't change their opinion with the new content. Those who loved the base game, however, will find a lot to like in the Anniversary Update.</em></p>
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4. It will launch on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One on August 15th.</p>

  <p id="WLkOr4">If you were to jump directly from the first episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107999/star-trek-discovery-season-5-preview"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a> to its finale — which just debuted on Paramount Plus — the whiplash would throw you clear out of your seat like your ship had suffered an inertial damper malfunction. Since its first two chapters premiered on CBS All Access in 2017, the series has moved to a different ship and a different century, and has acquired an almost entirely different set of characters. Moreover, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24119983/star-trek-progenitors-discovery-picard-chase"><em>Discovery</em></a> has received a radical tonal refit, evolving in fits and starts from a dark and violent war story to a much sunnier action-adventure serial. </p>
<p id="2Cu42h">Though it never won the mainstream attention or critical acclaim of its spinoff, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23755316/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-lanthanites-pelia-species-carol-kane"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a><em>,</em> nor the gushing fan adulation of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23620555/worf-star-trek-picard-season-3-michael-dorn-interview"><em>Picard</em>’s <em>Next Gen</em> reunion</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23345284/star-trek-tv-show-best-start"><em>Discovery</em> spearheaded Star Trek’s return to television</a>, the franchise’s maiden voyage into the frontier of premium streaming content. Like any bold pathfinder, <em>Discovery</em> encountered obstacles, suffered losses, and made some major course corrections. But, if you ask the cast and crew, the adventure has been more than worth the tumultuous journey.</p>
<h2 id="XtieQm"><strong>Tacking into the wind</strong></h2>
<p id="Ugaio7">“We were on wobbly legs for a long time,” admits star Sonequa Martin-Green, whose character, Michael Burnham, has had the rug pulled out from under her a number of times over the course of the series. In the first season and backstory alone, Burnham lost her parents, saw her mentor murdered, was tried for mutiny, discovered that her first love is a Klingon sleeper agent, and was betrayed by not one but two Mirror Universe doppelgängers of trusted Starfleet captains.</p>
<p id="R71ZFb">Move over, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23547617/deep-space-nine-star-trek-ds9-watch-analysis"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a> — this was instantly the grimmest canonical depiction of the Star Trek universe on screen. Season 1 of <em>Discovery</em> was rated TV-MA and featured more blood and gore than the franchise had ever seen, not to mention an instance of graphic Klingon nudity. (Actor Mary Wiseman recalls seeing her co-star Mary Chieffo walking the set wearing prosthetic alien breasts and thinking, <em>What the hell?</em>) The corpse of Michelle Yeoh’s character is cannibalized by Klingons off screen, and her successor, portrayed by Jason Isaacs, turns out to be a manipulative psycho from the Mirror Universe who tries to mold Burnham into his plaything.</p>

<p id="yTFYTX">The bleak, adult-oriented tone was not the only sticking point with Star Trek purists, as <em>Discovery</em> would take place a decade before the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> but have a design aesthetic much closer to that of the 2009 movie reboot, leading to some irreconcilable clashes with continuity. The show’s serialized, season-long arcs were a far cry from the familiar “planet of the week” stories of most previous incarnations of the franchise. Then there was Burnham’s backstory as the never-before-mentioned human foster sister to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824684/star-trek-spock-strange-new-worlds-actors">Trek’s iconic Vulcan Spock</a>, a creative decision that has “clueless studio note” written all over it. Even ahead of its debut, <em>Discovery</em> faced vocal opposition from the fan base for straying so far from their notion of what Star Trek was supposed to be. (Not to mention the revolting but quite vocal faction of fans who were incensed that Star Trek had “gone woke,” as if it hadn’t been that way the whole time.) Many of <em>Discovery</em>’s detractors flocked toward <em>The Orville</em>, a Fox series starring and created by Seth MacFarlane that was essentially ’90s-style Star Trek with the occasional dick joke thrown in. <em>The Orville </em>offered fans alienated by <em>Discovery</em>’s vastly different approach to Star Trek a more familiar (but far less ambitious) alternative. </p>
<p id="OeE52Z">The grim Klingon War story was the brainchild of co-creator Bryan Fuller, who had been a member of the <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Voyager </em>writers rooms before creating cult series like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22967661/pushing-daisies-bryan-fuller-genre-aids"><em>Pushing Daisies</em></a> and <em>Hannibal</em>. Fuller would end up <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/28/bryan-fuller-star-trek-discovery/">departing Team Discovery</a> before production even began, asked to resign after a string of creative differences with the studio. New showrunners Aaron Harberts and Gretchen J. Berg carried out a version of Fuller’s plans without him, and then oversaw the show’s first major pivot. <em>Discovery</em>’s second season was immediately brighter, more colorful, and cozier with established Star Trek lore. (This is the arc that would introduce <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23057405/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-creator-anson-mount-pike-masculinity">the versions of Pike</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/28/18245209/spock-star-trek-discovery-season-2-changes">Spock</a>, and Number One who now lead <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.) But things weren’t so sunny behind the scenes — <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-trek-discovery-showrunners-alex-kurtzman-take-1120416/">Harberts and Berg were fired</a> midway through the season after writers accused the duo of creating an abusive work environment.</p>
<p id="6unkV0">As different as <em>Discovery</em> would eventually stray from the HBO-style drama of its first season, co-creator Alex Kurtzman feels that the mission of the series has never changed. </p>
<p id="0IRyNW">“One of the things that we set up in season 1 is that we knew that Burnham would start as a mutineer and end up a captain,” says Kurtzman. “What was exciting about that is that we knew it would take time.”</p>

<p id="IrZcz7">It was after Harberts and Berg’s departure that Kurtzman, who had remained involved but been primarily occupied with the development of the growing television Star Trek franchise as a whole, took the helm of <em>Discovery</em> himself. Before long, he would promote writer and co-executive producer Michelle Paradise to the role of co-showrunner, which she would retain for the remainder of the series. Just as the late, great Michael Piller did during the third season of <em>The Next Generation</em>, Paradise brought a sense of stability and confidence to <em>Discovery</em>, which reverberated onto set.</p>
<p id="Z0YCgd">“I commend Michelle Paradise and the rest of the writers because this show <em>evolved</em>,” says Martin-Green. “Our initial showrunners, Aaron Harberts and Gretchen Berg, they made their impact and that’ll never be erased, but landing where we did with Michelle co-showrunning with Alex Kurtzman, jumping farther than any Trek had gone before, I feel that’s when our feet were solid on the ground and when we really established our identity.”</p>
<p id="Cb976A">Season 2 fell into a steady rhythm that felt more in tune with Kurtzman’s “movie every week” philosophy, never far in tone from the reboot film trilogy on which Kurtzman served as a writer and producer. The steady presence of Michelle Yeoh’s deliciously amoral Emperor Georgiou was a major boon, essentially becoming Star Trek’s answer to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23069583/buffy-spuffy-elysian-fields-fanfiction"><em>Buffy</em>’s Spike</a> or <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>’s Vegeta. However, <em>Discovery</em> was also undeniably borrowing clout from legacy characters Pike and Spock, and the constant friction with established canon wasn’t sitting well with Kurtzman or the audience.</p>
<p id="lBBM7E">The season ended with a surprising twist that resolved the continuity problems but also changed the entire nature of the show. The titular starship and its crew would be propelled 930 years into the future, past the furthest fixed point in Star Trek’s continuity. No longer forced to tiptoe around the sacred canon, <em>Discovery</em> was free to sprint in a bold new direction. Once again and in a more tangible way, it was a whole new show.</p>
<p id="7Z4xNc">“If the folks who came in had sort of taken us off the rails that would have been a very different experience,” says Anthony Rapp, who portrays the prickly Commander Paul Stamets. “But Michelle Paradise came through as such a shining light and a beautiful presence in our lives. She took the show into this territory of being able to have the heart in its center in a way that felt very grounded and meaningful, and really helped us to make that transition.”</p>

<p id="Qt68Bb">Season 3 of <em>Discovery</em> offered Kurtzman, Paradise, producing director Olatunde Osunsanmi, and the rest of the creative team <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107999/star-trek-discovery-season-5-preview">a rare opportunity to completely rewrite Star Trek’s galactic map</a>. Not since the launch of <em>The Next Generation</em> in 1987 had a writers room been able to venture onto such “fresh snow,” as Paradise puts it. In the 32nd century, beyond the furthest point explored in the established Trek canon, the righteous United Federation of Planets has all but collapsed in the aftermath of “the Burn,” a mysterious space calamity. Some longtime friends are now adversaries, and even Earth has become an isolationist state. The USS Discovery, displaced in time, becomes the means by which to reconnect the shattered galaxy. It’s not hard to read this as a mission statement for Star Trek as a whole — a relic from another time, back to offer hope to a bleak present.</p>
<p id="vCsiV0">Season 3’s 13-episode arc restored a bit of Star Trek’s space Western roots, with warp drive a rare and costly luxury in the ravaged 32nd century and half the galaxy dominated by a vast criminal empire known as the Emerald Chain. Michael Burnham spent much of the season out of uniform, having found a new purpose as a more roguish freelance courier alongside the sweet and savvy Cleveland Booker (David Ajala). This is arguably the most interesting version of the show, as Michael questions whether or not Starfleet — the institution whose trust she has worked so hard to restore — is still her home.</p>
<p id="QrdSe7">By the end of the season (and right on schedule with Fuller and Kurtzman’s original plans), Michael Burnham finally accepts her destiny and becomes captain of Discovery. More subtly, this altered the premise of the show for a third time, as the central question of “Will Michael ever become captain?” had been answered in the affirmative. But, since she’d already been the central character and a figure of improbable cosmic import, the change was mostly cosmetic. And symbolic — Martin-Green considers her presence “being Black, and a woman, and a captain sitting in that chair” to be her greatest contribution to Star Trek. After three seasons of struggle and uncertainty, Burnham could now be as aspirational a character as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957090/jean-luc-picard-romance-tng">Picard</a>, Sisko, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22870436/star-trek-prodigy-cameos-spock-uhura-kobayashi-episode">Janeway</a>.</p>
<p id="FGIWj8">The tone on which the show settled at the end of season 3 would be the one that finally stuck. Where the series had initially been bloody and brooding, it was now squarely an adventure show featuring a cast of characters with a boundless and demonstrative love for each other. The crew would face mortal danger each episode and a galactic-level threat each season, bolstered by very expensive-looking visual effects and a rousing score. At the same time, many conflicts both large and small would eventually be resolved by characters talking through their feelings and finding common ground. This was exhausting as often as it was compelling, but it was consistent. For its final two seasons, viewers could finally know what to expect from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>.</p>
<h2 id="EGuRvE"><strong>Discovering itself</strong></h2>
<p id="V1bjxn"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions">This “feelings over phasers” approach</a> was not for everyone, but it was never intended to be. Even from the outset, before Paramount began pumping out more Star Trek series to target different facets of the fan base, <em>Discovery</em> was never meant to be a definitive Star Trek experience that checked every box.</p>
<p id="SPj4Dq">“You’ll never be able to be everything to everybody,” says Michelle Paradise. “The goal was always to make the best version of <em>Discovery</em>. It’s a different kind of Star Trek. It’s serialized, it’s fewer episodes, it’s a movie every week. That’s a thing that will appeal to many people, and for some people it won’t be their cup of tea.”</p>

<p id="CZZ4WU"><em>Discovery</em> has bounced up and down my personal ranking of Star Trek series a number of times during its run, more than any of its past or present siblings. I have begun each season of the show with great excitement, and that excitement is frequently exhausted by season’s end. Most Trek series have good years and bad years. To me, <em>Discovery</em> suffers from being simultaneously brilliant, innovative, lazy, cringe, inspiring, and eye-rolling at all times, only in different measures. It features the franchise’s strongest lead actor since Patrick Stewart, and a supporting cast that has never been leveraged to my satisfaction. In my career, I have written more words about <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> than any other television series, and I still haven’t made up my mind about it. For as many cheerleaders and haters as the show must have, I imagine there are many more viewers who feel the way I do — it’s a show that I wanted to love, but never fully fell in love with.</p>
<p id="V0r8GI">As <em>Discovery</em> disappears in the aft viewport, some will bid it a fond farewell, some will be blowing it raspberries, and some will turn away with total disinterest. But regardless of how well <em>Discovery</em> itself is remembered in the coming years, it has already made a substantial impact on the franchise. It paved the way for every Trek series that followed, including <em>three</em> direct spinoffs. Its second season was the incubator for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23799328/star-trek-kirk-spock-snw-strange-new-worlds"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>, now the most acclaimed Trek series in a generation. Michelle Yeoh had such fun in her recurring role on <em>Discovery</em> that, even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23636975/oscars-2023-michelle-yeoh-best-actress-speech">after winning an Academy Award</a>, she was still <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23637514/star-trek-michelle-yeoh-section-31-show-release">keen to return for the upcoming <em>Section 31</em> TV movie</a>. <em>Discovery</em>’s 32nd-century setting will continue to be explored in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23663131/star-trek-starfleet-academy-show-paramount-plus-release">new <em>Starfleet Academy</em> series</a>, leaving the door open for some of its characters to return.</p>
<p id="F1TwWO">Even the new shows that have no direct relationship to <em>Discovery</em> have benefitted from the precedent it set by being different from what came before. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23735961/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-2-trailer-lower-decks"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> is an animated sitcom, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22753008/star-trek-prodigy-review-kate-mulgrew-janeway"><em>Prodigy</em> is a kid-targeted cartoon</a>, <em>Picard</em> is… <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23691934/picard-season-3-finale-review">a bunch of different things that don’t work together</a>, but they are all different shows. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-trek">Star Trek</a> was one thing, and beginning with <em>Discovery</em>, it became many things. And for Star Trek, an institution that preaches the value of infinite diversity in infinite combinations, that’s a legacy to be proud of. </p>
<p id="4CSt25"><small><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></small><small> is now streaming in full on Paramount Plus. </small></p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1797586744088621138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the Baldur’s Gate 3 team announced that the anticipated Patch 7 update will arrive sometime in September 2024, adding official modding tools.</p>



<p>The post adds that a closed alpha begins today, and that a closed beta is coming in July. The Beta will be capped at about 1,000 players. Larian previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-introduce-first-official-modding-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in April</a> that Patch 7 will introduce the first official modding tools. </p>



<p>During a community update, the devs explained that players will get to “change up visuals, animations, sounds, stats, and more.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Coming to you this September, Patch 7 will introduce an official modding toolkit so you can bring your wildest ideas to life!</p><p>💬Closed Alpha Begins Today<br>🗓️Closed Beta – July<br>🛠️Modding FAQ</p><p>Read more in Community Update #27 – Official Modding Support: <a href="https://t.co/lwdOkUUUOa">https://t.co/lwdOkUUUOa</a> <a href="https://t.co/EOwNFqh3gt">pic.twitter.com/EOwNFqh3gt</a></p></div>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1797586744088621138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>In community update 27 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, the devs elaborated on further details. The devs reiterated plans for fixes, Crossplay, and an in-game Photo Mode. However, they also teased some “anniversary extravagance.” </p>



<p>For Patch 7, the devs confirmed that PC players will be the first to use and install mods. Then, they will be available for “Mac players, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles” later on. Today’s post does not confirm exact release dates.</p>



<p>However, fans playing Baldur’s Gate 3 on console will only get to browse existing mods, rather than modding their own.  The devs confirmed that “the official modding tools themselves will not be available to those playing on console.”</p>



<p>Today’s post also mentions that the toolkit will include “a subset of our internal development tools.” This will allow players to edit mods, upload to mod.io servers, get access to supported asset types, and more.</p>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios also recently announced it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-opening-new-studio-in-warsaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening a seventh studio</a> located in Warsaw. The announcement comes as Larian looks ahead to two ambitious new RPGs.</p>

But on the downside, this is a world in which magic is a bit embarrassing.</p><p>Still, you’ve got something special. You alone have the ability to use Leximancy, a hitherto unimaginable power driven by something as fascinating as it is enchanting: language.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Leximancy is an endlessly fun branch of magic, but it is also a risk of buttock-clenching magnitude. Years ago you caused THINGS to happen, and ever since then you’ve been banished to the school basement with the other failures- I mean learners.</p><p>Your life as a humble basement-wizard is interrupted as Academy Elementinia is attacked by someone with a baffling agenda and a huge set of fireballs.</p><p>Don your trusty hat, ready your lexicon, become the outcast that saves the school.

Summon. Soothe. Enlarge. Enrage. Explode. Have a little sleep. Succeed strangely, or sit back and enjoy your failures. There are hundreds of different ways to play this game, and the best way is your way.</li><li><strong>Go Explore</strong> – It’s an absolute situation out there. The magical wilds are delirious with magic, the people of the cities hate wizards like you, and there are prisons.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Features Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>After Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online in 2023, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">confirmed it had multiple single-player games in development.</a> These games remain unannounced, but Druckmann has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">strongly suggested one will be The Last of Us: Part III.</a></p><p>"I've been thinking--is there a concept there [for The Last of Us 3]? For, now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently that's changed," he said in comments published in 2024. "I don't have a story. But I do have that concept that is, to me, as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2. As its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p>Beyond another entry in The Last of Us series, could Naughty Dog return to the Uncharted series? Don't get your hopes up for that, as Naughty Dog has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-is-done-with-uncharted-and-might-not-make-last-of-us-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6510879/" data-ref-id="1100-6510879">"done" with the franchise </a>(though a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">different team could, of course, make Uncharted 5</a>).</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-confirms-hes-writing-and-directing-a-new-game/1100-6516818/" data-ref-id="1100-6516818">writing and directing a new game</a>, but he can't say what it is just yet. "I know the fans really want The Last of Us: Part III, I hear about it all the time," Druckmann said in 2023. "All I can say is that we're already into our next project, the decision has already been made. I can't say what it is."</p><p>Some also believe that Naughty Dog might turn its attention to a totally new genre, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-the-last-of-us-part-1-is-teasing-naughty-dogs-next-ip/1100-6507123/" data-ref-id="1100-6507123">fantasy</a>, for its next game, which could be a new IP.</p><p>Druckmann recently made headlines for calling out the editing of an interview he did with his own company. While Sony removed the interview from its website, <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Druckmann uploaded his raw, unedited answers</a>, in which he said he is currently working on a "dream" project. He said, "It's maybe the most excited I've been for a project yet."</p><p>Sony's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/state-of-play-may-2024-all-the-biggest-ps5-announcements-and-games/2900-5435/" data-ref-id="2900-5435">State of Play briefing</a> had no details on any future Naughty Dog games. Many are expecting Sony to conduct its next PlayStation Showcase later this year, and if that happens, it could be a venue for Naughty Dog to announce a new project, but this is just speculation.</p>

        <p>Exec will discuss the potential for expanding IP across all forms of entertainment with games investor Jon Goldman</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The organisers of Gamescom Latam have announced David Alpert, CEO of Skybound Entertainment, as its inaugural keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Alpert — who is also known as the executive producer behind The Walking Dead and Invincible — will take part in a fireside chat with video games investor Jon Goldman on June 28, midway through the first ever Gamescom Latam.</p>
<p>During their session, entitled 'Expansion of IP and games', the pair will discuss the state of the games industry, as well as the opportunities for video games IP in other forms of entertainment (and vice versa).</p>
<p>"Being the keynote speaker at Gamescom Latam is an honor," said Alpert. "This inaugural event is a testament to the global reach of gaming culture, which never fails to bring together diverse communities to foster the future of games.</p>
<p>"We've reached a critical time in the industry where expanding our intellectual properties across movies, TV, games, and immersive realities is about more than just entertainment; it's about creating interconnected universes that immerse audiences in storytelling like never before."</p>
<p>Gamescom Latam CEO Gustavo Steinberg added:  "David and Jon's involvement marks a pivotal moment for Gamescom Latam as we explore the intersection of storytelling and gaming.</p>
<p>"The expansion of intellectual properties across platforms is not merely a trend but a fundamental shift in how we engage with content. David's profound knowledge of this phenomenon will undoubtedly enrich our audience's understanding and inspire new avenues of creative exploration."</p>
<p>Announced earlier this year, Gamescom Latam is a brand new event that encompasses and builds on the foundations of the BIG Festival in Brazil.</p>
<p>It will run from June 26 to 30 in São Paulo, Brazil, and is the product of a partnership between Gamecom organiser Koelnmesse, German trade body Game, BIG Festival, and pop culture and events firm Omelete Company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamescom-latam-launching-in-2024-merging-with-big-festival">we spoke to the organisers</a> to find out more about their ambitions for the event.</p>
<section><p>GamesIndustry.biz is a media partner for Gamescom Latam and will be attending with the support of the organisers.</p></section>
