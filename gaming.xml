Thomasina Bateman, a Victorian antiquary (basically an archaeologist) arrives by locomotive to the isolated village of Bewlay in the moors, large open areas dominated by hills. She is here to excavate the titular barrow but soon encounters a series of events in the small village that discourage her endeavors. </p><figure id="" data-id="a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-recommend-id="image://a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1275" data-height="715" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wadjet Eye Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-recommend-id="image://a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1275" data-height="715" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Taking the form of a classic pixel adventure game (think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-to-monkey-island-lucasarts-anniversary-1851653030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-monkey-island-lucasarts-anniversary-1851653030"><em>Monkey Island</em></a></span> series but less comedic), you step into the shoes of Thomasina on her journey in Bewlay. While the main goal is to dig at the barrow, the town’s web of residents and happenings sucks you in. Whether you are digging out on the moors, relaxing at the local tavern, or exploring the small town at night, the one constant is an overwhelming sense of smallness and dread in the isolated village.</p><p>Much like being on a ship at night and not seeing anything around for miles, the moors Thomasina finds herself in make Bewlay feel like the last bastion of humanity in any direction. The moors themselves are particularly threatening in their sprawling emptiness, which has led to folktales about them spreading amongst the villagers. Whether these are true or not, and whether they are impacting your sanity, is something to be discovered as you push on through the journey.</p><p>The most popular horror video games often revolve around jumpscares and monstrous enemies. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>Resident Evil</em></a></span> works because the zombies are scary as hell and it takes a while to gain back some power through finding new weaponry. The titular monster of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a></span> hunts you down and stabs you through the chest with its spear-like tail in a display that is likely to make you scream no matter how many times it happens. But none of that exists in <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>. Instead, there is an ever-prescient sense that you do not belong on the moors and that you cannot fathom the horrible things that lurk within them. The atmosphere of the game unnerves you at every turn but makes going down the rabbit hole enticing thanks to a well-written central mystery. For anybody looking for something more unique to play for Halloween, this is the game for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In contrast, the spirit entity known as Hyoki, exists solely to eliminate every Slitterhead. As the fight unfolds, secrets about this world will be revealed, intertwining the fates of both humans and creatures in a narrative that gradually unveils the complexities of humanity itself. </p><p>Slitterheads are mysterious creatures lurking in Kowlong, posing a threat to civilization. After consuming a human brain, they mimic the head and animate the corpse to disguise themselves as humans.</p><p>When preying on humans, they take on a “Pupal Form,” with the human head replaced by a grotesque visage, extending tentacles to target their prey’s brain. Slitterheads acquire memory and genetic information from the human brain, allowing them to imitate personalities. Each Slitterhead’s behavior varies, ranging from aimlessly wandering the streets to manipulating humans at the core of large organizations.</p><p><em>—Pupal Form</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_055.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_056.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_057.jpg"></a></figure><p>When the human body they inhabit suffers damage, they switch to a new victim’s body. However, they cannot operate independently or for long periods away from a host.</p><p>When they sense danger, they absorb the host’s bodily fluids to grow into a “Complete Form,” exposing their true nature and significantly increasing their power. They have integrated genes from various mimetic organisms, including insects, fish, and mollusks, resulting in a diverse range of appearances. While they primarily adopt a mantis-like posture, they can alter their form based on the situation, standing upright on two legs or climbing through gaps like a spider.</p><p><em>—Common Octopus Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_058.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_059.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Warty Frogfish Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_060.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_061.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Orchid Mantis Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_062.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_063.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Himomushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_064.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_065.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Dokumushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_066.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_067.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Tamamushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_068.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_069.jpg"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/novembers-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-deathwire-tokyo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony is keeping the spooky season going with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for November 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, an anime spin-off and some toy car racing – this last one’s not horror…</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus November 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 5th November.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/"><strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/"><strong>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged</strong></a> (PS5|PS4)</li>
<li><strong>Death Note Killer Within</strong> (PS5|PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is in intriguing spooky time in Tokyo, with plenty of Japanese mythology fed into a first person action game.&nbsp;We scored in the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">8/10 in our review</a>, with Nick saying “Ghostwire: Tokyo was not the game I was expecting from Tango Gameworks, but I definitely enjoyed it. Blending magic-filled FPS action with Japanese mythology and an open world Tokyo that reminds me of the Yakuza series, it stands out from the crowd even if it’s not truly groundbreaking. Ghostwire has a lot of potential as a new franchise and I’m looking forward to seeing what Tango Gameworks does with it next.”</p>

<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo was one of the last Bethesda games signed to PlayStation exclusivity before Microsoft snapped up the publisher. Not only that, but it’s ended up being the penultimate game from Tango Gameworks before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/xbox-exec-tells-staff-they-want-more-smaller-games-just-like-hi-fi-rush-one-day-after-closing-its-studio/">Microsoft decided to close the company</a> – though it’s now been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">saved by Krafton</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside that is the high-octane arcade racing of Hot Wheels Unleashed 2, a souped up sequel that delighted Ade in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/">our review</a>. he said, “Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged is like Hot Wheels Unleashed, but better in every single conceivable way. Frenetically fluid and stonkingly fast, this is a quality arcade racer that will slap smiles on the faces of both young and old alike. Just don’t mention the single-player campaign.”</p>

<p>And the month is rounded out by Death Note Killer Within, a social deduction game based on the popular murder book anime series. With up to 10 players, you’ll be split into two teams with different objectives, either to eliminate L or seize the Death Note, while also trying to figure out everyone’s identities from varying roles and characteristics. That certainly sounds a lot like the high stakes intrigue of the source material!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the October 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab October’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 5th November October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

<p>The 2025 season for Valorant Challengers is just around the corner, and in a recent press release, Riot Games unveiled some new changes and updates to the format and schedule for the APAC region. Here is everything we know as of now. </p>



<h2 id="h-academy-teams-to-join-valorant-challengers-in-2025">Academy Teams to Join Valorant Challengers in 2025</h2>



<p>In its official press release, Riot Games expressed the desire to “deepen its development pipeline” and will implement Academy Teams into the Challengers Leagues across the APAC region (Asia-Pacific).</p>



<p>The goal is for this change to allow teams to scout for new talent beforehand, allowing them to test and develop their rosters. However, Riot Games made it exceptionally clear that they still want to give opportunities to new teams trying to join the VCT Pacific. </p>



<p>Academy Teams will be able to participate in Challengers, but they will not be able to qualify for Ascension Pacific.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-participating-teams">Participating Teams</h2>



<p>The following teams have opted to have Academy Teams in their regional leagues:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Challengers Korea – DRX, Gen.G, T1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Japan – Zeta Division, DFM</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Southeast Asia – RRQ, Talon, Team Secret</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers South Asia – Global Esports</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The partnered teams who opt-in will be given a direct slot in their Challengers League for 2025.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-releases-2025-apac-schedule">Riot Releases 2025 APAC Schedule</h2>



<p>Riot Games has also revealed the 2025 APAC Calendar which includes three splits that will lead into Ascension.</p>



<p>Academy Teams will have the chance to play alongside their respective teams during these tournaments but will not be able to participate in Ascension.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More information about the upcoming 2025 schedule will be unveiled later on as we round the corner of the year. Will you be watching the 2025 VCT season?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-wont-pay-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-for-them-but-they-won%E2%80%99t-pay-you.1023318/</guid>

<p>The developers behind the failed extraction shooter The Day Before are asking people to design levels for its next game. Fntastic took to its Discord server (h/t <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-studio-now-asking-community-to-design-maps-for-free-in-newly-launched-contest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) to announce a “contest” for people to design a map for its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastics-latest-game-attempt-fails-so-they-announce-another-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest attempt at a game</a>, ITEMS.</p>



<p>The catch is, the winner of the contest won’t be paid for their work.</p>



<p>“This contest is a chance for you to unleash your creativity by designing a map that, if it wins, will be added to the game in future updates,” the announcement read.</p>



<p>Rules for participating in the “contest” were then laid out, which includes stating that submissions can be 2D drawings, 3D models, or “any other style”. In addition to the map design, submissions need to also include images and artwork, a full description, the map’s theme, layoff, and “balance considerations”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The kicker, as mentioned earlier, is that the person who creates the winning submission won’t receive any payment for the time put into designing the map. Instead, they’ll simply get a copy of the game — if it ever releases –, the map built for use in the game, and their name displayed “somewhere” on the map.</p>



<p>As of publishing, six maps have been submitted.</p>



<h2 id="h-fntastic-s-history-with-fan-submissions">Fntastic’s History With Fan Submissions</h2>



<p>Fntastic looking for fan submissions for its map designs isn’t something new for the studio. During the development of The Day Before, the studio regularly used unpaid volunteers for the development of its game. Those volunteers were located in various countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Finland, and more.</p>



<p>At one point, the studio claimed to be using over 100 full time volunteers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic holding a contest for maps for its new game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forum.</p>

While nothing has been confirmed by Activision, players now believe the rumored map can be seen while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a large-scale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">map that leaked with some controversy</a>, as the design includes islands separated with lots of water, giving Caldera 2.0 vibes. Now, players are discovering that using Black Ops 6's spectator mode lets them see a rendered version of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are loading into private matches on Black Ops 6's Lowtown map and using the game's Codcaster setting, which lets them fly out of bounds and explore areas beyond the playable map. This reveals that Lowtown is part of a much larger Warzone-style map. Pieces of this map include older multiplayer maps from previous Black Ops games, such as Firing Range, WMD, and Hacienda. It also includes a view of the cluster of islands as revealed from the previous leaks of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" rel="nofollow ">reported by CharlieIntel</a>, a fan has even gone to the lengths to create a speculative overhead map with named points-of-interest.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The upcoming Warzone map, which is rumored for Fall 2025, can be seen in Black Ops 6's Theater Mode if you go into spectating. <br>Fans have speculated the different POIs based on the locations. <br>Image: u/Dull-Caterpillar3153 <a href="https://t.co/Vfu4YwPv8A" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Vfu4YwPv8A</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While it is very likely that this is the rumored Avalon map for Warzone, it's uncertain when or if this map will arrive in the game.

                <p>Google is celebrating Halloween with a brand new installment of Magic Cat Academy--marking the third edition of the Doodle. In the past, Momo the cat has taken on <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2016/" rel="nofollow "><u>ghouls in school</u></a> and taken a <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2020/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deep dive</a> to tackle sea monsters. This year, Google pits Momo against ghosts and space creatures as she battles her arch nemesis, Marshmallow the ghost, across the cosmos.</p><p>The rules of the game are simple: Draw the designated lines to defeat ghosts and other monsters across five stages. The lines and their sequence get more difficult as the game progresses, but you can always draw a heart to get more life, you just have to be quick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427" data-ratio="0.56288659793814" data-width="1455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png"></figure><p>After every level, there's a small scientific fact about the level of the atmosphere and something that the level focused on like stars or the flying fox bat. Google even included a gallery of concept art ranging from level design to dropped ideas like Momo and Marshmallow becoming a giant mech and teaming up. There's also a photo of the real-life Momo lounging around.</p><p>The game will run through October 31, 11:59 PM ET. You can also learn more about this Doodle, Momo's other adventures, and past Doodles <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced its PlayStation Plus monthly lineup for November, and it includes a day one release for an all-new Death Note game.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/30/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-ghostwire-tokyo-death-note-killer-within/?sf275244630=1">PlayStation</a>, PS Plus subscribers on the Premium, Extra, and Essential tiers will be able to get their hands on the following three games from 5th November:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</li>
<li>Ghostwire: Tokyo</li>
<li>Death Note Killer Within</li>
</ul>

<p>The standout here is surely Death Note Killer Within, which Bandai Namco only announced today. It is described as the "first-ever social deduction game based on the legendary anime series".</p>
<p>The online game has cross-play support, and will see up to 10 players face a choice between life and death.</p>
<p>"Split into two teams, players must uncover each other’s identities to eliminate L or seize the Death Note from Kira," reads the official blurb. "Kira and L are equally matched, each hiding their true identity while battling for control over the game. Engage in a game of wits either as Kira and his follower, or L and the investigators, as both sides vie for the hidden Death Note, leading to a thrilling showdown of truth and deception until one team prevails."</p><p>Players can take on the role of either Kira, L, Kira Follower or Investigator on the game's release, with each role giving the chance to experience "unique gameplay characteristics". You can check out a trailer for Death Note Killer Within above.</p>
<p>In addition to PlayStation (where it can also be purchased separately), Death Note Killer Within will also be coming to PC via Steam on 5th November. We previously got wind of this new Death Note game earlier in the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-death-note-game-rated-in-taiwan-for-playstation-consoles">thanks to a rating in Taiwan</a>.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has started arriving in stores ahead of next week's launch, as confirmed by pictures making the rounds online.</p>
<p>One of the pictures, which can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pDdR1vP">here</a>, shows the front and back of the system's box, which provides information on the box's content and the system's basic features. Funnily enough, the 8K sticker that was found on the base model's launch box is nowhere to be seen, highlighting how that crazy high resolution is no longer considered a marketing point, even though the system is actually capable of running games at 8K resolution, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a>, unlike the base model.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you need to know more about the PlayStation 5 Pro box, Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20241029053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> posted a hilarious review of it, highlighting how the white hardware and text stand out against the seductive black color of the box and how it has a very PlayStation-like fragrance, and providing a comparison with boxes for previous generation consoles and the base PS5 models. Even with an automated translation, it is still a very entertaining read, so make sure to check it out if you need something to tide you over until the release of the system and the posting of proper reviews of the system.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, Vanguard: Normandy focuses on the struggle between the US and German armies as they battle to hold Normandy in the Summer of 1944. 1-4 players can take control of the American or German armies and partake in multiplayer campaign missions inspired by historical accounts. The game will also include a full solo-play mode following the real battles of the US Army.</p>

Players will capture objectives, navigate the fog of war, manage vital resources, gain different types of Requisition points, use them to deploy their forces.</p>

<p>No prior experience with Bolt Action is required. <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> is a standalone board game experience. In fact, Warlord Games designed this game to lower obstacles for those interested in the hobby of wargaming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone wants to assemble and paint miniatures before they play a game, so we're taking<br>
those obstacles away for Vanguard: Normandy whilst creating a board game that still feels like<br>
Bolt Action. By adapting the unit activation and pin mechanisms, the game will have a familiarity<br>
to Bolt Action players - the rest of the game, however, is brand new!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A copy of<em> Vanguard: Normandy</em> will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>More than 50 pre-assembled and pre-painted US and German miniatures, including armored vehicles</li>
	<li>15 Double-sided interlocking hex boards</li>
	<li>Fully detailed unit information cards</li>
	<li>Full color rules, campaign books, and punchboards</li>
	<li>A set of custom dice and wooden counters</li>
</ul><p>The crowdfunding campaign for <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> will go live on Kickstarter November 5. If you sign up to the game's mailing list before it goes live, you will receive an exclusive dice tray at no additional charge alongside the campaign's fulfillment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zero-orders-tactics-is-a-clever-turn-based-god-sim-with-a-touch-of-from-dust.1023264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zero-orders-tactics-is-a-clever-turn-based-god-sim-with-a-touch-of-from-dust<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Classic god sims like Populous and Black &amp; White teach that deities love to reach their horrible holy hands into our world and mess with us directly. They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be <em>inelegant</em>. It's far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Developed by Pauloondra - whose weighty works include the well-received arcade physics smasher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1018130/Castle_Break/">Castle Break</a> - Zero Orders Tactics is a hexagonal turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game in which friendly units always move from left to right, enemies always more from right to left, and your job is to alter the terrain in between so that the forces of light prevail. In other words, it's an autobattler where you fox the geography to suit the quirks and foibles of your battlers.</p>
<p>For example, a perfidious goblin is menacing a princess as she walks along a road to a castle. One way you could intervene is to conjure up some cavalry, but ah, even given the "goodies go first" rule, they won't reach your ambling damsel in time. However! That goblin is very partial to flat green countryside. If you swap a nearby mountain for some meadows, you can lull the pesky varmint into walking in the opposite direction. 
</p>
<p>
Now, imagine there are several of these units on the board, each with specific preferences about what they walk on, and different criteria for performing an attack. Where will you bestow your forests, your swamps, your hilltops so as to pluck the needle of victory from this haystack of competing pathfinding?
</p><p>
I've just given the demo a quick shake and it seems quite promising. The visuals and sound aren't anything to write home about - certainly, nothing like as marvelous as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-from-dust">From Dust</a>, which also favours tactical terraforming over moving units around - but the mechanics are swiftly engrossing. I think part of it is that once you've done the brainwork, you get to sit back magisterially and watch the pieces fall as predicted, which feels very divine. Yes, god has a plan for you <em>too</em>, rando minotaur in the woods.</p>
<p>The full game has a roguelite campaign with the chance to build up a deck of terrain types and units. It's out on 4th November, and you can find the Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1877650/Zero_Orders_Tactics/">here</a>.

The art style looks like a mashup of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> miniatures, and the gameplay revolves around rows of characters battling it out with turn-based abilities in search of XP and loot. Players grow their champions or craft new ones and can then sell them on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto-backed marketplace</a></span>. </p><p>Here’s the gameplay trailer:</p><p>While the most expensive champion currently listed has an asking price of $63K, or about 1.9 million gold, many of the most recently listed ones are going for anywhere from $5 to around $200. The way cryptocurrency game economies tend to work is that players invest money to get stronger teams to win more matches to make their collectibles more valuable in the hopes of then turning around and selling them to newer recruits.

The French publisher has been keeping at it, though, in case the gaming genre ever does blow up into something bigger. </p><p>Weirdly, <em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles </em>lists an age rating of “adults only” in one of its trailers. A spokesperson for the ESRB told <em>IGN</em> that this was an error, and the game hasn’t officially been rated at all yet. It’s still unclear how successful the game will be, or if that will even matter for Ubisoft’s ongoing blockchain ambitions. The fact that <em>Champions Tactics</em> revolves around an NFT economy isn’t even the worst thing it has going for it. That would instead be the fact that you can currently only play it by downloading the company’s Ubisoft Connect launcher, which to some is even more disqualifying than needing to connect a crypto wallet. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Although Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones doesn't seem to have any pets during his globetrotting years, the third film--Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade--established that Indy once had a dog named Indiana that he loved very much. And Indy's love for dogs is one reason why he won't be shooting any enemy canines in Bethesda and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-much-nicer-to-its-dogs-than-wolfenstein" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, MachineGames Creative Director Jens Andersson confirmed that Indy's encounters with dogs owned by the bad guys won't end the same way they did in the developers' Wolfenstein games. Instead, Indy can scare off the dogs by pointing his weapon at them, rather than actually following through on the threat.</p><p>"[Indiana Jones] is a dog person," said Andersson. "This is obviously a little bit different than Wolfenstein as well, where the dog will explode... It's a family-friendly IP in many ways. How do we do that well? Well, these are the kind of things that we do. We have dogs as enemies, but you don't really hurt the dogs. You scare them away."</p><p>That's fortunate for the canines, but less so for Doctor Jones. As noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431"> early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the game favors stealth over all-out action. The enemy dogs may prove to be another challenge for Indy to remain undetected by Nazi soldiers. He may not shoot the dogs, but Indiana Jones has never had a problem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">punching a Nazi in the face</a>. As part of this game, Indy can also take out Nazis with stealth attacks and improvised weapons.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9.

            <p>An unannounced Warzone map has seemingly leaked, and is explorable in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>

<p>Avalon is rumoured to be the Warzone map for 2025, and reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dull-Caterpillar3153/">Dull-Caterpillar3153</a> has laid out the various locations within the map itself (below).</p>
<p>"As you can see there's a lot of classic Black Ops maps that will appear on this map including Firing Range, Hacienda and WMD," the poster wrote. </p>
<p>Eurogamer asked Activision for further comment on this leak, however the company declined.</p>

			<p>In a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">developer diary</a> for Titan Quest II, those who are excited about the game get to find out more about the Skills and Modifiers that will be available in the game. Players will be given a chance to combine any two masteries to create their own class to help them stand out from the ground and provide them with a unique class. When Early Access begins (which is slated for <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">Winter 2024</a>), players will have access to Earth, Storm, and Warfare masteries. As the game begins to be updated during the Early Access period, there will be more masteries available, providing new and returning players with the opportunity to mix up their class type further and create something new.</p>
<p>In the new Titan Quest II dev diary, players are given a preview into some of the skills that will be available, alongside the modifiers that can drastically change the game for the player. While some of the Modifiers available are passive tweaks that work in the background, some of them are active, and can turn an attack from a sweeping strike into a whirlwind attack, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, players will be able to equip a maximum of 10 skills to the ability bar, allowing for a varied playstyle. This means that you can have a primary damage type and have your other skills be defensive and supportive skills that can provide synergies to your damaging skills. Of course, as previously mentioned, there will be skill trees for players to explore, which helps players decide between active or passive skills and modifiers, which can help bring your character from zero to hero.</p>
<p>In the dev diary that is posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/4445708897933590548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog</a>, there are videos that show examples of how the different masteries work and how the modifiers interact with the different masteries. For example, there is a video that shows off Earth Mastery and how you can use modifiers to create a Lava Fissure skill that produces a line AoE on the floor, dealing strike damage to your enemy, as well as dealing fire damage. Of course, since the skill has been modified, it will cost extra energy. There are also further tweaks you can make, such as the Additional Fissures modifier which reduces your overall damage, but allows you to spawn in extra fissures to cover more ground.</p>

<p>There are plans to showcase more gameplay footage in the future, when more dev diaries are released for Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>Will you be getting this game in the Early Access period? Let us know in the comments.</p>

It’s a hand-me-down from a bygone era, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031">like the AK-74</a></span>, but one that offers enough customization and versatility to make it viable on any battlefield. It also proves itself as one of the more capable weapons for new players to grasp in <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>With the right attachments, perks, and Wildcard, the XM4 dominates any game mode with ease, with a relatively low TTK (time to kill), manageable recoil, and, as mentioned, versatility in its available attachments to satisfy any play style.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite being the stock weapon the game provides you with upon launching into multiplayer, the XM4 offers endless possibilities. It’s highly customizable, potent, and accurate, making it the ideal starter assault rifle for new players. But most importantly, even long-time veteran players will find it a viable weapon in competitive scenes, too.</p><p>With the right attachments, the XM4 will help you dominate any game mode, but it excels in larger maps with spacious shooting lanes. After all, this is an assault rifle and not a submachine gun or shotgun, so while it can handle an enemy in close quarters with some luck, you’ll find it most effective at range.</p><p>To improve the viability of the XM4, opt for these attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: CHF Barrel</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li></ul><p>With the Gunfighter perk active, add the following attachments to your XM4 for a more well-rounded, potent weapon:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Accu-Spot Reflex</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Combat Stock</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you work on leveling up your XM4, you won’t have many valuable attachments immediately.

The Suppressor takes care of the latter, while the extended magazine and rear grip keep you quick on your toes and in the fight longer. Other than that, the goal is to reduce weapon sway and horizontal recoil as much as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For this XM4 build, we want to take the following Perks, Wildcard, and Equipment:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho (Increases Sprint and Tactical Sprint while reloading or utilizing Equipment)</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Dexterity (Reduces overall weapon sway while jumping, diving, or diving)</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time (Doubles the overall duration of Tactical Sprint)</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Enforcer (Killing enemies grants a temporary speed buff and increases health regen rate)</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li><li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>: Frag Grenade</li><li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>: Stim Shot</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Assault Pack</li></ul><p>As mentioned previously, opting for the Gunfighter Wildcard will allow you to utilize three additional weapon attachment slots.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you rank up in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, you’ll have plenty of time to learn the ins and outs of the XM4.

The device’s WiFi is already crap, so downloads pausing in sleep mode was especially annoying. Imagine <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out at midnight. You initiate the installation and go to sleep and eight hours later it’s somehow <em>still</em> downloading?</p><p>The other bug fix in the update likely impacted many fewer players, but will be a godsend all the same for <em>Smash Bros.</em> fans. The console was having a tough time recently recognizing GameCube controllers attached using adapters, a common enough thing for fans of the platform fighter raised on its <em>Melee</em> incarnation. It sounds like those connection issues are resolved now as well.</p><p>Now all the Switch needs is a sleep mode that uses way less battery when there aren’t things downloading. The only thing worse than waiting for a game to install is coming back to your Switch and seeing the battery life in the single digits. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">Hopefully the Switch 2</a></span> is able to tap into whatever dark magic was powering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-vitas-sleep-mode-is-pure-sorcery-1830753209?_gl=1*1874cou*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDI5MzY3Mi41MS4xLjE3MzAzMDAzNDMuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-vitas-sleep-mode-is-pure-sorcery-1830753209?_gl=1*1874cou*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDI5MzY3Mi41MS4xLjE3MzAzMDAzNDMuNjAuMC4w">PlayStation Vita’s power-saving mode</a></span>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2-not-in-eas-plans-company-to-continue-innovating-current-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are hoping for EA to release Apex Legends 2, you might want to let go of that hope for now. </p>



<p>During its latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about what the company’s plans were involving Apex Legends in order to regain a player base that has been steadily declining. One of those questions involved the possibility of doing a full rebuild of the game, and launching an Apex 2.0, of sorts.”</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson said. </p>



<p>“And so actually, the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have and deliver the new innovative creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they’ve made or the investment that they have put into the existing ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Wilson then went on to say that EA’s goal is to “innovate in the core experience” of Apex Legends. He said that it’s been seen as seasons move forward and continue to grow. </p>



<p>“[W]e’re changing kind of key modalities at play within those seasons and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers,” he said. “And we think we can do those two things together, and we don’t believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.”</p>



<p>Wilson also said that he, and the company, believe that Apex Legends is in an “incredibly good position” moving forward. Specifically, he mentioned the ability of the game to reach the “very top tier” of the genre while having a “strong brand”, “strong mechanic”, and a “very committed global community”.</p>



<p>Despite no plans for a completely new Apex Legends game, Wilson admitted that there is a need for changes to the game in order to keep that community happy and engaged with the game for months and years to come.</p>



<p>“We’ve also observed is a need for kind of meaningful systematic innovation in the game that fundamentally changes the way the game plays more broadly and our teams are working on that as well,” he said.</p>



<p>As far as what those innovations could be, that wasn’t mentioned. It was only reiterated that the “team is working through” it.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Eight years after its 2016 launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has finally completed 100% of the game he created.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Barone--who single-handedly crafted every inch of Stardew Valley, from its art to its soundtrack to its code--has completed full start-to-finish playthroughs of his game in the past. But this week, Barone revealed that he's recently completed the game in its entirety by unlocking all of Stardew Valley's 49 Steam achievements--and that the game's 1.6 update now has a concrete release date for console and mobile devices.</p><p>"I had to do it over a couple days because I was on a multiplayer farm," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851128915047387239" rel="nofollow ">told a curious fan</a> on Twitter. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run."</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, player-characters can't just keel over and literally die in Barone's cozy little farming sim (although they can pass out). But Stardew Valley includes several arcade-style mini-games in which the <em>player-character's</em> player-character can, in fact, die. This doesn't have particularly dire consequences… unless you're shooting for the Fector's Challenge achievement. Unlocking this achievement requires players to beat one of the aforementioned arcade mini-games--Journey of the Prairie King, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/smash-tv/">Smash TV</a>-style game found in the Stardrop Saloon--without dying. Journey of the Prairie King consists of <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Journey_of_the_Prairie_King#Levels" rel="nofollow ">three stages, with a total of 10 areas to navigate</a> (plus a boss fight at the end of each stage). The minigame is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/413150/discussions/0/3288067088131225168/">notoriously difficult</a>, and is often the last achievement that Stardew Valley completionists manage to finish.</p><p dir="ltr">"I deliberately worked on Fector's Challenge because it was the only one I didn't have," <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851125512753774643" rel="nofollow ">Barone said</a>, confirming that just like many other Stardew Valley achievement hunters, Fector's Challenge was the final hurdle he had to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev also shared some tips for players who are struggling to master Journey of the Prairie King.</p><p dir="ltr">"You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851149876517912827" rel="nofollow ">explained after a player asked for advice</a>. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun power-up for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack you."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone also shared some helpful info on fighting the Outlaw:</p><p dir="ltr">"He has two moves, one where he moves across the screen and shoots," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851365802521608222" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a>. "For that one, move in the opposite direction as him to avoid his bullets, and then hit him diagonally when he pauses. The other move, he pops out and shoots straight at you. If you position yourself right at the edge of his 'cover,' he won't be able to hit you, but you can hit him."</p><p dir="ltr">But perhaps the most interesting info Barone revealed during his chat with players regarding the achievement had nothing to do with minigames at all. Instead, Barone confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update</a> is hitting consoles very soon.</p><p dir="ltr">How soon, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">"1 week," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851126588253045196" rel="nofollow ">tweeted in reply to a player</a> who had asked if there was any news about the console update.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1.6 update launched for PC last March, and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/">a massive amount of content</a>, including new items and crafting materials, improved NPC dialogue, new pets for players to adopt, a quest about a really big tree, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389"></a><figcaption>The 1.6 update breathes new life into Stardew Valley's numerous NPCs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the initial PC launch introduced a few bugs, and the update itself wasn't yet ready for release on console or mobile. Barone pledged that he would temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">cease all work on Haunted Chocolatier</a> until the Stardew Valley 1.6 update was "settled."</p><p dir="ltr">"I am eager to get back to work on [Haunted Chocolatier]," he said at the time. "But I have to see Stardew 1.6 settled, bug-free and out to all platforms first."</p><p dir="ltr">In September, he provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">an update on the state of Stardew 1.6</a>, acknowledging that the console and mobile ports were taking some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was originally hoping [the PC update and console/mobile updates] would be [releasing] maybe one month apart, max," Barone admitted. "At any rate, I feel bad about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Later that month, Barone quietly made <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow ">a post on the official Stardew Valley website</a> revealing that the update would come to console and mobile devices on November 4, which tracks with Barone's recent statement that the update is just a week away.</p><p dir="ltr">"The console and mobile ports of the 1.6 update will be released on November 4th, 2024," Barone's post reads. "Thank you for your patience. The console and mobile ports will release at version 1.6.9, which will also come to PC around that time."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone's wording makes it sound like 1.6.9 might not release for PC at the exact same time it lands on console and mobile devices. So it's unclear if he means the 1.6.9 update will come to PC a few hours after it hits console and mobile, or if PC players will have to wait a few days or weeks to gain access. Regardless, this is good news for both die-hard Stardew Valley fans and players who are itching to get their hands on Barone's next creation. </p><p>"I'm looking forward to having 1.6 fully released on all platforms," Barone said after announcing the release date. "Then I would like to finish Haunted Chocolatier next. Thank you."</p>

Torvenius said the game should "feel cohesive" and that means "running smoothly at 60[fps] on both [Xbox Series X and S]."</p>

<p>Torvenius added, "You know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product." He added that MachineGames may release more details on the game's technical specifics ahead of launch "once we see all the telemetry on performance."</p><p>As usual, developers may not know the final details on technical performance until closer to launch, as optimization efforts continue up to release.</p><p>Torvenius shared this information against the backdrop of ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox. </a></p><p>Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a></p><p>The Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling.

			<p>The Halloween season has come back around, and players will be able to experience the Tower Raid once more, but with a Halloween twist. In Dying Light 2, players will be able to experience the Tower Raid: Halloween Run event, where there are new levels, weapons, rewards, and a very festive final boss fight for those who manage to climb to the top. For those who want to take part in the event, the Dying Light 2 Tower Raid: Halloween Run will last from October 30 to November 20. This event is available for players right after the prologue, meaning those who are new to the game will be able to get stuck in without having to sit through a ton of missions first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light 2: Stay Human — Tower Raid: Halloween Run" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC56Q9bG_yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The event offers plenty of new rewards, new candies, and the return of Baka, who will be waiting at the Bazaar, offering bounties for you to complete. To celebrate the release of Tower Raid: Halloween Run in Dying Light 2, a trailer has been released. This event will also feature new content for each week that it's available.</p>
<p>For the first week of the event in Dying Light 2, players will be able to get to grips with the new progression system that has been designed specifically for this event, as well as getting their hands on some of the rewards up for grabs. By the second week, players will be able to increase the difficulty level as Elite Mode makes a return to the event, as well as exclusive bounties to participate in. For the third week, you'll be able to unlock daily bounties, which will help contribute to getting your hands on rewards.</p>
<p>As this is a separate event version of Tower Raid, there will be eight floors in total to work through, with a themed boss at the top. Some of the floors are entirely new to the game, with all of them being decorated to fit in with the Halloween theme. To celebrate the festive season, there is also a brand new character system where players will be able to select a role from four options that are available. They each have unique loadouts and traits. The characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarecrow - Two-handed scythe wielder and increased HP pool</li>
<li>Plague - Increased melee damage and stamina with a Plague Cane that utilizes the buffs</li>
<li>Van Aiden - Crossbow and increased ranged damage</li>
<li>Cursed Pirate - Cutlass-wielder with parkour damage perks</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Halloween update, there is a new patch released for Dying Light 2, which adds a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life improvements, as well as new weapons for players to obtain. There will also be a new firearm control layout, which can be activated in the control system. It's been confirmed that there will be future updates to work on making this game a smoother, enhanced experience for the players.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who prefer to find out the patch notes and major updates added to a game via a video format, the development team has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA1Uq6aWyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying 2 Know More</a>, which talks about the Halloween event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/">future plans for the game</a>.</p>
