            <p>
Who's that I hear coming down my chimney? Why, it's… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megabonk">Megabonk's</a> "Spooky" update? No, that doesn't sound quite right to me either, and yet it is in fact the truth of this world. As you've probably already gathered by the name of the update, this is one that was meant to be out for Halloween, but developer Vedinad needed a touch more time for it.
</p>
<p>
As explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340/view/523110495538905880?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing all the new stuff, it was originally planned as just a tiny Halloween update, but they wanted to add in a few other bits and pieces, so the workload just ended up being bigger. Anyway, here's some of the bits you can expect from the update, which is admittedly scant in precise details.
</p>
<p>
There's a new map, character, weapon, as well as new items, enemies and bosses, achievements, and challenges. To get any more insight on any of this, you'll have to play the game for yourself, as the post literally says nothing else about new additions. Although, the game's Zwitter account <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/2000274122127897019">does note</a> that there's "canned spaghetti with extra sauce," if that means anything to anyone.
</p>
<p>
It's not just new things, however. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> clone should look a bit smoother late-game with some FPS improvements for one. A number of bugs have been fixed, including one where you could buy items you didn't have unlocked, and another annoying one where the game might reset when teleporting to the next stage to keep your progress, and in turn resulting in not moving to the next stage.
</p><p>
There's a bunch of balancing bits and new settings to be found as well, and an interesting addition for speedrunner, potentially. You can now open up the game's console, which as noted by the devs, is "only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something." Anyway, what's next, a Christmas update in July? Humbug!

            <guid>1383664</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">We got a lot of great games in 2025.</a> Some big, some small. But not every game released over the last 12 months was good. Some were meh. And others, well, others were downright terrible.</p> <p>As we’ve said before, the best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games. And 2025 had plenty of these to choose from.&nbsp;So let’s take a look at some of the worst-reviewed games of 2025.</p> <p>But before we do that, it’s worth repeating once again that liking a “bad” game isn’t a <em>bad</em> thing. Numbered scores come with all sorts of caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them at <em>Kotaku</em>. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, don’t get mad, just smugly nod to yourself and remind yourself that the critics got it wrong.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w">Now,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/worst-games-2024-metacritic-review-scores-funko-jjk-1851714921">as we’ve</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w">done in</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w">previous years</a>, here are the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/worst-videogames-of-2025/9/">10 worst-rated games on&nbsp;Metacritic</a> (they had to receive at least four reviews to qualify).</p> <h2>10: <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</em> | 45 Metascore</h2>  <p>Even priced at $30, this budget racer port of a so-so arcade game isn’t worth it. You are better off dropping a few quarters into the original arcade version and playing for a few minutes of nonsense before realizing it has little to offer and moving on.</p>

 <h2>9: <em>Glover</em> |&nbsp; 44 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Glover</em> is back. I’m so sorry. This port of the OG N64 platformer that someone liked, surely, isn’t much of an upgrade, and even if it was, this is still <em>Glover</em> we are talking about, folks. It’s lucky to make any list.</p>

 <h2>8: <em>Scar-Lead Salvation</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Wait a minute, this game has the same metascore as <em>Glover</em>, and yet it is worse? Yeah, I’m ranking it below <em>Glover</em> as it has more reviews, so more people didn’t like this pricey and basic anime spin on a <em>Returnal</em>-esque roguelike shooter.</p>

 <h2>7: <em>Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Oh, and look at that, one more game that landed at a 44 Metascore.<em> Ambulance Life</em> slides just below whatever the last game was because even more people played, reviewed it, and didn’t like its AI-generated dialogue, clunky gameplay, and ugly visuals.</p>

 <h2>6: <em>Tamagotchi Plaza – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> | 43 Metascore</h2>  <p>This sequel to <em>Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop</em> falls flat on its face because it plays more like a bad mobile game than TKTK and it has some truly repetitive minigames.</p>

 <h2>5: <em>Gore Doctor</em> | 40 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Gore Doctor i</em>s the first game on the list that I had never heard of before, and now that I do know about it, I’m happy to have avoided this horror game that is apparently a technical mess with terrible controls.</p> <h2>4: <em>Spy Drops</em> | 39 Metascore</h2>  <p>Someone wanted to make a stealth-action game like the OG <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. Sadly, this game is bogged down by a lot of problems, including a bad camera, bugs, and brain-dead enemy AI.</p> <h2>3:<em> Blood of Mehran</em> | 38 Metascore</h2>  <p>Critics really disliked this <em>Prince of Persia</em>-like action game, with nearly every review calling it some form of terrible. Avoid at all costs.</p> <h2>2: <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> | 37 Metascore</h2>  <p>What if <em>Among Us,</em> but <em>Fire Emblem</em>? That was seemingly the pitch for this mobile-only Nintendo-published dud. Even the few good ideas are overshadowed by free-to-play garbage and a lack of content. I’d probably just play <em>Among Us i</em>nstead.</p> <h2>1: <em>MindsEye</em> | 28 Metascore</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">lol, yeah that seems right.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-practically-gives-away-windows-11-pro-at-94-off-plus-a-kotaku-exclusive-code-that-pushes-the-price-even-lower-2000653043</link>
            <guid>1383658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been considering a PC upgrade, there’s no better moment than right now. Windows 11 Pro—Microsoft’s most up-to-date and feature-rich operating system—is currently being offered at an unusually steep discount. Instead of paying the typical $200 price tag, you can pick up a genuine license for just $10 through StackSocial. That amounts to roughly 94% off. It’s an appealing option whether you’re replacing an outdated OS or finalizing a new computer build, but it just got even more appealing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">We at Kotaku managed to score you an even better deal. If you use our exclusive discount code<strong> KOTAKU10</strong>, you’ll end up saving yourself an extra 10%.</a> Now, sure, that 10% works out to 99 cents. You might be thinking that pretty negligible, but that’s nonsense. Money saved is money saved. Get Windows 11 Pro for just $9.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Smarter Tools Designed to Boost Productivity</h2>
<p>One of the most helpful additions to Windows 11 Pro is Universal Search, conveniently placed right on the taskbar. This feature acts as a centralized search engine for your entire device and beyond. It simultaneously scans your applications, documents, photo library, and even the web. Doesn’t matter if you’re hunting for a PowerPoint file, trying to pull up a recipe you saved months ago, or quickly checking a location on a map, Universal Search streamlines the process. Instead of digging through folders or juggling browser tabs, you now have a one stop shop for anything you’d ever need to find in a single search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro of course is built from the ground up for OneDrive integration. With OneDrive, your files stay synchronized across all your devices without any extra effort. Saving a document on your desktop means you can retrieve it later on your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. This cloud-based workflow is especially valuable for remote workers, students, and anyone juggling multiple devices. While OneDrive itself requires a separate subscription, the reliability and accessibility it offers make it a beneficial companion to Windows 11 that’s definitely worth dipping into.</p>



<p>The operating system also shines with its improved Virtual Desktops feature. By enabling Task View, you can build multiple customized desktops tailored to different aspects of your life. You can have one desktop dedicated to work, another for entertainment and browsing, a third for launching all your games, and perhaps a separate one devoted to creative projects. Each virtual desktop can sport its own layout, wallpaper, and shortcuts, helping you maintain organized spaces that you can switch between them effortlessly.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about some of the several lesser-known keyboard shortcuts that can noticeably speed up your day-to-day tasks. A great example is the Win + V command, which opens your clipboard history. Unlike the standard Ctrl + V function, which pastes only your most recent copied item, Win + V lets you select from multiple previously copied clips. This is incredibly handy when filling out forms, gathering research, or moving text around without constantly swapping between tabs or apps.</p>
<p>StackSocial’s heavily discounted offer won’t last forever. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to upgrade your operating system, securing a Windows 11 Pro license for under $10 is an opportunity worth jumping on before it disappears. And remember to use the code <strong>KOTAKU10</strong> to save that extra $1, bringing it to $9.</p>

            <guid>1383655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, and welcome to your previously scheduled Monday. Don’t watch the clock, and this terrible day will end soon. Until then, enjoy this installment of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. This time around, we get an update on <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em>, check in on <em>Fallout Shelter</em>, and perhaps sing that famous Grinch Christmas song.</p> <h2><strong>Casey Hudson denies claims that <em>FOTOR</em> is five years away</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">During last week’s Game Awards, S<em>tar Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em> was revealed</a>, and people got excited. A spiritual successor to<em> Knights of the Old Republic</em> led by that game’s director, Casey Hudson, who also helped create <em>Mass Effect</em>? Heck yeah. But, as pointed out by a few different reporters, this new<em> Star Wars</em> game is being developed by a studio that’s just a few months old and so, folks speculated, the game was likely a long way off, possibly not launching until 2030.&nbsp; This speculation quickly snowballed into full-on “rumors” and spread like wildfire, without proper context online, eventually leading to Hudson <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">publicly denying the 2030 date on social media</a>.</p>

 <p>“Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">posted Hudson</a> on December 12. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p> <p>And while I’d love to be playing <em>FOTOR</em> sooner rather than later, I am curious as to why Hudson is so confident that something as large as a new <em>KOTOR</em>-like<em> Star Wars</em> RPG can be developed in under five years by a team that was just formed a few months ago. Maybe they have a super solid, streamlined plan with lots of support and resources to spare? Or maybe Hudson found a genie lamp? Regardless, according to Hudson, <em>FOTOR</em> will be out sometime before 2030. Place your bets now.</p>

 <h2><strong>10 years later, and <em>Fallout Shelter</em> just got its biggest update ever</strong></h2> <p>Mobile bunker-builder <em>Fallout Shelter</em> has been around since June 2015. And despite its age, <em>Shelter</em> is still extremely popular, receiving ports to console and PC and numerous updates. Its most recent one, out now, is its biggest yet, adding seasons, new characters, quests, and more connections to Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show.</p>

 <p>“Rejoice, Overseers – <em>Fallout Shelter</em>’s biggest update yet is here,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588430/Fallout_Shelter/">explained Bethesda on the game’s Steam page</a>. “Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.” It ain’t <em>Fallout 5,</em> but at least it’s something.</p>

 <h2><strong>Arcade1Up might have shut down over the weekend</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, as reported by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/reports-suggest-arcade1up-is-shutting-down"><em>Time Extension</em></a>, an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/1pjy92j/megathread_arcade1up_is_shutting_down/">email was shared online</a> that seemed to indicate that Arcade1Up, a company that specializes in creating modern arcade cabinets, was shutting down. The reported internal email, which was sent on December 10, claims that Arcade1Up shut down on December 12 and that the future of the brand is unknown. At least one dev studio that had worked with the arcade makers has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/17cia8r/comment/k5umj6g/">already indicated</a> that its classic ports will still support online play via a backdoor that players will be able to turn on in the future if the shutdown affects online servers. So far, Arcade1Up has yet to confirm or deny the reports of its demise.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Katamari Damacy’s</em> creator might be done making games after T<em>o a T</em> sold poorly</strong></h2> <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of <em>Katamari Damacy,</em> released a new and odd-looking game this year, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-indie-to-a-t-giraffe-song-sugar-1851766204">To a T</a>,&nbsp;</em>and if that’s the first you’re hearing about it, well, you aren’t alone. Apparently, the famed creator says the game didn’t sell well, and it has potentially forced him out of the game industry.</p>

 <p>“I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do so was because <em>T</em><em>o a T</em>&nbsp;didn’t sell well,” <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Takahashi recently told <em>GamesRadar</em>.</a> “My next goal is to support my children and find them a school in Japan. Then, if I feel that I don’t belong in the games industry, I’ll have to look elsewhere.”</p> <p>It’s a real shame that an offbeat game like <em>To a T,</em> struggled to find an audience in 2025, and when the developer was asked if there was still room for weird, experimental games in the industry, Takahashi said “I’m not sure” and admitted that it’s “definitely” become harder for him to make these kinds of games anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106">Here’s our review of <em>Pokémon’s</em> new DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">Learn more about<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">The makers of <em>Doom</em> have formed a union</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

                <p>Larian Studios made a splash at The Game Awards with its new--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">and really gross</a>--trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-reveals-its-biggest-game-ever-divinity/1100-6536878/" data-ref-id="1100-6536878">next Divinity game</a>. And if you're wondering what Divinity even is, Larian has now released the latest game in the series, Divinity: Original Sin II, on the newest modern platforms, with a free upgrade available.</p><p>The game launched today, December 15, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. People who own a copy of the game for Switch, PS4, or Xbox One can download the Upgrade Pack for free. The exception is Japan, where the upgrade costs a nominal fee of ¥100, or about 64 cents.</p><p>For anyone just buying the game now, it normally sells for $50, but on Xbox, Original Sin II is<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marked down to $17.50 right now</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmsdEAMY0aDufiuPCF6PPoTp05uXd5tWBfwuK2LOLtlT8PAdIi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 on Switch</a>, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3526-PPSA06865_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$15 on PlayStation.</a></p><p>The new version of Original Sin II is not a remake or a remaster, but instead it is, "Your way to experience the classic DOS:2 on the current generation of consoles," Larian said. The developer did not provide any further details on any possible improvements or updates on the new hardware.</p><p>Divinity: Original Sin II was originally released in 2016 as a sequel to 2014's Divinity: Original Sin. The turn-based tactical RPG was highly regarded, scoring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/divinity-original-sin-2-review/1900-6416769/" data-ref-id="1900-6416769">10/10 at GameSpot</a> and picking up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/divinity-original-sin-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other high marks from critics and fans.</a></p><p>As for the new Divinity game that was just recently announced, Larian said the new title will "offer a completely new story." However, the game also has "some continuity and characters" from past games.</p><p>The game made waves at The Game Awards in part for its intense CGI announcement trailer that featured people having sex in front of a pyre where a man was burned alive. The new Divinity was the game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/" data-ref-id="1100-6536822">Geoff Keighley's mysterious monolith had been teasing.</a> There is no release date yet for the new Divinity, but Larian has said it's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-reveals-its-biggest-game-ever-divinity/1100-6536878/" data-ref-id="1100-6536878">biggest game the studio has ever made.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/digital-foundrys-graphics-of-the-year-awards-nod-to-some-switch-2-beauties</link>
            <guid>1383619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>2026 is almost upon us, so naturally, everyone is thinking about end-of-year awards. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">hosted his ceremony last week</a>, and today, it's time for the tech experts from <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">Digital Foundry</a> to get involved, as they run down their best graphics of 2025.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that the shortlist this year is mainly comprised of titles found on PS5 and Xbox Series, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mafia_the_old_country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> getting their flowers, but a handful of Switch newbies got a nod too.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry dedicated the entirety of its honourable mentions section to the Switch 2 this year, giving a shoutout to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> for "maximising the Tegra T239 in different ways", and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which DF calls "currently Switch 2's best 'impossible port'." The outlet also highlights Panic Button's work on the Switch 1-to-2 upgrades.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Switch 2 is entirely absent from the official top 10, mind you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> lands a spot all of its own, with DF calling Samus' latest "a lighting masterwork - a prime (pun intended) example of how pre-baked lighting inside carefully crafted environments, whether fully indoors or exposed to outdoor elements, can implement attractive lighting phenomena like emissive lighting while also organically leading players."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 version</a> of MP4 even gets a shoutout in the Digital Foundry listing, with the outlet praising how it delivers "so much ecosystem diversity within large exploration zones at a steady 60fps, building upon the already impressive likes of Metroid Prime 1 Remastered to push the 2017 console to its limits."</p>
<p>As ever, Digital Foundry's top 10 is unordered until hitting the top three, with the seven preceding entries sorted alphabetically instead. Here's the full list, as laid out on the Digital Foundry website:</p>
<p><strong>- Dying Light: The Beast</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Earthion</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Ghost of Yōtei</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Mafia: The Old Country</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Routine</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Silent Hill f</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></p>
<p>A pretty good year for good-looking games, then! You'll find the team's explanation for each entry either in the video at the top of this article or by heading over to the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">DF site</a>.</p>

		<p>Embark has revealed what’s coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another. There’s a new Cold Snap map condition to endure, and Flickering Flames to warm you up when you get back to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flickering Flames Winter Event | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdGMteCqknE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cold Snap is a new map condition from 16th December, as brutal cold and blizzard can roll in and force you to approach scavengine missions in a different way.</p>
<p>Embark say, “The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.”</p>
<p>And with the difficulties above, Speranza is also having to endure food scarcity and rolling blackouts by gathering in candle light and sharing what little they have. Flickering Flames is the name for this event, which runs from 16th December through 13th January.</p>

<p>You’ve got two new major goals when heading above the surface, looking to gather the Candleberry Bush which sustains the city through the winter, and also light and heat sources to boost morale.</p>
<p>Candleberries and light and heat special items will be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li value="1">Raider Tokens</li>
<li value="2">New items</li>
<li value="3">Rare utility items</li>
<li value="4">Weapons</li>
<li value="5">Cosmetics</li>
<li value="6">Merits</li>
</ul>

<p>And then, as a Christmas treat, the second free and permanent Raider Deck is coming to the game on 26th December. This is a string of items to unlock, Raider Tokens and cosmetics,, building up to the hockey-inspired outfit and hockey stick “tool” of The Goalie.</p>

			<p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming a key component across many industries, and video game development is certainly not absent from this trend. While several publishers are accelerating the push to integrate AI tools into their studios, the inconsistent results and the associated concerns over job displacement for human artists and developers continue to make this push highly controversial.</p>



<p>However, with the right approach, AI can deliver some frankly impressive results in video games, as highlighted in a new video showcasing an AI remake of the beloved The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>This AI remake was created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aillusory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aillusory</a></strong>, who titled their project <em>“The Witcher 3 but it's AI slop - Reimagined by AI.”</em> Despite the creator’s self-deprecating label, this fan project utilized AI to generate photorealistic visuals from footage captured from the original game, overhauling nearly every visual element—from environments to characters. </p>



<p>The results are not perfect, but it's undeniable that this AI remake looks impressive more often than not. It largely retains the original game's recognizable art style for both environments and characters while enhancing them in a fairly credible, photorealistic fashion.</p>



<p>The end results are so impressive that users are consistently praising them. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"AI will first become the best reshade filter, before it's used to make games,"</em> said YouTube commenter misapheonix, a sentiment that is easy to share, considering the quality of this AI-powered remake.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regardless of potential AI enhancements, an official, CD Projekt RED-developed remake of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is likely years away. The original game has aged quite well, and its visuals continue to improve thanks to the dedication of the modding community. Known modder Halk Hogan announced last month that a new version of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-2026-announced-with-new-trailer/"><strong>HD Reworked Project is scheduled to launch in 2026.</strong></a></p>



<p>Despite the lack of an immediate official overhaul, we will see more of Geralt of Rivia in the future. Besides hopefully appearing in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher IV</strong></a>, the White Wolf will return in the complete remake of the first entry in the series. Developed by Fool's Theory, this remake promises to breathe new life into one of the most iconic RPGs released in the early 2000s, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complete with improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">a host of other enhancements.</strong></a> The official release window for this remake remains unknown.</p>

As the name suggests, the Spooky Update was originally intended to launch sometime around Halloween.</p><p>In terms of new content, you're getting a brand new map, a new character to play as, and a new weapon to use, as well as new items to collect, new enemies and bosses to fight, and new achievements to give you even more motivation to blast your way through <em>Megabonk</em>'s hordes.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you've been struggling with <em>Megabonk</em>'s performance as you move into the late game, you'll be pleased to note that the Spooky Update also adds "a lot of improvements to FPS late-game", so hopefully, you shouldn't be quite so beset by lag now.</p><p>That's all in addition to tons of new bug fixes and gameplay tweaks that should improve the way <em>Megabonk </em>works under the hood.

<p>Announced, seemingly a bit ahead of time judging by the trailer being an unlisted video, by a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the update's since been <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000587226904744392">acknowledged by developers GSC themselves</a> via some eye emojis and <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000593761798336770">confirmation</a> that it'll also be coming to PC.</p>
<p>The update's story takes place across eight new quests which GSC stress "can take hours to complete", with new locations and characters waiting for you along the way. Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," reads the tale's synopsis. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>"Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong." To get started, you'll need to listen out for an emergency transmission which'll seemingly lead you towards the Red Forest.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can't have a new quest without a new gun, so the update's introducing the GP37V2 rifle - a GP37 which had had a suppressor stuck to it and been messed with so it only fires single shots or bursts. GSC stress that its uber-tactical nature means it's suited to the most tactically tactical of tacticians. You can also just take along your tried and tested old gun.</p>
<p>Finally the update can end up adding a new hub to the Burning Forest, where you'll be able to rest for a bit before heading back out. It sounds like whether you get this extra chill spot will depend on which choices you make as you investigate the mysterious signal.</p>
<p>If it's been a few months since your last trip to the zone, make sure to check out James' rundown of what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-expedition-update-brings-a-life-improvements-harder-difficulty-options-and-worsens-bandits-eyesight">last month's update</a> - dubbed Expedition - did with regards to A-Life improvements, as well as making your life both easier and harder.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-idea-tab-becomes-the-cheapest-android-tablet-with-a-holiday-discount-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000653357</link>
            <guid>1383589</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets make it incredibly easy to stay both productive and entertained on the go. These are also great for students who don’t want to carry a huge laptop to college and are looking to take notes or work on assignments digitally. The Lenovo Idea Tab does an excellent job at that, and Amazon is letting you pick one up without spending a ton.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It typically goes for around $240, but thanks to a nice 25% discount, you can grab yourself one for just $180.</a> The tablet comes with a pen for easy navigation, plus a folio case, which makes it safe to carry around. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it’s likely to ship after Christmas. If that’s not an issue, we suggest jumping on the discount as soon as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>
<p>The tablet flaunts an 11-inch 2.5K IPS touchscreen display. It delivers sharp visuals while actively reducing blue light emission to keep the screen comfortable on the eyes; great for exam season, where you might need to pull all-nighters with it. The display is nicely paired with immersive sound, thanks to quad Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers. You will be able to take online lectures comfortably, while still enjoying your study breaks by squeezing in an episode of Stranger Things to take your mind off complicated maths problems.</p>
<p>Four learning apps – including Lenovo AI Note, Squid, Nebo, and MyScript Calculator – come built in. These let you write down important points during the lecture, organize tasks, sketch some diagrams, and perform basic mathematical calculations without needing to install another program. Performing quick Google searches has never been easier, either. A quick circle around items or text pulls up the answers you’re looking for, and it even translates content into your preferred language without switching to another app. The included Lenovo Tab Pen takes the experience even further. It makes it quite convenient to scroll, swipe, draw, and jot thoughts down.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes is a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor working tirelessly to keep everything running smoothly. The 8GB memory lets you do a bunch (using multiple applications, switching tabs) without experiencing noticeable slowdowns, while the 256 GB built-in storage offers plenty of space to store all your important files and programs. You will be able to keep all your essential programs, group presentations, final year projects, and more in a single place without feeling limited.</p>
<p>As for the battery, you can expect around 12 hours of continuous use on a single charge. That’s enough to go at least two days without worrying about plugging it in. And finally, the included case lets you prop the thing up anywhere you want, with stability. You can use it in the classroom, cafeteria, on your way back home, and even on the couch easily.</p>
<p>All of these features come together to make the Lenovo Idea Tab one of the best tablets for students and work professionals on the market. It’s made to handle work and play efficiently, and the long battery life makes it quite easy to carry with you when you’re out and about. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">Be sure to grab it before the deal expires if you want to avoid paying the full $240 for it. Once the discount is gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of studio at Crystal Dynamics has revealed that players don’t need to do homework with previous games before jumping into Tomb Raider: The Catalyst. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 made dreams come true for Tomb Raider fans with not one, but two new game announcements. The first is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original 1996&nbsp;title</a>, arriving during the franchise’s 30th anniversary. The other is a brand new chapter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes Lara Croft to northern India</a>. We have now received some new details for the latest chapter. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-catalyst-is-the-largest-game-for-the-franchise-to-date">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the ‘Largest Game’ for the Franchise To Date</h2>



<p>During a virtual Q&amp;A session attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/tomb-raider-catalyst-is-crystal-dynamics-largest-lara-croft-game-yet-and-theres-no-homework-required-to-jump-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics Head of Studio, Scot Amos, provided more details about Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Amos first spoke about the timeline, revealing that the game is set in “the furthest point in [Lara Croft’s] career”. This is where the character is right now, and “everything else is her history”. However, even though this is the furthest point, new players don’t need to play the previous games before Catalyst. </p>



<p>Amos explains that Tomb Raider Catalyst has been designed in a way where new players “can jump in right now and pick up with her adventures as is, like I say, there’s no homework required.” Players who try the new game will feel “this [is a] complete adventure top to bottom, and understand the story and the characters without having to know any of that pre-history.”</p>



<p>The head of studio also revealed that this is “the largest Tomb Raider” that they have ever created, and they are excited about bringing this experience to everyone. The game also features “really vast and varied landscapes as well that are just begging to be explored.”</p>







<p>In other news, Tomb Raider co-creator says he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prefers new chapters over the remake</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien star</a>&nbsp;is in talks to feature in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series.

However, if you buy the Switch 1 version and then grab the free upgrade pack, it'll only cost you <strong>$24.99 / £22.49</strong> until <strong>7th January 2026</strong>. So save some pennies and grab the Switch 1 version!</p>
<p>Larian, clearly riding on a high after its showcase for a new Divinity game at The Game Awards last week, are treating fans to a sparkly version of the critically-acclaimed CRPG. We don't know what the Switch 2 Edition adds to the experience besides higher resolutions and a better frame rate; can we hope for Mouse Mode?</p>
<p>Here's a little flavour text about the game, just in case you missed out on this pre-Baldur's Gate 3 classic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Baldur’s Gate 3, experience the world of Divinity in this epic adventure where your choices shape fate itself.</p>
<p>The Divine is dead. The Void approaches. And the powers lying dormant within you are soon to awaken. Choose your role in a BAFTA-winning story, and explore a world that reacts to who you are, and the choices you make. With five races to choose from, and an adventure playable solo or as a party of up to four, lay waste to an oppressive order in a world afraid of magic. Become the God the world so desperately needs.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition is the most complete version of the best-selling, Metacritic Must-Play RPG.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The game was already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">brilliant on Switch</a>, so we're excited to dive in and lose another hundred hours to this behemoth.</p>

			<p>As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets. When Sleep Awake was first announced, the names involved left me anticipating a thrilling and subversive narrative backed up by a thumping industrial soundtrack. The actual game we got certainly ticks those boxes to some degree, but is it another success story for Blumhouse Games after the excellent Fear The Spotlight?</p>
<p><iframe title="Do. Not. Sleep... SLEEP AWAKE is Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gogkM13Cqcc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developers Eyes Out state on their website that they “believe in a powerful synaesthesia emerging from music, narrative, and interactive experiences,” and this manifesto perfectly explains the nature of Sleep Awake. Mixing traditional first person exploration with surreal live action cutscenes, and with all the action being accompanied by a superbly varied and atmospheric score, Sleep Awake takes the ‘walking simulator’ and makes it far more cinematic in scope and feel. It feels strange that this title hasn’t been released on VR devices to be honest. Regardless, it is essential that you play this through decent headphones if you can.</p>


<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a strange world that has been ravaged by the Hush, a mysterious presence that steals away anybody who falls asleep. The few remaining survivors of this nocturnal apocalypse must find new ways to stay awake by whatever means necessary, but different sects have very different ideas of how to do this. You play as Katja, a young girl who uses combinations of herbs to concoct eyedrops to stave off tiredness whilst other groups prefer pain and/or bodily mutilation to achieve the same goal. Your first actions in the game are to find the herbs around your flat in order to make such a tincture, a tutorial section that works well to immerse you into the game’s world. Once you have made the drops you set out to deliver them to Amma, and then the strangeness really begins.</p>


<p>At times, Sleep Awake is visually stunning with neon drenched skylines and dingy, dilapidated buildings at ground level. Other areas feel a little more repetitive but there isn’t much backtracking so the game is always pushing you forward to see new things. Enemies are present but act as moving obstacles rather than antagonists with their presence mostly restricted to several scripted chase sequences and thankfully short stealth sections. The vibe here is very much that of a walking simulator with occasional horror and puzzles to mix things up.</p>
<p>The narrative in Sleep Awake is mostly relayed through environmental storytelling (and Katja’s frequent monologues in response to said environment) but there are also microfiches to find that reveal some of the backstory and lore of the world. There are also spiritual echoes called void shadows left by some taken by the Hush. Katja is able to tap into these shadows and reveal the trapped memories within. Whilst it is never really explained &nbsp;how she is able to do this, the latter parts of the game point to some kind of family connection to the Hush, a connection that is clearly foreshadowing for future entries in the Sleep Awake universe.</p>
<p>This points to one of the most divisive aspects of the game – it feels very much like the prologue to a greater story and, as such, is quite a short experience. I took my time and found almost every collectable and still didn’t get to the five hour mark.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here, I’m not arguing that games have to meet a minimum number of hours to be considered worthwhile (indeed I’ve given high scores to many shorter and more focused titles) but the story here feels like it stops just as it starts to get going. The pacing within those five hours is a little uneven as so much happens towards the end that the game before it feels more like an opening chapter. I hope that Blumhouse support Eyes Out to continue the story but recent experiences in the world of game development leave me apprehensive.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There's a lot of promise to Sleep Awake, which makes its short runtime all the more frustrating.&nbsp;The fusion of visuals, music, and narrative are reminiscent of peak Remedy titles and the inevitable cliffhanger ending definitely leaves me wanting to find out more about Katja’s story. I’ll be listening to that Robin Finck soundtrack in the meantime and crossing my fingers.	</p></div>

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-revealed-by-larian-studios-who-probably-watched-the-wicker-man-recently/">Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards</a> (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-could-be-imminent-following-sequel-announcement/">some rumours swirling</a>), Larian Studio has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2 –&nbsp;Definitive Edition</a> is now available on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with free upgrades for existing owners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Now Available On Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, &amp; PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Larian’s original fantasy setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was an acclaimed sequel to the studio’s turn-based RPG revival through the 2010s – a revival that eventually led to the even more acclaimed and beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>!</p>
<p>While Larian hasn’t dug into the technical details, you can expect that this upgraded release will offer improved resolutions and frame rates compared to the game on original Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. There was already support for 4K on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but native versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S should allow for 60fps.This isn’t a remake or remaster, just a fairly simple port.</p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now simply a cross-buy PS5 and PS4 game – i<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP3383-PPSA06866_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5">t’s also on sale for £12.49</a> right now!</li>
<li>On Xbox One and Series X|S the game is now cross-gen – <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6">it’s on sale for £14.52</a> currently.</li>
<li>On Switch 2, however, you’ll want to head to the Nintendo eShop and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2988295.html">search for the free upgrade pack</a> if you own the game on original Switch. The RRP is £44.99 for the game on Switch 2, but <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Definitive-Edition-1633057.html">you can currently buy the Switch 1 edition for £22.49</a> and then upgrade for free, so…. uh…. go and do that instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>While free in most locations, Japan has a nominal ¥100 fee on Switch and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2025’s Break-Out Roguelite Megabonk Gets, Er, Spooky For The Holidays]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/megabonk-update-patch-vampire-survivors-2000653410</link>
            <guid>1383538</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Megabonk</em>, a 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>that became one of 2025’s surprise hits, has somewhat belatedly released its Halloween update just in time for the winter holidays. But hey, Christmas has always been spook-adjacent, right? There’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,&nbsp;<em>Krampus</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>…</p> <p>“yoo I’ve finally finished the update I was working on,” said solo developer Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791474891212&amp;emgid=523110495538905880">in a post on Steam</a>. “Was originally going to be a small halloween update, but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than I initially planned.” He goes on to list the new content added in the Spooky Update:</p>

 <ul> <li>New Map</li> <li>New Character</li> <li>New Weapon</li> <li><wbr>New Items</li> <li><wbr>New Enemies and Bosses</li> <li><wbr>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li> </ul> <p><em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is an unabashed reinterpretation of Poncle’s <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, albeit with a few original twists of its own, not least that it’s now a 3D, third-person action game. It came out in September this year and absolutely exploded in popularity almost right away. And deservedly so! <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591">It’s a great game, even if most of its ideas aren’t entirely original</a>. It also came out a couple of months ahead of Poncle announcing its own reinterpretation of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> as a 3D version of itself</a>, although in that case it’s also being combined with a deckbuilding roguelite.</p>

 <p>Alongside the new elements listed above, the Spooky Update also comes with a bunch of bug fixes, some new “advanced” settings for very niche tweaks, and a host of balancing changes. There’s also access to the game’s console, with the intention of making the game more open to speedrunning. And even this update has since received an update, fixing a few issues the spookiness introduced.</p> <p>The game’s well worth checking out. A lot of people already have, to the degree that it was nominated in this year’s Best Debut Indie Game category at the Game Awards, before the pseudonymous developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">withdraw it from consideration on the basis that it’s not really his first game</a>. (Something <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">the category’s eventual winners</a> did&nbsp;<em>not</em> choose to do.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g-driving-force-shifter-drops-to-its-lowest-price-ever-compatible-with-racing-wheels-and-pedals-for-xbox-ps5-and-pc-2000653077</link>
            <guid>1383535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Forza Horizon 5 making its way to the PS5 earlier this year, now’s the perfect time to jump in and enjoy one of the standout racing games of this generation. To elevate the experience even further, you’ll want the right gear—something that makes it feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is currently seeing a major price drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/">Normally $60 on Amazon, it’s now discounted by 17%, bringing the cost down to just $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>As funny as it would be to use the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter alongside a standard controller, I’m afraid that’s not possible. This product is part of a larger kit. Logitech’s G Series racing setup is crafted for maximum realism with a driving wheel, pedals, and this optional shifter. Real race cars are manual, not automatic. So if you want to complete your driving simulation setup, you’ll need this last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter is compatible with Logitech G29 and G290 Driving Force Racing Wheels in order to enhance your experience behind the wheel. The shifter plugs in via cable to the rear side of your Logitech driving wheel.</p>
<p>You get real, quality construction that has the weight and feel of an actually shifter you might find in your own vehicle. It’s made with a solid steel gear shaft. The knob and boot are covered in a high-quality hand-stitched leather, which makes it look and feel like the real deal. It’s also durable and can put off wear and tear for a long time.</p>
<p>The shifter can be securely mounted to your driving rig. The lever is designed to be grabbed and pulled around, so the whole unit needs to be able to hold it’s ground while you race. That’s why it has built-in clamps and bolt points. The clamps just twist on either side to screw into a secure fit, then you push down the knobs to lock it into place. Easy peasy.</p>



<h2>Ultimate Precision</h2>
<p>Using the six-speed shifter is fluid. You’re met with a satisfying, tactile click as you shift between each gear. You’ll be able to execute smooth, accurate gear transitions whether you’re speeding up down a straight away or coming out of a turn. Pull down to put your rig in reverse.</p>
<p>Aside from just enhancing your experience playing a racing game, a driving sim like this makes for a not so bad method of learning to be behind the wheel. Particularly if you’ve only ever driven automatic, this can provide a safe way to learn how to drive stick. If you travel a lot, especially in Europe, you’ll find that renting an automatic is far more expensive than renting manual. Plus, you’ll have a lot more options of vehicle choice with manual. It’s a good skill set to have.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot devs have just revealed the release window for Daima Pack Part 2, along with details on the new content. </p>



<p>Back in February 2025, developers revealed that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot will receive Daima—Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack as additional DLC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-dlc-part-1-and-2-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across two packs</a>. The first pack was released in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-has-revealed-new-daima-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025</a>. The release window for the second pack has now been announced, and it is arriving early next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-in-early-2026-with-mini-vegeta">Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Daima Pack Part 2 Arrives in Early 2026 with Mini Vegeta</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-early-2026-new-character-and-fresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Bandai Namco reveals that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack part 2 will release in 2026. This new pack will add Vegeta (mini) as a new playable character, along with a new boss fight against Tamagami Number Two, and new enemies from the demon realm. The announcement also came with a new trailer showcasing Mini Vegeta’s moveset and Super Saiyan 3 transformations. They also revealed Tamagami Number Two’s Skills along with the other enemies. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players will also face two new enemy types as they explore the First Demon World. The first enemy type is the Gendarmerie Tank, known for its heavy hitting and powerful ranged and charged attacks. The other enemy type is Gendarmerie Officers, strong enemies that can summon reinforcements and attack from every angle. </p>



<p>From the looks of it, the Daima DLC might not end with the second part, as we are yet to see Goku’s glorious Super Saiyan 4 transformation arrive for the game, which was teased at the very end of the new trailer. </p>

<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Larian Studios announced the next game in the long-running Divinity franchise. And with the new game on the mind of players, Larian has decided to give owners of Divinity: Original Sin 2—the last game in the series—a free update.</p>



<p>Available starting today, Larian has released a Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<p>Details on what the free update entails from a technology standpoint haven’t been revealed just yet. The only thing certainly known is that, for PlayStation players, the game it’s PS5 Pro optimized. When more details become available on what the optimizations are and differences from the base version, they’ll be added to this story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Released originally in 2017, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a sequel to 2014’s Original Sin. While the games are intertwined a bit, Larian has said that Original Sin 2 is a “standalone game and can be experienced on its own.” However, they “ecommend trying out Divinity: Original Sin for the best experience!”</p>



<p>The premise of the second game in the Original Sin subseries is you playing in a world where the Gods are dead. Your player holds powers of a “forbidden magic”, and you find yourself quarantined because of it.</p>







<p>“The Magisters of the Divine Order want to “cure” you of your powers,” the description reads. “But the Order has secrets of its own. Secrets that threaten everyone. If the world remains godless, chaos will rule.”</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > GSC Game World [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> will release a free content update for <em><a title="Games > S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a></em> on December 16 featuring a new storyline with eight new quests, seven new locations, six new characters, a new weapon, and a new hub, the developer <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1015235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via GSC Game World:</p><blockquote><p><strong>So What is This New <a title="Platforms > Quest [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>?</strong></p><p>Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p><p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Never Forget About Your Gear</strong></p><p>No stalker embarks on an expedition unprepared. That’s where the new weapon comes in handy.</p><p>The GP37V2 is a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players.</p><p>It features a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope. The trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p><p>The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skillful operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power. And even if that somehow doesn’t sound like the best fit for your playstyle — you still have 30+ weapons (plus attachments) in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 to choose your favorite from.</p><p><strong>New Locations and Places</strong></p><p>As a bounty hunter, you need to explore, loot, and survive. Believe us when we say that the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine in Red Forest are worth your time.</p><p>If you have already travelled the Zone south-to-north and east-to-west, you’ll see some familiar locations are now re-inhabited by stalkers. The story will lead you through Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p><p>Your choices may also lead you to completely uncharted places. Trust your instincts to see how it pays off.</p><p><strong>New Hub in the Burnt Forest Region</strong></p><p>Your choice matters in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>—-and it literally shapes and changes the Zone. It stays true in this new story, as one of the outcomes is a whole new hub appearing in a not-so-populated area of Burnt Forest. Technician, trader, medic, guide—-everyone will be there. Of course, including a place to take a nap, and your stash!</p></blockquote><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,079 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chernobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-windows/9N3D6V4N58JR" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-free-story-content-update-launches-december-16]]></content:encoded>

                <p>At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/" data-ref-id="5000-706357">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it.</p><p>The game is in early development and still a long way off (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">but reportedly due before 2030</a>), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_">Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_platforms">Fate of the Old Republic platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_preorders">Fate of the Old Republic preorders</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_story__setting__and_characters">Fate of the Old Republic story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Hudson_s_history">Hudson's history</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_many_Star_Wars_games">One of many Star Wars games</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game.</p><p>Amid speculation that Fate of the Old Republic may not release until 2030, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">Hudson assured fans that won't be the case.</a> "Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" rel="nofollow ">Hudson wrote online</a>. "Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!"</p><h2 id="Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_"><strong>Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</strong></h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Arcanaut Studios, a team based in Edmonton with another office in Kelowna, British Columbia. The studio said its "mission is to create magical, interactive storytelling by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools in a safe and rewarding environment."</p><p>The studio said one of its goals is to "push the boundaries of what is possible," and that the team does not "fear failure."</p><p>"We are doers. We're not passengers. We are drivers,"<a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> the developer's website says</a>.</p><p>Hudson is the CEO and game director at Arcanaut, and his management team includes Chris Bain as CFO, Cordy Rierson as COO, and Ryan Hoyle as CTO. The developer's website states that people who worked at Microsoft, Epic, Remedy, The Coalition, and ZeniMax make up the current team.</p><p>As mentioned, Arcanaut was only just founded in July 2025, so it's a very new studio, and the developer said the game is in "early development." The developer is collaborating with the Star Wars rights-owner, Lucasfilm, on the project.</p><h2 id="Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was released at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025.

He joined BioWare in 1998 and worked there for more than 16 years. He is best known for directing 2003's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and 2007's Mass Effect. He also directed Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. In 2015, Hudson joined Xbox to work on the "mixed reality" team, but he left after two years to re-join BioWare. In his second stint at BioWare, Hudson worked on Anthem and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, before leaving again in 2021 to start a new studio, Humanoid Origin, which was making a AAA sci-fi game. The studio closed in November 2024, due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/" data-ref-id="1100-6528039">"unexpected shortfall of funding."</a></p><h2 id="One_of_many_Star_Wars_games"><strong>One of many Star Wars games</strong></h2><p>Long gone are the days when Electronic Arts had the exclusive license for Star Wars games on console/PC. These days, Disney and Lucasfilm are partnered with numerous different game studios on a variety of different projects. In addition to Fate of the Old Republic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/#1" data-ref-id="2900-3917">some of the other upcoming Star Wars games</a> include a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars Eclipse, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a new game from Uncharted boss Amy Henning, among others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, the Game Awards surprised us with not one, but two Tomb Raider-related announcements: Catalyst, a new entry in the series, and Legacy of Atlantis, a remake of the original Tomb Raider. With a legacy as long as Lara Croft's, however, it raises some questions. First, how do these games fit in a larger timeline?</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/"><em>GamesRadar+</em> got the scoop on that</a>. "From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld," game director Will Kerslake told the outlet. "With the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we're seeing a more experienced Lara Croft."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This means the most recent trilogy of games – Tomb Raider (2013), Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider – occurs sometime before the original 1996 game. By extension, that means they all come before Legacy of Atlantis as well. This is consistent with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_gO4xj5u9k">an update the Tomb Raider team put out back in 2021</a>, when Kerslake said, "We envision the future of Tomb Raider in all its forms as unfolding in a time beyond these established adventures, telling stories that build upon the breadth of both Core Design’s and Crystal Dynamics’ games and working to unify these timelines."</p><p>This new duo of games is still serving as a soft reboot, however, which is partially evident by the recasting of the title character. Alix Wilton Regan replaces Camilla Luddington as the voice of Lara Croft in both Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis, tying the games together as the new future of the Tomb Raider series.&nbsp;</p><p>In a press Q&amp;A session following the Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics head of studio Scot Amos spoke about the casting process for the new era. "[Alix Wilton Regan] was already a fan when we met her. And then being able to talk to her, and [we got] a sense that she has that wit and that charm and charisma that is a natural essence and core for Lara, but she also has that confidence and that depth of emotionality that we need for telling these great stories."</p>

<p>Amos also broke down how the development process of Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis is surprisingly intertwined. "We actually have two distinct development teams, so we're working together," Amos says. "But we have Flying Wild Hog running the Legacy of Atlantis, and we have the Crystal [Dynamics] team from the core working on Catalyst. But we're connected. We actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets. We have one leadership team, visionary team, over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling."</p><p>It also emphasizes the "unity" the teams are trying to achieve with Lara Croft going forward. "Same character; Two different time periods in her life," Kerslake says during the Q&amp;A.</p><p>For more Tomb Raider, check out the reveals of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-takes-lara-croft-to-northern-india-in-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="00d416d9-e569-40af-805a-22822aae745c" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Catalyst </a>and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-a-remake-of-the-first-game-in-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22919195-3e7d-45ff-9ee7-9d0fc3924b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Legacy of Atlantis</a> from last week's Game Awards.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/tomb-raider-devs-explain-series-timeline-lara-crofts-new-voice-and-links-between]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> now has current gen versions available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Larian's previous RPG, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, was already available on Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. But now it's available on newer platforms with higher resolution and increased framerate. There's also a free upgrade available if you already own the game.</p>
<p>The shadow drop follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">leak last week of a PS5 version of the Definitive Edition of the game</a>, so this isn't totally out of the blue.</p>

<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 was first released in 2017 for PC, with PS4, Xbox One, Switch and iPad versions following. While already available to play on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, it's been via backwards compatibility only.</p>
<p>"Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse on the leak last week.</p>
<p>That leak arrived alongside new trademarks for the Divinity franchise, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">pre-empted Larian's announcement at The Game Awards that the studio is developing a new Divinity game</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement finally solved the mystery of the strange statue in the Mojave Desert. Revealed with a gruesome trailer, Divinity is going to be even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>Until then, it seems Larian is keen for players to revisit a refreshed Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-a-17-3%e2%80%b3-laptop-to-holiday-deals-at-nearly-70-off-with-399-worth-of-free-accessories-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-windows-11-pro-2000653266</link>
            <guid>1383496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tech purchases tend to be expensive, but they don’t have to be – if you know where to look for the best deals. Our team scans the internet for the top discounts that are actually worth your money, and those for a reliable everyday laptop under $800; we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">The 17-inch HP laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) can be yours for just $760 at Amazon, after the retailer took an unbelievable 67% off its usual $2,200 price.</a> It’s a straightforward discount, so you don’t need to worry about entering any complicated coupon codes or following twisted checkout steps to score it. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The bundle comes with a free accessory kit worth almost $400, too, which sweetens the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>Starting off with the freebies; you’re getting an external CD/DVD drive, a Redragon mouse, a clean cloth, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. All of this is useful, but we especially like how you’re getting an efficient OS installed and ready to go. Microsoft has packed the system with a bunch of productivity and security tools that are specifically made keeping remote workers and creatives in mind. Windows 11 typically comes with specific installation requirements, but having it pre-installed means you can skip that entire setup hassle and get started with using it right away.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, it’s got a nice, expansive 17.3-inch Full HD screen that delivers stunning clarity and vibrant colors consistently. The anti-glare panel reduces reflections for a more comfortable viewing experience in all lighting situations, whether you’re using the machine out there in the sun or in your room at night. There’s a built-in HD camera with a physical privacy shutter right at the top of the screen for better video calls, too.</p>



<p>Those who need to type long documents frequently will appreciate the ergonomic keyboard that features soft keys to reduce finger and wrist fatigue during long sessions. It’s even got a dedicated Microsoft Copilot key for instant AI-powered assistance 24/7. Battery life is another strong selling point, as it delivers up to 7 hours of usage on a single charge. That translates into going an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever either, as HP Fast Charge boosts your battery from 0% to 50% in just about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop runs on an Intel Core i3-N305 8-Core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 3.8 GHz. There’s 32 RAM to keep things running smoothly, and it’s especially great for multitaskers who prefer juggling at least a few tasks at the same time. It keeps noticeable slowdowns at bay, even when things get intense. Storage is made easy with the 1TB SSD. It’s not only spacious, but also gets you fast boot/transfer times, helping you stay productive throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this HP laptop, especially at its current price of $760.</a> For well under $1,000, you’re getting a machine that’s ideal for work professionals, creatives, students, and even casual users. It’s a limited-time discount that somehow managed to crawl through Black Friday, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to snap it up as quick as you can, as we’re expecting the offer to expire soon.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider’s co-creator has commented on the new remake, Legacy of Atlantis, revealing that he prefers new chapters. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a fantastic event for Tomb Raider fans.

Cold Snap adds cold-weather survival mechanics fueled by snowstorms across Speranza. Snowfall reduces visibility, lakes freeze over, and the open surface becomes even more dangerous. Exposure to extreme cold causes frostbite, thus encouraging new strategies around healing items, loadouts, and indoor shelter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap gameplay changes, from Embark Studios:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Environmental Hazard:</strong> Cold, harsh weather introduces new risks for raiders who remain outdoors too long. Players must watch out for frostbite, a creeping condition that slowly drains their health bar. </li><li><strong>Shelter Mechanics:</strong> To prevent frostbite, raiders will need to adapt their tactics as the cold gradually seeps into their bones. Raiders must rethink their loadouts, ensuring they can heal themselves or their teammates and plan their extractions with care, finding shelter if needed.</li><li><strong>Visual Overhaul:</strong> Frost buildup, frozen lakes, snow accumulation and more across Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport and The Blue Gate maps.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, unique loot and rewards are available through the Flickering Flames event and Candleberry Banquet project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flickering Flames Event:</strong> An act of endurance and patience that tests Raiders’ survival skills during the Cold Snap. Raiders can unlock rewards across 25 levels, including new gear, customizations elements and Raider Tokens by earning Merits, which are automatically gained from XP in rounds. To activate the event, Raiders must have played five rounds of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Candleberry Banquet Project:</strong> A new project that brings Raiders together to feel the fragile warmth that shines through the frigid cold. Raiders can earn rewards by scavenging unique items topside and collecting Candleberries. It features five stages, each revealing a new scene on the banquet table. Completing stages grants rewards such as cosmetic items, Raider Tokens and Merits, with Merits contributing progress in the Flickering Flames event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting December 26, the Goalie Raider deck will be included in the base game. The new deck includes new items and feats for players to complete, offering rewards such as Raider tokens, cosmetic items and more. These include a hockey-inspired Raider outfit in several color variants, along with a hockey stick Raider tool.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Expedition Project Raider Reset lets players restart their journey with certain buffs, advantages, and rewards. The Expedition Project will provide Raiders with an opportunity to undergo a reset, bringing a new raider and a new story for the player. This optional reset is unlocked by collecting key materials to build a Caravan for the existing Raider then signing up for the departure during the Expedition window. By departing, players will reset their character progress for a new Arc Raiders journey with exclusive buffs, advantages and rewards that carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/de/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Embark explained why it’s doing the seasonal reset. “Progression wipes are a notoriously difficult thing to balance in online multiplayer games — we get that,” the developer said. “Mandatory global wipes have some obvious benefits: heavily invested players get to re-experience the initial grind once again and, for a time, the playing field is levelled. The optional Expedition Project is our solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes — specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game. We want to offer you the choice:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not completed as much as you’d like? Keep on raiding, building, and growing. Ready for a new challenge and to grind once again? Depart on the Expedition, and receive buffs, rewards, and bragging rights.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap update release times:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios launches Cold Snap on Tuesday, December 16, at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap includes limited-time events and elements running from Tuesday, December 16 until Tuesday, January 13, 2026 at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap is the last update listed as part of Arc Raiders' 2025 content roadmap, and Embark has yet to outline what's coming in 2026.
