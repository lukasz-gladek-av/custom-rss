            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We’re in the first video game console generation where prices are going up instead of coming down. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-deal-discount-tariffs-xbox-switch-2-trump-1851778878">It’s rough out there</a>, especially if you were someone who was waiting on the sidelines for the right deal before finally buying a Nintendo Switch or upgrading to a PS5. But the good news is that even if <em>new</em> consoles keep getting more expensive, used versions have never been more affordable.</p> <p>If you asked me for the best deal in gaming right now, I’d probably say the Switch Lite. It arrived back in 2019 and as low-end dedicated gaming handhelds go, it performs decently well. Best of all, it has access to one of the best gaming libraries ever assembled. If you’ve never owned a Switch before, you can instantly start playing anything from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and<em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> to <em>Hades</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> on one of the most convenient form factors around. The only downside is that despite coming out six years ago, it’s never received a price cut. In fact, following Nintendo’s latest price hikes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">response to tariffs</a>, it’s now $230 to buy new.</p> <p>Used, however, you can get one in decent shape for just $100. According to reseller pricing data logged on <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite-gray">Price Charts</a>, that’s around the lowest it’s ever been, and prices don’t seem likely to spike again in the near future. It’s a similar story for the base model Switch with the blue and red Joy-Con. Recently raised to $340 new, you can get one for <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-with-blue-and-red-joy-con-version-2">less than half that used</a>. Prices for other older used consoles are also at all-time lows. A 1TB PS4 Slim hovers just above $100 right now. The cheapest Xbox One right now is just $98. Some of the newer consoles have decent used discounts as well.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614754">Price Charts / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Lets start with the Xbox Series S. It launched at $300, was frequently on sale for $250, and is now going for $380 new at GameStop. That’s nuts! The whole point of the Series S is that it can’t play discs or run games at 4K but it can give you convenient access to all of the great stuff that rotates through Game Pass. Used, however, the Series S remains a great bargain. While it once dipped down to as low as $160 in 2023, it’s still easy to find second-hand <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-s-console">for around $200</a>. That makes it the cheapest way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to Xbox this month. <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-x-1tb-console">At around $375</a>, a used Xbox Series X is nearly double the price, but still way less than its current $600 MSRP.</p> <p>The PS5 is, surprisingly, an even better used deal than the Series X, probably in part because there’s way more of them floating around in the first place. Sony hasn’t raised the prices on its hardware in the U.S. yet and you can still grab one of the new <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 slim bundles for just $450. Used, the slim with a disc drive <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-slim-disc-edition">runs about $330</a>, while the all-digital base PS5 can be found <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-console-digital-version">for $300 or lower</a>. That’s only a third off the sticker price, but still not bad. At $70 each, that’s the same as buying both<em> Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> new this fall.</p> <p>There’s sometimes been a stigma around buying used consoles. GameStop refusing to price them competitively is part of that. You also don’t always know how well looked-after a system was. Has it been overheating from dust-clogged fans? <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470">Is it infested with bugs</a>? My personal experience with used consoles in the modern era has been quite positive, though. A used Xbox One I purchased in the mid aughts lasted me until I traded it in toward my Series S. A Switch I bought on Facebook last Christmas for just $200 (it also included <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and Switch Sports) still feels practically brand new.</p> <p>The only used console you can’t get a deal on right now is the Switch 2. Even pre-owned versions are going for over the current $450 MSRP. It’ll probably only get worse if and when Nintendo eventually raises that price as well. Fortunately, at least for now, most of the games worth playing on Switch 2 are still available on Switch 1.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/05/gamesir-x5-lite-mobile-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamesir-x5-lite-mobile-controller-review.1262835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s plenty of mobile games that make the most of their touchscreen input, but if you’re wanting to play action titles or stream something over Game Pass or Luna, you probably want a controller. Now, you can prop your phone up against something, and use a Bluetooth equipped controller like the official Xbox one, or the PS5’s DualSense, and it’ll work admirably well, but something like the GameSir X5 Lite Type-C is going to turn your phone into a perfect little portable, and it’s an ideal option if you’re looking for mobile gaming on a budget.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir X5 Lite — Wider. Lighter. Comfier. | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQuacraRpMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a clamp-style device, with two generous controller grips tethered by an expandable plastic backplate. In between the two controller portions is where you slot your phone, stretching the X5 Lite out and connecting it to your phone via the USB-C socket at one end. There’s a good deal of give here, and you can play with a range of phones or small tablets up to 213mm, so long as they’re equipped with USB Type-C. This means that even an iPad Mini can be slotted into place. There’s no alternative Bluetooth connection, so that’s it, but there is a USB-C port so you can also charge your device while playing. It’s worth noting that this isn’t capable of sending data though, in case you were looking for passthrough for other connections.</p>


<p>My Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was a perfect fit, and makes the unit look like a handheld console. It also feels rock-solid in your hand, and I had no worries about my phone falling out, or any part of the X5 feeling loose or weak. There’s a selection of rubber grips to make sure you phone is held in place as solidly as possible, but I had no problems with it after removing them entirely to ensure the easiest connection to my phone. It’s not the most attractive device I’ve ever seen, but the black plastic and straightforward, utilitarian looks get the job done.</p>


<p>Given the range of options on Android, from streaming, through native Android games, all the way to a bevy of retro console emulators, this is a great fit for someone who wants full control over their mobile gaming experience, with as little fuss, or extra steps as humanly possible. Slot your phone into the X5 Lite, and away you go.</p>
<p>I’ve done the majority of my testing of the GameSir X5 Lite with Amazon Luna, but it will, of course, work with any mobile titles that are setup for a real controller. That’s meant I’ve been able to dive into a bunch of classic titles that I’ve got squirreled away there, and I thought Watch Dogs 2 might be a fun fit with its stealth-based hacking action. Straight off the bat, the X5 Lite just glides into your hands, with two really comfortable moulded grips making it feel like a full-sized controller. It’s definitely simple and straightforward – there’s only the central inputs you’d expect, and no additional ‘pro’ styled buttons – but it immediately sets out its stall as a device you can spend a decent amount of time with.</p>
<p>Priced at £34.99 in the UK – though available for even less via platforms like AliExpress – the most surprising feature at this price point, and as the ‘Lite’ edition, is the inclusion of Hall Effect sticks. The stick tops are pretty small, so you do feel a slight reduction in grip and control, but the level of weight and tautness is excellent, and with the magnetic technology within, they shouldn’t develop stick drift even if you spend every waking hour playing Call of Duty Mobile.</p>

<p>You can feel the reduction in cost through the missing features – there’s no rumble – and the other inputs, though they all function perfectly well. The four main face buttons are quite tightly packed together, and they’ve been shrunk down to fit the X5’s smaller body, which may affect usability if you’ve got great big thumbs, or you just mash all your buttons at the same time. If your phone has powerful haptic feedback, you may not notice the X5’s lack of rumble, but I found that my Pixel 9 Pro XL just made a horrid buzzing sound whenever the haptics fired or a got a notification, so I made sure to turn it off when gaming.</p>
<p>The D-pad does a good job of getting you through menus, and a run through some classic platformers showed that it’s precise enough for some retro platforming. It wasn’t a great choice for Street Fighter 2 though, and proved too easy to slide off to reliably perform a Hadouken. Whether that’s a dealbreaker for you depends on the type of games you’re planning to play.</p>
<p>I do like the shoulder buttons, which feel nice and solid beneath your fingers, and respond well no matter where you press them, but the triggers are sadly less enjoyable to use, with digital, non-analogue inputs, and a horrible clacking noise with each activation. They’re easily the weakest part of the X5, and if you’re hoping to play a lot of FPS titles, then you might tire of them quite quickly.</p>

<p>GameSir have their own app, which gives you greater control over the X5 Lite and your mobile titles, helping you to update the controller’s firmware, perform input tests, and customise the controls, including altering your dead zones, and shifting between a Nintendo Switch style layout or an Xbox one. There’s three options for game control, with native support recognising the X5 immediately as an input, while hardware mapping and software mapping let you customise inputs if necessary too.</p>
<p>The GameSir app also has its own game library and discovery tool, recommending various titles from Apex Legends through to Genshin Impact, all of which work perfectly with the X5 Lite. It really is designed to make mobile gaming a more viable, and console-like experience, and at this price, it’s certainly worth considering.</p>

<p>It's Fortnite-ing time</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At last, the Power Rangers are making their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> debut later this week on 7th August.</p>
<p>There's been rumours about the Rangers dropping in the free-to-play battle royale for a while, and today's trailer confirms when <em>and</em> what to expect. They'll be landing in-game during Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock 'N Awesome. Oh, and did we mention that the trailer is incredible?</p>
<p>Featuring a blend of CGI and live action, we get an introduction to the Bad Bugs which Fortnite characters are battling in CGI. Then, the Red, Blue, and Yellow Rangers arrive and we get a cut to live action and a change in aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Butt rock music, over-the-top explosions and action, and martial arts-style stunts all accompanied by Peely; it's a little surreal to see the '90s era of Power Rangers alongside iconic Fortnite characters. But goodness, is this trailer great, especially if you grew up watching the show.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the Mighty Morphin Bundle will be hitting the in-game store, where you'll be able to unlock Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger, and Blue Ranger outfits and iconic accessories.</p>
<figure><a title="Power Rangers Fortnite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe5333a75949e/power-rangers-fortnite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're a Battle Pass holder, you'' also have access to a series of quests which kick off on 16th September; completing these will unlock the Dino Megazord outfit. Megazord will also be arriving mid-season for a takeover.</p>
<p>So it sounds like this is a no-brainer for Power Rangers fans, then. That trailer <em>might</em> have some of us downloading the game on Switch 2 right now; that version is pretty good, too!</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Power Rangers in Fortnite in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch.1262817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>When Harold Ryan, former Bungie CEO and president, formed his new studio <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/">ProbablyMonsters</a> in 2016, he remarked how that the aim was to transform how AAA games are developed, hoping to create a more sustainable environment for creators to, well, create in.</p>
<p>Now, the fledgling studio has announced its first two games, one of which is coming to Nintendo Switch. And indeed, it's <em>specifically</em> for Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a> is a side-scrolling roguelike that's due to hit Nintendo's console "this fall" and, as Ryan himself explains in the game's official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games represent the first public expression of the approach we’ve been shaping behind the scenes...We’ve always believed there’s a better way to make games, one that supports original IP, empowers developers, and delivers memorable experiences to players. How we bring games to life has evolved. We’ve had to adapt, and these first two titles reflect a model that’s more focused, flexible, and sustainable. This is just the start, and we’re excited to finally share them with the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all sounds great, and Ryan also points out that, in order to fit the remit, Storm Lancers' run time comes in at a very manageable 10 hours. Music to our ears, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>A quick look around the <a href="https://www.probablymonsters.com/stormlancers/">game's official webpage</a> shows a cartoonish and very colourful-styled adventure that puts us in mind of a side-scrolling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands</a> in a few of the screenshots, and the launch trailer, which you can see above, really does show off some very moreish looking two-player action.</p>
<p>Co-op is where it's at, and judging by how many upgrades and weapons we see in that brief launch trailer, folk who like tinkering their gear and setups before diving into co-operative runs, may well be in for a very good time. Here's some further info from ye olde PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Lancers is a rogue-like game inspired by 1980s anime and cartoons that features combo-focused fights and couch co-op. Led by industry veterans Jim Veevaert (Microsoft, Zynga) and Seth Thompson (Blizzard), Storm Lancers combines fluid combat with unstoppable momentum. Designed to keep the heart racing and reflexes sharpened, the game gives players a sense of adventure constantly on the move. Set in the world of Cryptica, players crash land on a living planet built around a powerful source of reality magic. As they traverse five ever-shifting biomes, each leap, slash, and dash propels them deeper into a vibrant world, only to be met by enemies that adapt to their every move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Storm Lancers can be played solo, the press release really is super keen to point out that it really is designed to shine in couch co-op where, "Two players can team up to explore the alien world together, developing complementary playstyles as they battle through merciless enemies and terrifying bosses.</p>
<p>Along the way, players collect items that transform and define their approach to combat, making each run unique and replayable." So, just like a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow, then.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some screenshots.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Leaks and rumors about the performance of the future PS6 console have significantly increased lately. Last Friday, YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> estimates of the PlayStation 6's rasterization performance, suggesting that it would be three times as fast as the base PlayStation 5, which would put it around the level of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080. Later, the same YouTuber <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the performance uplift during ray tracing operations will be much higher, between five and ten times as fast as the base PS5.</p>



<p>Now, though, AMD insider KeplerL2 has shared different predictions. <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270687172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to him</a>, the PS6 will be around the performance level of the AMD Radeon RX 9070XT, AMD's current flagship GPU. However, the next-generation Xbox will be slightly more powerful, with KeplerL2 comparing it to NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080. Both consoles will be powered by AMD's RDNA 5 architecture, which KeplerL2 reckons will be the largest architectural overhaul since the Graphics Core Next (GCN) era. Additionally, the insider said it will have even more features than NVIDIA's latest architecture, Blackwell; to prove that, the insider linked to several AMD patents:</p>

</ul>



<p>The comment around the next-generation Xbox is interesting because Moore's Law Is Dead has suggested that Microsoft's upcoming console (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powered by the Magnus APU</a>) would be less powerful than the PS6. Microsoft did <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise</a> its fans a year and a half ago that the next console would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever' seen in a hardware generation.</p>



<p>Considering these consoles are still two to three years out, we may have to wait a long time to get the official specs. That said, we'll keep reporting on credible leaks and rumors in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a massive fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a>, especially ones that are designed specifically for head-to-head or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play like 7 Wonders: Duel, Sky Team, and Splendor: Duel. These games tend to play faster than those with larger player counts, but still offer the juicy decision-making I crave. So when I heard about Zenith, a new tug-of-war-style dueling game set in space, I was immediately intrigued. Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes (making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>). It checks all the boxes for me and has quickly become one of my favorite games to pull off the shelf.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="a30e96ef-17d6-47f2-88b0-73b35d89d8d4" id="225510"><div id="225510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zenith Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith manages to pack a lot of components into a relatively small box. Inside, you'll find three separate game boards (Planet, Technology, and Diplomacy), that connect together to create the main play area. The Technology boards are double-sided, allowing you to mix-and-match to create a randomized progression track before each game that players will need to adapt their strategy to match. Each player uses a set of wooden tech markers to track their progress during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of small cardboard pieces to remove from the punchboards before you start, including three different credit denominations which function as the game's primary currency, bonus tokens, and the Leader badge. The rest of the components are made from high-quality recycled materials, including 80% wood, and all feature an etched design. They have a nice weight to them, and also smell great (who doesn't love the smell of fresh wood?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith's other currency, the aptly-named Zenithium, is represented by a set of yellow wooden tokens. Players primarily interact with each other during the game through the Influence disks that are placed on the Planet board. Each disk features a different color and etched design to represent one of the five planets you're vying for control over: Mercury, Venus, Terra, Mars, and Jupiter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in Zenith revolves around its deck of more than 90 unique Agent cards split across the three factions. Each Agent card includes a name and playful character artwork, many of which are subtle nods to famous sci-fi icons like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, Ray Bradbury, and George Lucas, just to name a few. I had a blast trying to figure out the dozens of references sprinkled throughout the deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the relatively short instruction manual, Zenith also includes two player reference cards that outline turn structure, as well as two double-sided aids that explain the myriad effects found on the Agent cards and Tech board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Zenith is a very straightforward game; the first player to take control of the senate wins. This can be achieved in one of three ways: controlling three of the same planet, controlling four unique planets, or controlling any five planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You gain control of a planet when you have enough Influence, indicated by the colored disks on the Planet board. Each planet has a track with nine spaces: four on your side, four on your opponent's side, and one in the middle. Throughout the game, you and your opponent play cards and develop technology to move each of the five Influence disks back and forth across their corresponding tracks as you try to achieve one of the victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, players sit opposite one another with the Planet board in the middle. Three Tech boards are chosen at random (one for each faction) that connect to one side of the Planet board, with the Diplomacy board connecting to the other side. Each of boards has a distinct pattern on the bottom that ensures it's connected to the correct side of the Planet board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players randomly distribute the bonus tokens across the Planet and Tech boards, take 12 credits and one Zenithium, and draw four cards from the deck to make their starting hand. Because the hand sizes are small, you can mulligan any number of cards to give you the best possible start. Once players have finalized their hand, the game is ready to begin.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players take turns performing one of three actions during their turn: recruit an Agent, develop a technology, or become the Leader. To recruit an Agent, you play a card from your hand, paying for its cost in credits and applying the card's effects. Every card in the deck has a unique effect, and there is a <em>lot</em> of iconography to remember, so you'll likely be relying on the effect description aid quite a bit during your first few games. Each Agent card gains you at least one influence on the corresponding planet, which allows you to move the matching Influence disk towards your side of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you recruit Agents, they are placed in a column below the corresponding planet. Each Agent that has been played provides a discount of one credit for future Agents of the same color. This light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> component incentivizes recruiting multiple Agents to the same planet and allows you to play more powerful Agents without disrupting your economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate action you can take during your turn is developing a technology, which is tracked on the Technology board. Each of the three Tech boards represent one of the game's three factions: Humans, Robots, and Animods, which are basically just anthropomorphic animals. Instead of recruiting an Agent (playing the card from your hand to gain influence), you can play the corresponding faction to its Tech track after paying the required cost in Zenithium. However, this resource can also be used to unlock powerful effects on certain cards, so you'll need to manage your reserves wisely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction's Tech track contains five spaces that increase in cost incrementally as you move up, while providing more powerful effects. The first space of each column only costs one Zenithium and has a relatively lackluster effect. But, each time you move up the Tech track, you'll get to perform every action below it when you move up to the next level. This makes the Technology board an important part of your strategy, as it can have game-altering effects as you reach the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, though, investing in the tech track can feel like a loss of momentum as it doesn't immediately help you gain Influence, so you'll need to balance this carefully as part of your strategy. While investing in a single faction's tech track has increasingly powerful rewards, investing in all three factions equally is another viable option as it provides you Influence when every faction reaches the next tier. The Tech board is an important part of the overall game and shouldn't be ignored, or you'll quickly lose ground to your opponent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last action you can choose to perform during your turn is becoming the Leader of a faction. By discarding a specific faction's card, you gain a one-time effect, as well as the Leader badge. Each faction has a different effect that helps improve your economy: Humans provide you with 4 credits, Robots give you one Zenithium, and Animods allow you to mobilize two cards (place two cards from the top of your deck under the corresponding planet without applying their effect).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Leader badge is important because it increases your hand size while holding it (the only way to do so), while also unlocking powerful bonus effects on some cards. This coveted component often makes for a mini tug-of-war game within the greater game as both players try to keep it in their control and reap its benefits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the strategy in Zenith boils down to carefully managing your resources. Between credits, Zenithium, your recruited Agents, and the cards in your hand, it's a delicate balance as you try to gain tempo over your opponent. Low on credits? You won't be able to play any Agents from your hand. Low on Zenithium? You progress on the Tech board is stalled until you manage to get some more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only aspect that you have little control over is the cards in your hand, as you always draw up to your hand size at the end of your turn and can't discard anything in your hand that isn't useful (with the exception of one Agent that allows you to dump your entire hand when played). While uncommon, there are moments where you can effectively brick while digging for a specific color card or faction. Most of the time it's the result of poorly mismanaging your resources, but when it happens it feels bad to watch your opponent gain momentum. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith features a high level of player interaction, but never manages to feel unfair. Many cards feature effects that disrupt your opponent's board state like Transfer, which allows you to move an Agent from your opponent's side of the board to the matching column on your side, or Exile, which lets you discard one of the Agents on your opponent's side. Investing in the various Tech tracks can allow you to take some credits or Zenithium, but they have a finite number of uses. While these effects can be annoying, one aspect about Zenith that I appreciate is that there's absolutely no way to disrupt your opponent's hand or outright drain their economy by playing cards. This creates a level playing field for both players and limits the amount of "bullying" that just feels bad in other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Zenith is designed for two players, there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">4-player</a> version that pits two teams against one another. While the rules are largely the same, teammates control their own hand of Agents that they can't discuss with one another, and can only recruit Agents on the three planets on their half of the board. When obtaining the Leader badge, that player can choose to give two cards to their teammate, but otherwise can't share any resources. It's an interesting twist on the standard game, but Zenith truly shines best at the intended two player count.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Zenith</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbkrE?object_uuid=ba928005-74cc-4887-a40f-c9a611e1b2fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DNR4VHPQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Two-Player Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 5:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Zenith is a strategic space duel for two where players fight over control of five planets by gaining the most influence. Throughout the game, players will play cards from their hand to recruit Agents with powerful effects, develop technology to swing the game in their favor, and appoint themselves Leader of one of three factions as they grapple for victory. It features a high level of strategic yet fair player interaction that challenges both players to carefully manage their resources, or risk losing tempo to their opponent. With meaningful decisions and tense tug-of-war gameplay packed into a brisk 30-minute experience, Zenith has quickly become one of my favorite two-player games to pull off the shelf.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenith-board-game-review-galactic-tug-of-war-for-two]]></content:encoded>

Resident Evil has a new ultimate adversary — Duolingo's dreaded Owl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Japan's official Resident Evil social media account has begun posting pictures of the Duolingo Owl terrorising Leon S. Kennedy in a warped version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-official-account-declares-the-duolingo-bird-its-new-biological-weapon-duolingo-responds-english-or-spanish/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, the Duolingo Owl — or a buff, supersized version of it — can be seen replacing the menacing Mr X in images that have more than a whiff of AI about them. "Our new biological weapon," the official Resident Evil account states, tagging in the official Duolingo Japan account. "Go. Spread language learning to the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up on the brandter, Duolingo Japan then replied with an image of the young Leon S. Kennedy pursued by its mascot, now wearing a Mr X-style hat. "Leon, you haven't done today's lesson, right?" the caption reads. Gulp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil then replied with an image of Leon using Duolingo to learn Spanish — a nod to the events of Resident Evil 4, which is set in rural Spain. The app even shows a lesson being set by one of the game's infected ganados. "Story of my life," reads the post's accompanying text.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concluding this bizarre saga, a final post from Duolingo Japan shows its mascot, again wearing Mr X's hat, reaching out while standing in front of the burning Raccoon City Police Department.  "I'll chase you anywhere until everyone can play Resident Evil in English," the post states. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">レオン、今日のレッスンやってないよね？ <a href="https://t.co/5JnHIiAxDQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/5JnHIiAxDQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/a0oj39YSnV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a0oj39YSnV</a></p>— Duolingo(デュオリンゴ) | 日本公式🇯🇵 (@Duolingo_Japan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Duolingo_Japan/status/1951598859018555415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">みんなが英語でバイオをプレイできるまで、どこでも追いかけるから <a href="https://t.co/ADgpeedEKs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ADgpeedEKs</a> <a href="https://t.co/F0EmFim8X5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/F0EmFim8X5</a></p>— Duolingo(デュオリンゴ) | 日本公式🇯🇵 (@Duolingo_Japan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Duolingo_Japan/status/1951991448598884506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Why this is all happening is not clear — and Duolingo definitely did not exist back in 2004, when the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> took place. But at a time where Resident Evil fans have been asking for an update on Leon, this is not what many had on their bingo cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe this is why Leon is missing from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade, Star-Crossed World, is dropping on August 28, but until now we didn't have very many details about what exactly the big update to Kirby's biggest adventure would entail. But a new trailer today has cleared up a lot of questions around the scope of this sparkly upgrade, including a look at what new enormous objects Kirby can fit in his ridiculous stretchy mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgrade comes with the usual slate of performance improvements for the base game of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and yeah, dang, the original campaign sure looks smooth. But the meat of the upgrade is in the new Star-Crossed World content, which is unlockable once you've finished the first world of Forgotten Land's campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In it, a glittery meteor smashes into the Forgotten Land and transforms familiar levels into Starry Stages, where shimmering star pathways open up new areas and star fragments power up monsters into stronger versions of themselves. There are also new coins to collect, new figurines, and a new boss rush in the Colosseum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But really, it's the level changes that are the most exciting. While some of the shifts seem to be just interesting little branching paths in familiar places, other Starry Stages appear significantly transformed, including one level where waters part and you run around on the ocean floor. These stages also take advantage of three new Mouthful Mode transformations. In one, Kirby eats a spring and is able to bounce extremely high. In another, he eats a big gear and can roll around, including up and down and along walls, opening up a whole new dimension to movement. And in the third, Kirby can eat a big sign and slide down slopes really fast.</p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big takeaway from today's trailer is that Kirby and the Forgotten Land's Switch 2 upgrade seems like it's trying to earn its $20 upgrade price tag (or $80 full price, if you don't already own the Switch 1 version). When it was first announced, there were some concerns about how expensive the update would be relative to what players were getting out of it. But Star-Crossed World seems like a proper, full DLC for Kirby's first-ever 3D adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a well-deserved one, too. If you somehow skipped Forgotten Land first time around, the Switch 2 version seems like a good opportunity to revisit a game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">we gave an 8/10</a>, saying it "successfully warps the series’ classic mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p>DreadXP and developer Cara Cadaver have announced that VILE: Exhumed is being released as a free shareware title, after the game got caught up in Steam’s mass banning of games due to payment processors refusing to allow people to buy certain games. It was banned for “sexual content with depictions of real people,” even though the game does not contain any of this. Instead, the game is about the developer’s own experience stalking and violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="VILE: EXHUMED | VILEISBANNED.COM" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6lOV2KN_Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cara Cadaver said,<em> “This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. This is our response to being censored, and our rejection of the idea that horror can be defined as acceptable or not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As soon as we realized that the game had been banned, the conversation internally with Cara became about what we collectively could do to do right by her and her work. In the face of widespread attempted censorship, it didn’t feel like a time for half-measures and compromise, so we all decided that releasing the game into the wild where it could never be made unavailable by a single platform felt like the best option, and strongest message.”</em> said DreadXP Director, Hunter Bond.</p>

<p>VILE: Exhumed is available to purchase from the website <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">Vile Is Banned,</a> from where users can download the game for free or choose to donate funds. Cara has said that 50% of all profits will be donated to the charity Red Door Family Shelter, which is based in Toronto and helps families, refugees, and women who are getting out of violent situations.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-adds-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-rain-world-and-more.1262763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft announced the Game Pass lineup for August. The highlight of the lineup is undoubtedly Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will be available starting on Thursday, August 7.</p>



<p>The game, released in late 2023, was originally meant to be an expansion to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but Ubisoft later decided to make it a standalone title, albeit one that was not an open world action RPG like most of the latest titles in the franchise. Assassin's Creed Mirage was well-received by critics and fans. As to the former, here's an excerpt of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 8/10 review of the game</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>



<p>There are rumors that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be getting a DLC</a> funded by the Savvy Games Group, but there's no confirmation for the time being. Even if that turns out to be true, you'd have to pay it separately from the Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage, the following games are being added to Microsoft's subscription service this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rain World (already available through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>MechWarrior 5: Clans (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Aliens: Fireteam Elite (available via cloud, console, and PC starting on August 12 for Game Pass Ultimate, PC GP, and GP Standard)</li>



<li>9 Kings (available via Game Preview on PC via August 14 for Game Pass Ultimate and PC GP)</li>
</ul>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980">President Trump</a> was spotted earlier today wandering around on the roof of the White House. It wasn’t immediately clear why. He might have been surveying the nearby grounds for his proposed $200 million ballroom building that would be nearly twice the size of the White House itself. Or maybe the purported leader of the free world, having recently suffered a string of self-inflicted owns, was simply losing it.</p> <p>The latest sign we are deeply cooked as a nation came as the White House press pool berated the 79-year-old <a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-verdict-guilty-hush-money-trial-phoenix-wright-1851510635">convicted felon</a> with important questions ranging from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/donald-trump-mental-fitness">What are you doing up there?</a>” to “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/gaza-american-democracy-test/">Do you approve of Netanyahu taking over all of Gaza?</a>” At some point Trump was asked what he was trying to build. He tried to shout something incomprehensible about nuclear missiles in response. He pointed up at the sky. Welcome to the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>The contradictions continue to heighten. Who among us can turn away?

He has a Twitch streamer’s knack for marrying the faux-improv of manufactured reality TV with genuinely unpredictable WTF moments.

                <p>The makers of an upcoming spaceship co-op title are making a slight change of course: The game formerly known as Jump Ship has been renamed to Jump Space.</p><p>Development studio Keepsake Games announced the name change in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a>, assuring readers that the rebranding does not affect the game's release plans, and adding that a date announcement for its early access launch is coming this month at Gamescom. The title's Steam listing currently displays a release window of Q3 2025.</p><p>The studio, which was formed by veterans from Mojang, Hazelight Studios, and Coffee Stain Studios, stated that the new name is the result of "trademark complications." Keepsake's post does not go into detail about the complications. "Jump ship" is a fairly common idiom, but any company or product sharing the name could be the reason for a trademark dispute.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨IMPORTANT NEWS!🚨<br>We're renaming to Jump Space, due to trademark complications.<br>This does not affect our release plans -<br>In fact, RELEASE DATE REVEAL at Gamescom later this August! <a href="https://t.co/x2iouYlvmV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/x2iouYlvmV</a></p>  — Jump Space - formerly Jump Ship (@KeepsakeGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Keepsake expressed excitement for the name change. "We think Jump Space is super cool, after all, there is more to the game than just the Ship," the Steam post continues. Funnily enough, this isn't the first name change for the game, as it previously<a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1663878368696193031" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> went by the codename Hyperspace</a> before a formal reveal as Jump Ship in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-looks-like-ftl-combined-with-sea-of-thieves/1100-6522368/" data-ref-id="1100-6522368">Jump Space has four players</a> act as crew members on a spacefaring craft, taking on several "hand crafted missions with random elements." Players will switch between operating and maintaining the ship, space walking, and exploring planets on foot.</p><p>Common points of comparison to Jump Space include Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, and it joins the budding "space Sea of Thieves-like" subgenre alongside Void Crew and Wildgate. However, Jump Space is purely a PvE experience, bringing it closer to Void Crew and less like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-space-pvp-game-wildgate-will-be-supported-after-launch/1100-6533150/" data-ref-id="1100-6533150">PvP-focused Wildgate</a>.</p><p>According to Keepsake Games, over 1 million people have added Jump Space to their Steam wishlist. The game is running a closed beta, and a free demo was available for a limited time this past June as a part of Steam Next Fest. Keepsake says that the Next Fest demo reached over 500,000 players.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo.1262745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
RTA, Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event, has confirmed there'll be no Nintendo games present at this year's show due to Nintendo's strict rules around the use of its products.
</p>
<p>
This year's RTA in Japan marathon runs from 9th-15th August, and promises dozen of speedruns throughout the week, with all proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders. Its <a href="https://horaro.org/rtaij/rtaijs2025">lengthy 2025 schedule</a> includes everything from Minecraft and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cuphead">Cuphead</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, but organisers confirmed several months ago that Nintendo games would not be included at this year's event - and they've now explained why.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">statement shared on the RTA website</a> (as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">translated by Automaton</a>), organisers say they were contacted by Nintendo on 13th June and told that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" to feature the company's games. Not only that, RTA was informed their previous streams constituted "unauthorised use". It seems Nintendo expects RTA to apply for permission to feature its titles on a game-by-game basis, but the complexity of the task meant it wasn't practical to do so in time for this year's show.
</p>
<p>
However, organisers have expressed hope of including Nintendo titles in future speedrunning events and are currently negotiating with the company.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has, of course, long sought to control third-parties' ability to utilise its games, particularly where streaming is concerned. While some might see YouTube fan videos and similar community content as an opportunity for free promotion, Nintendo has historically deemed such activities as copyright infringement, even going as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-claiming-ad-revenue-for-youtube-lets-play-videos">demand all ad revenue</a> for streaming at one time. And while the company's stance has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-scraps-creators-program-making-life-much-easier-for-youtubers">softened somewhat over the years</a>, stories sporadically emerge highlighting its strict - if not <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youtubes-updated-violence-and-profanity-restrictions-can-retroactively-restrict-gaming-videos">outright draconian</a> - rules where third-parties usage is concerned.
</p>
<p>
Memorably, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-addresses-controversial-smash-world-tour-fan-competition-closure-in-lengthy-statement">accused of trying to halt the Smash World Tour Championship in 2022</a> after it refused to grant a license to competition organisers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced an Indie World Nintendo Direct stream will be taking place on Thursday, 7th August.</p>
<p>The stream will kick off at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 9AM EDT / 6AM PDT) and will run for a tight 15 minutes with a blend of announcements and updates on games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTv0HmKoUqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It follows on from the partner showcase last week, which was stuffed with a whole host of announcements like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-with-its-first-action-packed-trailer/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-a-hd-2d-prequel-coming-to-switch-switch-2-this-year/">Octopatch Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot</a>. In hindsight, there were next to no indie games included in that stream, leaving some big open goals for this Indie World stream to shoot for.</p>
<p>There’s a number of key indie titles that are expected for Switch that could make an appearance here, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-2">Hades 2</a> which is set to be a console exclusive, or the very, very highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if everyone’s wishes are fulfilled!</p>
