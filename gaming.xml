That’s exactly what’s happening now with this weekend deal discounting the <em>Final Fantasy 1-6 Pixel Remaster</em> bundle to $59.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-i-vi-remastered-bundle">Humble</a> (PC), the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-i-vi-bundle-switch%2F">Nintendo eShop</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA33837_00-FFBUNDLEPS4ENA06">PlayStation</a>.

            <p>Sometimes I want to play a video game, and sometimes I just want to assemble a quiet little Dutch town with iron bridges, fountains and dinky trams bustling about like bumble bees. The project in question is <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/tramstertram">Tramstertram</a>. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it's a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">really rather lovely Viewfinder</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Released a few hours ago, Tramstertram gives you a rotatable 3D scene with a choice of tiles to plonk down - townhouses, streets, tram rails, and parkland, all of which coalesce into larger structures when you slot them together. It's a homage to Townscaper, but not nearly as elaborate, just a small gift left on a digital windowsill for any passerby who, for whatever reason, might need to lose a few minutes enjoying the sight of a tramcar sparking and trundling along a row of trees.</p>
<p>Tramstertram comes with a small selection of prefabricated towns, including a fourth map that gives away the alchemy behind the tile combinations, and the ability to copy-and-paste a world code to share your creation. If you're not so keen on trams, Stark has extensive prior for this kind of thing. He's made similar building toys involving <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/treehouse-canvas">treehouses</a>, <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/fish-tank-greenhouse">fishtanks</a>, and <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/coal-toy">mining carts</a>.</p>
<p>Nice note to end the week on, I think? If you need a bit more meat on these bones, keep an eye out for the "whimsigoth" cottage builder Tiny Glade, due for release this year - Kiera <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">loved it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London was released just two weeks ago and is the biggest mod to be created for Fallout 4, which completely transforms the game into a new world for players to explore, with new quests and voice actors. Since its release, Fallout: London has become the fastest-redeemed game on GOG, aided by the 60% off sale on GOG's Fallout 4: Game of the Year edition. Team FOLON have announced that there is now a brand-new update for Fallout: London that will fix a lot of the bugs and issues players have been experiencing.</p>
<p>The initial release of Fallout: London was highly successful, and patches were quickly released to address any bugs and crashes that players were experiencing. Team FOLON worked extremely hard on this project and continues to work on it by providing new updates to the game.</p>
<p>In the first 24 hours alone, the Fallout 4 mod was redeemed over 500,000 times, making it the fastest-redeemed game on GOG in its history.</p>
<p>While the mod did incredibly well on release, there were quite a few teething issues with the Steam version of the game, especially because Steam had the Next-Gen update, which players would have to figure out how to roll back to use the Fallout: London mod.</p>
<p>For those who have been dealing with difficulties, Team FOLON has personally taken the time to help players who have been dealing with issues while trying to set up the mod on their official Discord server. They also utilize the server to get feedback on how the mod is performing in the players' eyes.</p>
<p>With all the feedback and troubleshooting done so far, Team FOLON is releasing a<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-folon-working-on-major-bug-fixes/"> new update</a> for Fallout: London, which brings many fixes to the mod. This includes fixes to broken quest lines, such as "Broken Angel" and "Heavenslayer."</p>
<p>In addition to fixing the broken quest lines, they tweaked certain perks, such as "Lab Rat" and "Railway Spine," making them more severe than they were previously. There are also some huge changes to the game's weaponry and a decrease in Rads in the River Thames from 250 to 169.</p>
<p>Previously, some voice lines for some of the characters were missing, and they have now changed that, added in the missing voice lines for Beefy and Smythe, and fixed ambient audio.</p>
<p>For those&nbsp;<span>who have been stuck in Fallout: London, GOG has released a post with instructions on<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WymJLLvM4hHQZxUdLQriu6YagIlJyiR4YlrQfEk6_k/edit#heading=h.ql8e1asm5i1j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;how to update to</a> the most updated version, which should significantly decrease</span> bugs. The instructions may seem slightly complicated, involving going into the Fallout 4 data folder and deleting specific files. However, it will be worth the effort once it's done.</p>

Besides rocking a bunch of nasty growths on their carapaces, <strong>Spore Chargers also emanate an acid-green fog that fills their immediate surroundings and obscures their exact location</strong>.</p><p>The first time I bumped into one of these things, I didn’t even realize it. Thanks to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s various weather effects, I thought I was simply caught in one of the planet’s acid storms, which I knew <em>could</em> happen before diving into my mission. Before I knew it, I was running to an objective and could hardly see a few feet in either direction when a teammate called out that they’d spotted a Spore Charger among the dense fog.</p><p>Reader, I yelped when the thing finally popped out of nowhere. But thanks to that experience, I can now inform y’all on how best to proceed when running into a Spore Charger.</p><h2 id="h1183"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find a Spore Charger</strong></h2><p>Much like the new Impaler, as well as most of the advanced variants of enemies, <strong>Spore Chargers are more easily spotted on higher difficulties. I first spotted one around a level 7 mission, and they likely begin to show up around level 6, which is dubbed “Extreme” in the game.</strong> This is around the time where the modifiers start suggesting massive enemies as well as heavily armored ones, and I do think these bad boys fit the bill.<br></p><p>As I already mentioned, they are pretty apparent from their appearance, but the telltale sign that you are about to face off with a Spore Charger is the fog that’ll quickly swallow you up. The fog moves <em>with </em>the Charger so they’ll always be at the heart of it, even if it’s difficult to tell up from down while you’re in there. That’s why we’re going to need abilities and weapons that lock on and pack a lot of strength in order to take them out easily.<br></p><h2 id="h1184"><a id=""></a><strong>How to kill a Spore Charger</strong></h2><p>Now because these things are so heavily armored, you’re going to want to pack something with explosive power. <strong>As far as weapon stratagems, bring an Expendable Anti-Tank rocket launcher, Commando, or a Spear if you think you’re going to have to deal with a Spore Charger. </strong>Much like with a normal Charger, blowing the protective shell off its face and then following up with a second shot should do the trick quite easily.</p><p>Personally, I might prefer a Spear due to the lock-on function. Given the nature of the Spore Charger’s passive fog, as well as the fact that it appears on difficulties where you’re often being swarmed, it’s good insurance to have a weapon that makes up for any human error. Just remember to give it some space, since the Spear has to first launch the rocket up into the air before it locks on and comes back down on it.<br></p><p>If you don’t want to have to deal with a Spore Charger head-on, there are actually a number of ways to get around that which put some of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s underused stratagems to use. <strong>Both the Orbital Railcannon Strike and the Eagle 110MM Rocket Pods are going to be key to taking out Spore Chargers from a relatively safe distance. That’s because both stratagems will automatically lock on to the largest target in the area, rather than simply hitting the area marked by your beacon.</strong><br></p><p>These stratagems have always been helpful for enemy units that are constantly on the move, like Bile Titans and standard Chargers, but thanks to the Spore Charger’s ability to impair your vision, they are now handier than ever.<br></p><p>If you’re feeling particularly gung-ho and want to avoid using any stratagems—or simply run out because of how grueling your mission is—<strong>Spore Chargers do actually have more gaps in their armor than most other Chargers. Their sides are practically exposed thanks to the immense acidic growths, and the underside of their rear sports the same weak spot as every other Charger,</strong> but this approach will consume both ammo and time, which are a hot commodity in <em>Helldivers 2</em>.<em> </em><strong>Also be wary of killing them while you’re too close, as they do explode and spread their acid all over the place as they do.</strong> You’re much better off using any number of the above stratagems to quickly take out a Charger before it becomes a problem.<br></p><p>Now, I believe you’re ready to take on the bug front of the Second Galactic War and thank goodness for that. We need well-informed boots on the ground out there to bring the fight to those nasty bastards and really stick it to them. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The views around Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon don’t appear to be all that good.

And is response, as you could have expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the past two weeks</a>, wasn’t all that positive.</p>

<p>“People who I’ve talked to are a little pessimistic about it even hitting it’s current planned deadline, but we’ll see.”</p>



<p>Schreier added that he doesn’t know exactly when the current deadline for the game is, but it’s believed to be sometime in 2025.</p>







<p>“I mean, the sentiment I’ve heard is not great around it at least as of a few months ago,” he said.</p>



<p>The development of the Marathon reboot has been shaky, at best, over the past couple of years. The game had a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific gameplay loop</a> that included customizable characters only to change to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having a cast of “heroes”</a> to choose from instead. On top of that, Christopher Barrett, who was Marathon’s game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was replaced earlier this year</a> by former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler. The game even lost its executive producer not long ago, as well.</p>

Police officers investigating the scene later discovered a strange substance on Osmanova’s table, which was subsequently analysed and confirmed to be a form of mercury.</p><p>Exposure to mercury can be extremely hazardous and is capable of triggering a range of serious health problems affecting the lungs, eyes, and the digestive and immune systems. During a subsequent investigation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1s1Q3knZA&amp;t=36s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security footage emerged online</a> showing Osmanova’s opponent and rival in the competition Amina Abakarova allegedly spread a substance over the table.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian chess champion Amina Abakarova was caught on CCTV trying to poison her rival <a href="https://t.co/I23Wpar0nb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/I23Wpar0nb</a></p>— non aesthetic things (@PicturesFoIder) <a href="https://twitter.com/PicturesFoIder/status/1821669643330678986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The Republic of Dagestan's minister of sports Sazhid Sazhidov assured fans via a Russian-language Telegram post that Osmanova is not in a life threatening condition, while the Russian Chess Federation noted that “no one else was hurt” as a result of the poisoning attempt. However, Russian outlets have since reported that another woman and a competition organizer also become unwell following the alleged attack.</p><p>Russian media site <a href="https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTVI</a> reports Osmanova had known Abakarova since childhood, and that the two had grown to become rivals before falling out during a recent competition, in which the latter brought a phone to a competition, in violation of the event’s rules.</p><p>“Like many others, I am perplexed by what happened, and the motives of such an experienced athlete as Amina Abakarova are also unclear to me,” wrote Sazhidov in the <a href="https://t.me/minsportrd/13492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram post</a>, translated to English via machine translation. “The actions she took could have led to the most tragic outcome, they threatened the lives of everyone in the chess house, including herself.

In Spring you have limited options for crops compared to summer and fall, partially because one of the best crops isn't sold at Pierre's Store.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-to-%E2%80%9Ccontinuously-release-hit-titles-%E2%80%9D-says-sony.949488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-to-continuously-release-hit-titles-says-sony/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has declared that PlayStation Studios plans to "consistently and continuously" release hit games. Sony Interactive Entertainment strives to refine its development process and release schedules to ensure this is true.</p>
<p>This is surprising, considering PlayStation Studios has recently admitted to struggling to maintain sustainable profit margins despite its highly successful games. These games include the PC port of Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, but that hasn't been enough to stop layoffs at PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>Over 900 roles were cut from PlayStation Studios during this process, with a new management structure created under joint CEOs Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino.</p>
<p>Sony announced its earnings in its first-quarter financial reports for FY2024 two days ago. In an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20240807/sA7GHnQS/202503_1q_02_en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings call</a>, Sony discussed its willingness to strengthen its development schedule: "The Studio Business Group is strengthening its development schedule management and optimizing development projects to consistently and continuously release hit titles."</p>
<p>In addition to this, they are also working on "maintaining and expanding" the number of active PlayStation users while strengthening user engagement. By doing this, the aim is to "establish a stable earnings base," which is one of the number one priorities for PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 has sold 61.7 million units worldwide, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-61-7-million-units/">the console sales</a> are slowing down rapidly, faster than Sony was originally expecting. While it did make a profit in Q3 of FY2023 at $10.2 billion, its Operating Profits fell by 25.9% year-on-year.</p>
<p>In terms of game releases, it has been a relatively quiet year for PlayStation overall, as they haven't released any blockbuster-type games this year. Despite this, they have announced several console exclusives. These games include Concord, Astro Bot, and Lego Horizon Adventures.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of PlayStation Plus members has dropped, predominantly due to players' dissatisfaction with the selection of games they are given. While it is the beginning of August, PlayStation still has plenty of time to announce more upcoming blockbuster games. Still, we will have to wait and see whether they will do that or continue to focus on porting PlayStation exclusives over to PC, the most recent being Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Compared to other State of Plays, there was a lot of discourse around the latest State of Play, as people felt it was a bit lackluster compared to other showcases in the past. We can only hope the new schedule and developments they are planning don't lead to more layoffs.</p>

		<p>Ooooh, it’s the big spooky edition of What We Played, the one possessed by the Devil’s number. So, in the finest traditions of this feature, I asked everyone to not only tell me their gaming habits of the week gone by, but to also tell me their favourite thing about the Devil and/or the occult.</p>
<p>For me? Well, I kind of just think that pentagrams look neat and are fun to draw. It’s a bit like the ‘Cool S’, but more witchy and goth. Also, I think The Good Place could probably count here. I need to rewatch that show sometime!</p>
<p>My gaming this week has been anything but devilish… unless you think pirate cats are the work of the dark one. I wrapped up our review of the cute and fun action RPG action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/">Cat Quest 3</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> favourite thing about the occult is a bit of silly wordplay, as he says “Dungeons and Dragons is a cult but is also good.” He should know, because he’s a fully fledged member, having played D&amp;D three times in the past week an had “a blast every time”. He’s also played an awful lot of Dome Keeper.</p>

<p>It’s “everything” occult for <strong>Nic</strong>, with the one caveat that the cult of Taylor Swift is “too intense” for him. And so he’s been burrowing back into MTG Arena, shifting back into the digital game after a spell – geddit? – of only playing paper. He has thoughts on the new Bloomburrow expansion, which “is phenomenally cute, but it turns out underpowered relative to what we’ve had recently. Its effect on the meta has been somewhat less than I had hoped!”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> reckons that “demons have all the best tunes, but no full quantitative study has yet to be carried out regarding video games.” He’s been playing a decidedly un-fiendish mixture of games, including Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Dungeons of hinterberg, rattling through boomer shooter Bloodhound and the original Breath of Fire, and finally made a start on Spider-Man 2, since it was taking up SSD space on his PS5.</p>
<p>There was a little tickle of Destiny 2 for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, of course, but he also finished off RoboCop: Rogue City, “and it was exactly what a RoboCop game should be, including rescuing cats. It’s not a perfect game, but it’s the perfect RoboCop game.” Meanwhile, his favourite devil-y thing is Lucifer the TV series: “One of the best TV police procedurals every created but with added demons and angels. Also Exploding Kitterns on Netflix which has lots of demons but also God is voiced by Tom Ellis. aka Lucifer from Lucifer.&nbsp; So he’s played both sides, ahem.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> favourite cult is the one from Hot Fuzz, but has he taken that “greater good” ethos across to his week of gaming? Not really. He played Red Dead Redemption 2, “which continues to try and make me not love it”, and then set foot into Mount and Blade Bannerlord, albeit with cheats on just so he could survive.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> crammed in as much gaming as possible this week with a twosome of continuing his Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough with a stealthy Netrunner, and reinstalling For Honor to get his fix of hero battlers while waiting for Concord to release later this month.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with <strong>Miguel</strong> who’s been playing one of those 90s games that would’ve had your gran clutching her pearls for fear that your computer was actually filled with the Dark Lord’s minions – “I’m playing the new co-op Doom 1+2 re-release because I LOVE (killing) DEMONS AAAA 666!!!!!”</p>
<p><em>And with that, what have you played this week? Feel free to share your own devilish delights.</em></p>

Intel is working with its partners to ensure timely validation and rollout of the BIOS update for systems currently in service.</p><p><strong>Instability Analysis Update – Microcode Background and Performance Implications</strong></p><p>In addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">extended warranty coverage</a>, Intel has released three mitigations related to the instability issue – commonly experienced as consistent application crashes and repeated hangs – to help stabilize customer systems with Intel Core 13th and 14th gen desktop processors:</p><p>1. Intel default settings to avoid elevated power delivery impact to the processor (May 2024)</p><p>2. Microcode 0x125 to fix the eTVB issue in i9 processors (June 2024)</p><p>3. Microcode 0x129 to address elevated voltages (August 2024)</p><p>Intel’s current analysis finds there is a significant increase to the minimum operating voltage (Vmin) across multiple cores on affected processors due to elevated voltages. Elevated voltage events can accumulate over time and contribute to the increase in Vmin for the processor.</p><p>The latest microcode update (0x129) will limit voltage requests above 1.55V as a preventative mitigation for processors not experiencing instability symptoms. This latest microcode update will primarily improve operating conditions for K/KF/KS processors. Intel is also confirming, based on extensive validation, all future products will not be affected by this issue.</p><p>Intel is continuing to investigate mitigations for scenarios that can result in Vmin shift on potentially impacted&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors</a>. Intel will provide updates by end of August.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel’s internal testing – utilizing Intel Default Settings - indicates performance impact is within run-to-run variation (eg. 3DMark: Timespy, WebXPRT 4, Cinebench R24, Blender 4.2.0) with a few sub-tests showing moderate impacts (WebXPRT Online Homework; PugetBench GPU Effects Score). For gaming workloads tested, performance has also been within run-to-run variation (eg. Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Warhammer III – Mirrors of Madness) with one exception showing slightly more impact (Hitman 3: Dartmoor). However, system performance is dependent on configuration and several other factors.</p><p>For unlocked Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, this latest microcode update (0x129) will&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>prevent users from overclocking if they so choose.

            <p>The weekend bears down on us like a host of hissing, barrel-throwing psychics, but there is yet time for some brief updates on Remedy's Control 2, which Remedy say is coming along nicely. The same is apparently true of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-second-very-tiny-look-at-remedys-co-op-control-spin-off">the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor</a> and the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.</p><!--more-->
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/max-payne-1-2-remakes-are-in-full-production-control-2-is-now-in-a-playable-state/">VGC</a>, Remedy reveal in their latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">financial report</a> that Control 2 has "progressed to the production readiness stage", following the delivery of "a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form". They're now "scaling up" for full production. Teaser trailer with target visuals anytime, Remedy. I have yet to hear a telekinesis sound effect as gratifying as the one in Control. </p>
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, meanwhile, has "progressed from production readiness to the full production stage". According to Remedy, the development team is currently working towards a version of the game that is playable from beginning to end. As for Condor - in which you seemingly join a scrappy group of federal agents, marooned within the Oldest House - "the development team has worked on multiple maps and different mission types, and we have organized a growing amount of internal and limited external playtesting for feature validation and feedback."</p>
<p>In February this year, Remedy acquired the rights to the Control franchise from 505 Games, giving them sovereign say over how and when Control games get published. Remedy also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-and-tencents-co-op-multiplayer-game-kestrel-has-been-cancelled">cancelled a Tencent collaboration codenamed Kestrel in May</a>, freeing up resources and people for their existing franchises.</p>
<p>Since then, the latest financial release explains, they've been "weighing self-publishing and related business models, as well as discussing different partner publishing opportunities" for both Control and the Alan Wake series. We can apparently expect to hear more "towards the end of the year". Here's my pitch for the future of Control: make a spin-off series based on CTRL+ keyboard shortcuts. CTRL+F could be a detective simulation, for example, while CTRL+O could be an open worlder, and CTRL-Alt-Delete is a special minigame I play with Alan Wake 2 as and when the raytracing gives my PC a seizure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>, the mega-powered hack-and-slash action platformer that will kill you, <em>a lot</em>, offering you the tremendous satisfaction of mastery as you eventually learn its perils and emerge victorious. And there’s <em>Abathor</em>, a somewhat less grueling (though by no means easy) barbarian side-scroller in which up to four players can tackle an epic journey across its dozens of increasingly wild and inventive stages. While both games are calling to me, I suspect that this weekend it will be the more immediately approachable <em>Abathor </em>I gravitate to first.<br></p><p>I was introduced to <em>Abathor </em>by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2217277843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2217277843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitch stream</a></span> from the always-entertaining Macaw45, a barbarian game connoisseur who, early on in the game, expressed mild disappointment with how plain its stages were. However, as the epic journey went on and on (and on), that disappointment gradually shifted to enthusiasm and awe as <em>Abathor </em>became more epic and crazed. In the days since, he has repeatedly gushed about how incredible the game finally becomes. I actually stopped watching his <em>Abathor </em>stream before he got too far, having decided that I wanted to experience its surprises for myself. This weekend, I intend to do that, at least when I’m not visiting the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://liretro.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://liretro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Island Retro Gaming Expo</a></span> here in New York City. One thing’s for sure, it’s going to be an intensely retro-gaming-influenced weekend for yours truly, and I am stoked. —<strong>Carolyn Petit</strong> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-recommend-id="image://f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-recommend-id="image://f2f36bc4632d9110383420b7b2770033" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ship combat in Cat Quest III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox X/S, Xbox One, Windows<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Make this fantasy a reality</p><p>Look, I’ll be honest with you. So many of these entries I write are more wish than fact. They’re the games I <em>wish</em> I were going to be playing this weekend. And were life more generous, I totally would be! Sometimes I even do. But also, I have a child, and it needs to be taken to its swimming lesson at 9.15 a.m. Saturday, and then to its tennis club at 11, and then demands to be entertained in some manner throughout the afternoon, and by the time I’ve cooked dinner (chicken curry this Saturday) and got the smaller human to bed, the adult human demands I sit with her and watch shit on the TV. Then much the same for Sunday.</p><p>So, if a magic time fairy magically gives me an expanse of child-free time this weekend, I would really like to play <em>Cat Quest III</em>. Admittedly I’ve yet to get very far with <em>Cat Quest II</em>, having completed the first game last year, but still, it looks lovely. I want to be playing that. —<strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-recommend-id="image://1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Balloon arch!

I’ve unfortunately neglected the game for a few weeks, as I’ve gotten pulled around by other responsibilities.

I’ve restarted it a few times across a few different platforms and I just <em>can’t</em> stick with it.

Now I’m looking forward to going back and seeing if I can master some of the earlier missions I shit the bed on and see if I can complete them on the hardest difficulty. —<strong>Ethan Gach</strong> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca70e567841302d636143675e2edf8c8" data-recommend-id="image://ca70e567841302d636143675e2edf8c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The sparkly dancy action of Kunitsu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The sparkly dancy action of Kunitsu" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca70e567841302d636143675e2edf8c8" data-recommend-id="image://ca70e567841302d636143675e2edf8c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The sparkly dancy action of Kunitsu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows, PS5, PS4<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Collect some more demon masks</p><p>Up until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358">Ethan’s recent review of this new Capcom action-strategy game</a></span>, I had no idea this thing existed. I’m not sure I’d have downloaded and played it, but after reading his review and other people’s thoughts on the game, I was curious. The pitch that it’s a PS2-like action-strategy game with simple base building and fun <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-like combat intrigued me.<br></p><p>Since starting the game, I’ve been hooked. It’s not the best-looking game ever made, nor is it the most advanced thing I’ve ever played, but it does remind me of the random PS2 games I’d play back in the day. Back when I’d stroll through my local Blockbuster, looking for something new while my parents picked out a movie. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is the kind of game I’d see a few times over the course of a month or two, but never pick it up. Finally, I’d give it a shot probably because the games I wanted that week were already rented. And it was these random games that would sometimes blow me away. I can imagine a much younger Zack falling in love with this weird game about protecting a goddess and saving villages on a mountain. He’d get a kick out of it, even if he could barely pronounce most of the enemy names in it. —<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This roll isn't too bad, as you're getting a nice spread of recovery, strength, and discipline, although resilience will need to be enhanced with an armor mod. A pretty decent Exotic to pick up this week if you're planning to do some PvP activities specifically.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 65</li></ul><h3>Raiju's Harness (Exotic Hunter chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4348047-destiny22024-08-0919-05-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348047" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4348047-destiny22024-08-0919-05-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348047"></a><figcaption>Raiju's Harness</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4348047-destiny22024-08-0919-05-24.jpg"></figure><p>One of the best Exotic pieces for Hunters who enjoy using their Arc Staff Super, Raiju's Harness boosts Arc weapon damage, consumes less energy when not attacking, and can create a blinding explosion when the Super is deactivated early.

Pair it with an Ergo Sum sword that has the Riskrunner perk, and you'll melt through enemies very easily. This is a fairly balanced roll of the Exotic, with intellect being the only disappointment here.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone/" data-ref-id="5000-612203">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> is an odd name for a horror game. It almost implies we ought to know who Frank Stone is, or why his "casting" (whatever that means in this context) is notable. But after playing the game's prologue, I still feel out of the loop. Supermassive, famous for cinematic horror games such as Until Dawn, The Quarry, and The Dark Pictures Anthology, has been handed the reins to Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight (DBD) franchise for a cinematic spin-off that plays much like its other popular games.</p><p dir="ltr">That's an exciting prospect in itself. Supermassive's playable horror movies routinely make for terrific party games. But my prevailing impression after an hour with the game is that DBD fans will get more out of this than those who come in without knowing the PvP horror game well, but also that such an arrangement actually seems okay for both groups.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Casting Of Frank Stone | Official Story Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It would be self-defeating to make a horror game intended for general fans but write its story in such a way that it's impenetrable to anyone but fans of its source material. I don't feel that's what is going on in the case of Frank Stone. However, the demo I played contains a handful of moments where I couldn't tell if what was happening was mysterious to <em>everyone</em> who may play, or just those who haven't jumped into DBD.</p><p dir="ltr">I've not spent enough time with it to consider myself an expert, but I happen to enjoy DBD. My dabbling with the game also means I'm not very caught up on the lore. It speaks of an Entity that inhabits the bodies of various killers over many years, and this story conceit is also why DBD enjoys the unique position of being Spooky Fortnite, as I call it, with a plethora of horror icons like Ghostface and the Xenomorph supplementing a roster that features a ton of original monstrosities, none of whom, however, are Frank Stone.</p><p dir="ltr">One popular theory in the DBD community is that Frank Stone is the first person to become possessed by this Entity, and so in playing The Casting of Frank Stone, Dead By Daylight fans will get to witness a prequel to all they've seen in Behaviour's mainline game. But if you're among the uninitiated, I don't think there's any reason to worry. For you, like the demo was for me, The Casting of Frank Stone may just be an intriguing supernatural horror story--no strings attached, and no homework required.</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring the demo, I did see at least one definitive DBD Easter egg in the form of a doll resembling one of the game's killers, but if anything else was directly tied to the game, it went over my head--or was perhaps shrouded in darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">But the story beats, as best I can tell, don't <em>require </em>any additional reading. The demo takes place decades ago in the fictional Cedar Hills, Oregon, and casts players as a young cop investigating the disappearance of a little boy. That brings him to a steel mill and in the presence of a strange old man and his dog, who guard the place overnight. As the officer explores the mill, players will solve minor environmental puzzles and choose dialogue options, which in turn shape his relationship with the caretaker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348042"></a><figcaption>Meet Frank Stone, whose violent backstory will drive the game forward for DBD fans and newcomers alike.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg"></figure><p>Players will also find lore items that expand on the story and perform frequent quicktime events (QTEs), which have been given a clever audiovisual makeover to look just like DBD's skill checks. As mentioned, the demo serves as a prologue, and so these characters won't be the ones players control in the bulk of the full game, but it allows for a kind of tutorial while also setting up the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Failing QTEs early on in Supermassive games can result in minor penalties, like a character tripping over themselves. But as the game goes on, failing these button presses, or making the wrong decision in the game's twisting, choose-your-own-adventure narrative can often result in playable characters being killed off permanently. From a gameplay standpoint, Frank Stone is as familiar to Supermassive's returning players as it is simple enough to learn if you are new to the developer's catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of my time with the demo saw me fend off an attack from a killer, presumably our titular villain, before a gruesome death occurred. As the camera panned back slowly, either unveiling some clue that was lost to me or just being generally cinematic in the way Supermassive often is--I can't say for sure--I found myself wondering if I would recognize the setting if I were a bigger DBD fan, but I also felt like it didn't ultimately matter. Surely even DBD obsessives aren't intended to understand the game's story after one chapter, so if this dramatic shot meant a bit more to them than it did to me, I'm cool with that.</p><p dir="ltr">For me, Frank Stone may be the latest spooky romp through an interactive movie in which all of the playable characters can die (or live) by the end of the game, depending on my decisions. That's a formula that I love returning to every time, even as the end results surely vary. For bigger Dead By Daylight fans, there's certainly an additional layer to enjoy, perhaps creating new DBD fans too--which is the point, of course. But what both groups have in common is its central mystery: Who is Frank Stone and, furthermore, why is he homicidal?</p><p dir="ltr">These disparate groups of players may have different motives, but they're largely asking the same questions, and if the game can satisfyingly answer those questions, Supermassive will have its next hit on its hands, while Behaviour may have a new path to expanding its already-impressive horror universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Casting of Frank Stone launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and at $40 (or $50 for the Deluxe Edition), may be cheaper than you're expecting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-boyfriend-shines-in-the-shadow-of-terrace-house.949410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/boyfriend-netflix-terrace-house-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been four years since the cancellation of <em>Terrace House</em>, a Japanese reality show that felt like the realest thing on TV until...<a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191024/p2a/00m/0na/015000c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it turned out it was anything but</a>. Between the reckoning over those revelations and the absence of the program itself, it's been a long, cold four years for fans of the series.</p><p>I'm one of those fans, and I'll be honest with you up top here:<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21273888/terrace-house-death-hana-kimura-what-happened-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> despite everything we learned in the wake of the show's cancellation, from the manipulation of the "plot" to the conditions its stars were forced to live under--which culminated in <em>the death of a participant</em>, Hana Kimura</a>--a part of me (a very small, selfish part) still missed the show and wanted it back. I didn't want it to come back in the same broken ways of course, changes would have to be made, but I loved the core premise of <em>Terrace House</em> so much that I figured it was only a matter of time until it found a way to retool itself and return to the airwaves.</p><p>As the years went by, though, and it became clear <em>Terrace House's</em> multiple failures and their tragic consequences had made the brand radioactive, regardless of anything it ever did <em>right</em>, I think most fans--myself included--had made peace with the fact the show had existed, run its course, fucked things up and was now part of TV history. Until, out of nowhere, along came <em>The Boyfriend</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Boyfriend | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VS2gv--0Pug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This show's marketing has been <em>very </em>careful with how it pitches the program. It has rightly been hailed as a triumph of inclusivity in its native Japan, as it's the first <em>ever </em>gay dating show to air in the country, and the way it's able to depict same-sex relationships as something totally normal and not some exotic spectacle is a triumph of both its setup and its production. <em>The Boyfriend </em>has been sold as a pioneering dating show, which in one way is exactly what it is, and <a href="https://macaonews.org/news/around-the-world/japan-the-boyfriend-netflix-lgbtq-same-sex-dating-show/#:~:text=Japan's%20first%20same%2Dsex%20dating%20show%20is%20winning%20over%20international%20viewers&amp;text=Japan's%20first%2Dever%20same%2Dsex,on%20a%20well%2Dworn%20format." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been a huge success as a result</a>.</p><p>But let's be real: as you could probably tell just by watching the trailer above, <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/movies-tv/the-boyfriend-premieres-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is <em>Terrace House </em>rebranded</a>. This is the successor show fans have been waiting years for. Just like <em>Terrace House</em>, <em>The Boyfriend </em>is about a group of singles tossed into a fancy AirBnB, where they have to juggle work and play, form friendships, find love and be on camera the whole time they're doing it. The events are even narrated by a studio panel, which--in case you were still on the fence after everything I just described--includes <em>Terrace House</em> veteran Yoshimi Tokui.</p><p>Yet for all its similarities, <em>The Boyfriend</em> also has some key differences that were surely implemented to avoid the show repeating <em>Terrace House's</em> mistakes. Its stars were only thrown into a house for a month, not <em>months</em>. There were less people in the house, everybody was given their own private bedroom, drinking appeared to be far less common and most plotlines seemed to be driven out in the open instead of behind the scenes, since stars were repeatedly sent out on work assignments (basically day-long dates) together, and were filmed the entire time.</p><p>These changes had an effect on what we saw and enjoyed as voyeurs, of course. Everything in <em>The Boyfriend </em>feels tamer and more reserved than <em>Terrace House</em>; the show lacks any real scandal, its smaller cast means there are fewer plotlines to follow and its brevity means there's only a limited rotation of participants. The whole show feels like a shareware version of <em>Terrace House</em>, a replica scale model, ostensibly the same thing, but also greatly reduced.</p><figure><figcaption>I will not spoil it, but these chicken breasts were the highlight of the show for me</figcaption></figure><p>And that's great? Because let's get a grip, for everything fans loved about <em>Terrace House</em>, a lot of that drama came from a very fucked up place, and it led to some very real and tragic consequences. If what people enjoyed about <em>Terrace House</em> was how real it felt, how chill and relatable everyone's interactions appeared to be compared to the bombast and psycho-competitiveness of Western reality shows, then surely you'll enjoy it even more if those interactions are...more real?</p><p>I'm not saying this show has improved the <em>Terrace House</em> formula in a way that can shield it from future controversy, nor can I be some kind of guarantor that every single thing you see in the series is free from the manipulation of producers and camera operators. This is, after all, a reality TV show designed for entertainment, not a documentary. But huge stretches of <em>The</em> <em>Boyfriend </em>take place in a kind of haze, where everyone just hangs out and not much happens, relationships spark then fizzle, and while this initially feels like a disappointment as a <em>viewer</em>, that's also just how life is. It's boring, and awkward, and if the appeal of <em>Terrace House</em> was seeing that kind of stuff play out on your TV screen, please know that <em>The Boyfriend </em>does much the same thing.</p><p>Just this time around, it's (hopefully) doing it in a safer way.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Arkadium is an online games platform known for creating casual web browser games such as Mahjong, Bubble Shooters, and Crosswords. They have now launched a publishing service for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-1440p-resolution-and-120-fps-gameplay-for-pc-users-adds-six-new-games/">browser games</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this, they offer third-party publishing to browser-based developers, following their successful developer program, which opened in April. In addition to the third-party publishing, they have established a new $1 million fund to help developers and provide them with the resources needed to work on their projects.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, Arkadium has also announced that they have teamed up with Sony Pictures Entertainment to release an official Who Wants To Be A Billionaire? video game. In addition to the Who Wants To Be A Billionaire video game, they have announced six new titles being released under the new publishing arm.</p>
<p>This includes Categories and Room Escapes by Article 19, Element Blocks and Zoo Boom by Famobi, Multiplayer Chess Online by Foony and Ridella by Dylan Kappor.</p>
<p>Arkadium released a statement alongside this announcement: "Our new Arkadium publishing initiative builds on our 'Arkadium for Developers' program with even more support for game developers to succeed on browser," stated Arkadium's Director of Developer Relations, Dan Butchko.</p>
<p>"This is the next step in our continuing growth as the leader of the browser-based game sector as we build the world's best gaming platform alongside some of the most innovative and passionate game creators."</p>
<p>Browser games are often used by those who don't have access to a full gaming PC or those who are in school and use browser games to avoid doing their work. They are utilized in many situations, and Arkadium's opening up its company to third-party developers is a great sign of things to come for browser games. The firm offers a 75% revenue share model, with game creators all over the globe being allowed to submit their games to the Arkadium for Developers program.</p>
<p>Utilizing the<a href="https://corporate.arkadium.com/newsroom/arkadium-opens-its-vast-distribution-network-to-developers-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Arkadium for Developers</a> program, they hope to release 30 new titles over 2024, using the new initiative well.</p>
