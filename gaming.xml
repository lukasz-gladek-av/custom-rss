<p>This will be the second direct for the upcoming Illumination sequel, which is due to arrive in cinemas on 3rd April 2026. Last time, we found out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">Bowser Jr. and Rosalina</a> would be part of the cast.</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch to the Direct on either YouTube or Nintendo's website, and it kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Mon) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>We've had a couple of clips and teasers since the last Direct, but in a recent interview, the voice Mario (in the movies, at least) Chris Pratt teased that there <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">would be more recognisable characters</a> making their appearance in the sequel.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps we'll be seeing them this Sunday? Will Yoshi finally make his long-rumoured appearance?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Let us know if you'll be watching the Direct in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vampire-crawlers-demo-launch-in-one-month/</link>
            <guid>1414240</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Vampire Crawlers</strong>, the first spin-off of <strong>2022 indie sensation Vampire Survivors</strong>, will soon be available to play thanks to a free demo. Developer <strong>poncle</strong> announced that the demo will be released <strong>on February 23</strong> for <strong>PC </strong>via Steam (during next month's Steam Next Fest) and for <strong>Xbox</strong>. The full game will also be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, but there's no info on demos for those platforms.</p>



<p>The announcement comes alongside the first episode of a new video series called “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers”. The video series consists of <strong>bite-sized gameplay reveals</strong> in which the developer will share more about the features and gameplay of the upcoming rogue-like deckbuilding game.</p>



<p>In the debut episode, the team dives into the two key pillars of the Vampire Crawlers experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Turboturn</strong>: turn-based combat without the wait. In Vampire Crawlers, <strong>you can trigger your next move without having to wait for animations to finish</strong>. The game intelligently stacks and executes your ability inputs with precision, enabling you to play at your own chaotic pace. This, according to poncle, transforms tactical combat into a fast-paced, engaging, and visually rewarding experience.</li>



<li><strong>Card customization</strong>: discover endless ways to play your cards. <strong>Gems allow you to customise your cards with a variety of effects</strong>, ranging from raw damage multipliers to full weapon evolutions. Whether you're after a simple power boost or deep strategic planning, Gems provide every player with the tools to create game-breaking combos.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>On the heels of Vampire Survivors, which has sold an estimated ten million copies on Valve's platform alone, developer poncle has already convinced over 200K Steam users to wishlist Vampire Crawlers in the short span of two months since the game's announcement. Matching the incredible success of Survivors won't be easy, but the small indie team would likely be happy even with just a fifth of that.</p>

Well, it's launching in February, at any rate.</p><p>Per a press release, <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>' Early Access period starts on February 26th, but before that date rolls around, there's a second closed beta to participate in should you wish to. That kicks off on January 29th and comes to an end on February 2nd.</p><p>As for what you can expect from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedfa7a4-f771-4828-a192-0f8c25580a6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">competitive multiplayer title</a>'s second beta, Quantic Dream says the game will come complete with "a range of new content and technical improvements", including a new map and more.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>' second beta, as well as its Early Access launch, will be along soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The new map is The Nordic Shore, a five-lane arena with "open sightlines, harsh environmental conditions, and a unique pattern" for players to get to grips with.</p><p>It's joined by a new in-game intro and tutorial to help new players get into <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>, as well as in-game text chat for teams, a player reporting system (for such a thing must come alongside text chat), and customization for spellcasters.</p><p>Of course, since there is now customization, there must also be microtransactions, and so this update is also introducing a range of cosmetic packs you can buy, with costs ranging from $8.99 to a slightly alarming $69.99.</p><p>Quantic Dream has also altered the system specs for <em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>for this beta. Revised specs are as follows.</p><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li data-list-item-id="eeb3a782e487e3110098c63fb25ed9a96">CPU: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li data-list-item-id="e55f07f09d07039d8ef08064511115ebd">GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700</li><li data-list-item-id="eb02ca3e7fe7c53c726a169e2f41d5a06">16GB RAM, NVMe SSD, Windows 11</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li data-list-item-id="e671ad249f3b9c2b4956c4b95dded54a1">CPU: Intel Core i7-10700K or AMD Ryzen 7 2700</li><li data-list-item-id="ec4172b3af1465a1f60d7d12f6053762f">GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 or AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT</li><li data-list-item-id="e563b3b634cad9c84027fa2e6cade7c10">16GB RAM, NVMe SSD, Windows 11</li></ul>
<p>As for Quantic Dream's other project, <em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, there's still no news, unfortunately, although Quantic Dream did apparently manage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="443866cd-9f19-4b01-9659-841beff2381f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">escape the recent NetEase employee and studio purge</a>, so that's something, at least.</p><p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>launches in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458470/Spellcasters_Chronicles/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> on February 26th.

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 VR Modder Locks Out Subscribers After New DMCA: ‘People On The Web Are Thirsty For Blood’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-luke-ross-patreon-2000662571</link>
            <guid>1414222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modder who goes by Luke Ross has made full VR modes for some of the biggest blockbuster games around. He’s now decided to take them all offline, at least for now. After reportedly trying and failing to get CD Projekt Red to pay him for a full-conversion VR mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, Ross was hit earlier this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">with a DMCA takedown notice</a> from the Polish RPG maker. The modder has now been hit with another DMCA from the publisher of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghostrunner-is-actually-the-fall-s-sharpest-cyberpunk-g-1845917183"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a>, and has decided to suspend his entire Patreon, where access to dozens of other VR mods is locked behind a subscriber paywall, for at least the next month.</p> <p>“In light of the above facts, I’m being forced to take immediate action. I’m making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims,” Ross wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">a reported email to subscribers last night</a> (via <em><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a></em>). “And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I’m making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p>

 <p>The dramatic move came after Ross reportedly feared losing access to the account entirely after a takedown notice from Ghostrunner publisher 505 Games. “No mention of any terms of service violation this time,” wrote the modder. “Again Patreon automatically complied. I don’t blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don’t like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p> <p>Ross’ frustration with the publishers who own the games he’s modding and the power dynamics of modern DMCA threats on the internet is clear throughout the email, but the modder also tries to address criticisms charging for the mods in the first place. Central to CDPR’s complaint against the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 VR</em> mod was that Ross was charging players to access it via a subscription. As with a similar VR mod for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the normally pro-mod game maker reiterated that it would be fine with Ross making the creations free and simply allowing users to voluntarily tip instead, as many other modders do.</p>

 <p>“People on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the <em>GTA V</em> and <em>RDR 2</em> era, an article came out stating that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">I was raising $20,000 a month</a>. Is that ‘reasonable?'” Ross wrote. “Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support Cyberpunk, turning it into the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02UCNXLJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc">most immersive gaming experience</a>” some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of <em>Cyberpunk</em>‘s publisher? Something tells me it wouldn’t be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting <em>CP2077</em> to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt Red.”</p>

 <p>Ross’ thankless crusade hasn’t won over the gaming masses quiet yet. He accused users of trying to pirate the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod even after it was taken down in order <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">to “punish” him</a>&nbsp;for breaking CDPR’s terms of service. “Wouldn’t making his mod free and accepting optional donations make him bulletproof to all claims?” asked one commenter on the VR subreddit where Ross’ latest email was shared. “Guy wants so bad to make some nice cash out of this, and got so upset that he is not even considering alternative ‘business models,’ he just said fuck it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station converts a USB-C connector on your computer or tablet into a multi-connection hub for additional monitors, storage devices, and accessories. Aluminum construction gives this docking station a slender profile that houses 7 connections, 2 HDMI video connections, 2 USB-A data connections, 2 USB-C data connections, and a dedicated input for powering the unit. In addition, you can connect monitors, storage devices, and a charger with a single, compact adapter, eliminating the need to manage multiple adapters/dongles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/"><span>Visit Amazon and purchase the UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station for only $26, down from the regular price of $37, for a 31% savings.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station to collect all your important tech in one place</h2>
<p><span>With this dock, you can drive two external monitors at resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160) and refresh rates up to 60Hz via its two HDMI ports. You can duplicate your primary screen on the second monitor, or expand your desktop to an additional monitor, freeing up space on the original monitor for other applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The four 10 Gb/s data ports provide the space for connecting your most frequently used peripherals. This dock has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors that support connecting external solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, keyboards, mice, etc., at much faster speeds than USB 2.0 ports. As these connectors are designed primarily to transfer data, and not to charge your laptop or to output video, they enable you to move large files and back up your data to external storage devices more rapidly.</span></p>



<p><span>There is a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery port on this dock that lets you keep your laptop charged even when the dock is connected to it. It can accept up to 100W of power from a compatible USB-C charger and pass power to the host cable. So, a single connection to the dock can perform both charging and expansion functions. Only power is transferred through the PD port, allowing the other 10 Gb/s ports to be used for data transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>The aluminum housing of this dock is compact, yet sturdy enough to withstand normal usage without being bulky in your travel case. The small size of the dock, combined with a relatively short host cable, minimizes clutter and prevents adjacent ports on the side of your laptop from being obstructed by the dock. You can either permanently keep this dock on a desk or include it in a travel kit with a charger and HDMI cables. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/">At a sale price of $26, down from its original list price of $37</a>, the UGREEN 7-in-1 docking station is a great solution that provides two 4K-resolution HDMI outputs, high-speed data ports, and power-through charging via a single USB-C connector.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 Xbox Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The official Forza Horizon 6 reveal was incredible. It showcased everything Playground Games has been working on for the Japanese-inspired sequel, and if you’re already revving up your car in excitement, it’s time to fill you in on Forza Horizon 6’s Xbox Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Is it safe to say that Forza Horizon 6 is the biggest racing game of 2026? It will take a lot to top it, and with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay footage revealed</a> so far, it’s hard to argue. Playing it is a must, and with the confusion surrounding Xbox Game Pass in recent times, it’s brought FH6 into the spotlight.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-6-releasing-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Forza Horizon 6 Releasing On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A speedy success beckons. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will officially launch as a day-one Xbox Game Pass offering, meaning you’ll get it for free if you have the correct subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The whole Game Pass price increase controversy in 2025 raised big questions about future launches. These doubts have been dispelled about Forza Horizon 6, though, and you only have to look to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> itself for the answer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arriving for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Steam, and day one with Game Pass Ultimate. Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Pass is more expensive now, but you’ll still be able to have access to certain full-price AAA games. There are still good times and games on the horizon (pun intended).</p>







<h2 id="h-which-version-of-xbox-game-pass-is-needed-to-play-forza-horizon-6">Which Version Of Xbox Game Pass Is Needed To Play Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p><strong>You need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Forza Horizon 6 for free.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not free, technically, but you understand the concept. It’s better than paying $60, $70, or $80. This does mean you need the most expensive version of the Game Pass model, and here’s how to get it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox website</a>.</li>



<li>Press to Join Game Pass.</li>



<li>An option will appear with three tiers.</li>



<li>You need to click <strong>Select </strong>under the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tier.</li>



<li>Complete your subscription.</li>



<li>Once Forza Horizon 6 debuts, you can download it and play it as part of XGP Ultimate.</li>
</ol>



<p>Knowing that Forza Horizon 6 is coming to Game Pass should make a lot of people happy. If you are a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, look forward to entering the new world of Horizon. Also, head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and leave a message to say if FH6 is enough to get you to sign up with Game Pass. Conversely, pop a message down to say why it <em>isn’t </em>enough, if it’s the case.</p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been announced for next week.</p>



<p>First revealed through the <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-US/contents/04020be1-e2e8-49eb-8282-a99fb58f27c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Today</a> app, this upcoming direct will take place at 9am ET/6am PT on Sunday, January 25.</p>







<p>It’s the second-straight Nintendo Direct event to specifically be about the movie. The last one took place on November 12, 2025, and gave fans a first look at the new trailer along with introducing Bowser Jr. and Rosalina to the film. </p>



<p>The next Direct is likely to give a new trailer, the reveal of new characters, and, possibly, the stars who voice them. There are rumors and leaks suggesting Yoshi will also be in the movie, but the green dinosaur has yet to be seen on camera.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. It’s currently scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. That’s almost three years to the day of the original movie’s release.</p>

This process came after the decision was made not to develop any further content for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and while Mass Effect 5 officially remains in the pre-production phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as work on Mass Effect 5 quietly continues, BioWare is hiring a Production Director for the game who will report directly into the project's overall boss, BioWare and Mass Effect franchise veteran Mike Gamble.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hi, I'm hiring a very important senior leadership role," Gamble <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/2014438853273387358?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "They'll report to me and it's gonna be awesome." A <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description</a> notes that the role will involve partnering with Mass Effect 5's "creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game's vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since 1995, BioWare has been dedicated to creating games defined by rich storytelling, unforgettable characters, and expansive worlds," the job description continues. "Over the years, the studio has earned recognition for developing some of the industry's most critically acclaimed titles. Today, BioWare is building on that legacy with the development of the next Mass Effect game, continuing one of the highest-rated and most celebrated series in video game history."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mass-effect-revealed">BioWare first announced plans to make Mass Effect 5 back in 2020</a> — a date that now feels a lifetime ago — in part to simply reassure fans that it remained committed to the franchise. In reality, though, the company was still busy devoting most of its development efforts into getting Dragon Age: The Veilguard done and out the door. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mass Effect: Next Chapter Game Award Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During this time, BioWare is believed to have had only a small team working on its next Mass Effect game concept, while the bulk of the studio was busy elsewhere. With The Veilguard finally launched in late 2024, Mass Effect 5 became the sole focus of the studio — albeit in its newly-slimmed down form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamble previously confirmed that Mass Effect 5 was being led by a team of fellow Mass Effect veterans who served key roles on the franchise's original three games, including art director Derek Watts, creative director Parrish Ley, senior level designer and Normandy programmer Dusty Everman, and game director Preston Watmaniuk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leadership team behind Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including its lead writer, senior systems designer, various editors, producer and both its co-directors, Corinne Busche and John Epler, are all no longer at the company following the studio's downsizing, meanwhile.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Consecutive years have seen BioWare release snippets of concept art and other brief teasers for the game, which is expected to be set hundreds of years after the end of the original Mass Effect trilogy and feature at least one returning character. At the same time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">pre-production has also begun on Amazon Prime's Mass Effect TV series</a> that will also be set after the events of the trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">Gamble wrote in a blog post last November</a>. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble continued today. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare has given no indication of when Mass Effect 5 will arrive, though here's hoping 2026 brings a better sense of the company's progress as development ramps up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> ended 2025 as the best-selling game in the U.S., beating its first-person shooter rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which ended down in fifth place. Black Ops 6, which also launched day one on Game Pass, was 2024’s number one best-selling game in the U.S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to sales data from Circana, EA’s Battlefield 6 finished as 2025’s best-selling video game in tracked full game dollar sales. It's the first time a Battlefield game has outsold a Call of Duty game. Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 ranked first on both Xbox and the aggregated PC storefronts for the year while placing second on PlayStation behind only NBA 2K26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 had a massive launch in October 2025, breaking franchise records by selling over 7 million copies in its first three days and becoming the best-selling game of 2025 by revenue. This launch, coupled with the release of the hugely popular extraction shooter, Arc Raiders, put enormous pressure on Black Ops 7, which has disappointed in sales terms. Indeed, Black Ops 7’s fifth place finish is the lowest for a mainline Call of Duty game since Call of Duty: World at War ended up at number six in 2008.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, however, a number of factors we should take into consideration when analyzing Black Ops 7’s performance. The number one is that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard, has yet to announce any sales number for the game, in the U.S. or globally, so we’re lacking that important data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know that Black Ops 7 (November 14) launched after Battlefield 6 (October 10), so had fewer days to count sales for the year. And then there’s the Game Pass factor. As a Microsoft game, Black Ops 7 launched day one on Game Pass, where it has trended high in terms of engagement since release. It is thought that Call of Duty’s day one release on Microsoft’s subscription service impacts sales, at the least on Xbox consoles, and perhaps also on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Black Ops 7 finished the year relatively strong. It was December’s best-selling game across physical and tracked digital spending, Circana said. 2025 marked the seventh consecutive year a Call of Duty game has been December’s best seller, with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate topping the chart in December 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there can be no doubting Black Ops 7’s sales struggle compared to 2024’s Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider"><u>European sales figures</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>Activision's own admissions</u></a>. Following the release of Black Ops 7, Activision announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the Call of Duty franchise, including promising never to release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops). Activision released Modern Warfare 2 in 2022, Modern Warfare 3 in 2023, Black Ops 6 in 2024, and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-claims-activision-call-of-duty-and-consoles-are-doing-so-poorly-it-proves-he-was-right-to-sell-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-for-69-billion">former Activision boss Bobby Kotick claimed Call of Duty sales were down 60% year-on-year</a> — although he provided no evidence to back up his claim and neither Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have commented in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Battlefield 6, it's had struggles of its own since its explosive launch, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1">Season 2 delayed</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">an apparent loss of moment on Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your take on the Call of Duty vs Battlefield sales war, Epic’s Fortnite led the year in total active users across both PlayStation and Xbox platforms, according to Circana’s Player</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Engagement Tracker, with over half of all active users of the two ecosystems engaging with Fortnite at least once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox was 2025’s leading publisher in digital at retail spending (including gift cards, code on receipts, etc.) for both December and the 2025 year.

            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak is working with multiple partner companies on its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>During last night's Xbox Developer Direct, Game Freak gave us all another look at Beast of Reincarnation, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, who along with her canine companion Koo will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation all looks really rather promising, with many noting it was quite different and larger than Game Freak's other games outside of Pokémon. So, did the studio have to increase its numbers for the upcoming release? Well, not exactly. Rather, it has called in the help from a number of outside companies and fellow developers to get things going.</p>
<p>"The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak," Beast of Reincarnation's game director told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>"We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realise the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well."</p><p>A PR further clarified with the publication that Game Freak's internal team working on Beast of Reincarnation is actually "relatively small". However, that team is made up of those in core direction and management roles, and who are leading the project.</p>

            <p>
Following its slam-dunk first season, Amazon's TV adaption of Fallout has, according to reports earlier this year, faced a bit of a sophomore slump in terms of viewership. But despite an apparent dip in popularity, Amazon has now revealed enough people are still tuning into the show that it's officially Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time.
</p>
<p>
Back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">in January</a>, media valuation and data analytics company Nielsen reported that between 15th and 21st December, Fallout's season two premiere and eight earlier season one episodes managed to accumulate a combined 794m viewing minutes. That's a big number, but also well below the 2.9bn viewing minutes season one's eight episodes attracted in its opening week in April 2024. Further raising questions about Fallout's second season success is the fact Amazon - which was quick to talk up some impressive figures first time around - has been keeping quiet about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
That, though, has now changed. While Amazon is still not talking specific viewership numbers, it's shared some comparative information giving at least some indication of just how well Fallout season two (which is being released weekly unlike season one, and which is yet to air its final two episodes) has so far done. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/fallout-season-2-viewership-update-explained-amazon-1236692296/">reported by Deadline</a>, Amazon is calling Fallout's latest instalment the top-performing season on Prime Video since Reacher Season 3, which debuted back in February 2025.
</p>
<p>
It's also being described as Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time. That, if you're wondering, puts it behind the series' debut season, the first two seasons of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Reacher's second and third seasons. And if we're purely talking Prime Video's most successful <em>returning</em> seasons, Fallout Season 2 comes in at fourth place.
</p><p>
"We are thrilled with the Fallout S2 reception from audiences and critics globally," Peter Friedlander, Amazon MGM Studios' head of global TV, said to Deadline. "After its first four weeks, Fallout S2 already ranks as the sixth most watched season ever on Prime Video and is even higher rated on Rotten Tomatoes than S1. More than half of the season's audience to-date has come from outside the US, and we're excited for even more viewers to discover the show as we continue to release new episodes over the weeks ahead."
</p>
<p>
Regardless of season two's success, Amazon has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">committed to a third season</a>, with production due to start on 1st May, 2026. And whatever happens beyond that, it's clear the company continues to have confidence in the Fallout property. It's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-newly-announced-fallout-reality-show-will-plop-competitors-inside-a-vault-to-find-out-just-how-special-they-are">announced a reality show based on the Fallout games</a> that'll see contestants living inside a real-life Vault. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, as it's known, will run for 10 episodes when it eventually airs on Prime Video.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Fabraz and publisher Atari have revealed the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>release date, so if you think everyone's (least?) favorite bobcat deserves one more shot, then it's nearly time to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p>As revealed by Atari <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/2014345190346011105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>will be arriving on PC and consoles on May 22nd, and if, for some reason, you'd like to pre-order the game, you can do so now on your platform of choice.</p><p>It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubsy-bobcat-makes-his-grand-return-for-some-reason" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db3d0244-1ad5-4c64-ad19-5f7ed0f148aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no secret</a> that <em>Bubsy </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-woolies-strike-back-review-bubsy-is-still-bad" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef96e2fa-8978-4a24-b83d-f084a4633ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">aren't exactly well-received</a> by and large, but Fabraz, whose name you might recognize from 3D platformer <em>Demon Turf </em>and 2D offering <em>Slime-san</em>, is hoping it can change all that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Could <em>Bubsy 4D </em>finally be the game to turn the franchise around?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This time around, Bubsy is making a return to 3D, which feels like a pretty ballsy move given how things went for the bobcat's last excursion into the third dimension.</p><p>As you'd probably expect (and as is probably necessary given <em>Bubsy</em>'s history), <em>Bubsy 4D </em>is taking a self-aware approach; Bubsy himself is returning to the fold after a long absence, and characters around him frequently question whether he's up to the job.</p><p>The game itself is a fairly straightforward 3D collectathon platformer in which Bubsy must navigate a series of "expansive craft-themed levels" and do battle with vicious BaaBots in order to recover his beloved Golden Fleece.</p><p>You can check out the new release date announcement trailer for <em>Bubsy 4D </em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect if you decide to humor the bobcat one last time.</p>
<p>I've been talking smack about <em>Bubsy </em>for this whole piece, but I won't lie: I'm actually rooting for Fabraz and Atari on this one, because I played the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>demo, and it's...well, it's quite fun. Don't tell anyone I said that.</p><p>In any case, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/bubsy-4d/9P82VZJSZWGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch on May 22nd. Stay tuned to find out whether it's actually decent like the demo.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-mini-gaming-pc-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-drops-to-an-all-time-low-as-amazon-starts-offloading-a-top-rated-tiny-pc-2000662379</link>
            <guid>1414162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="336" data-end="594">If you’re in the market for desktop-level chops without the gargantuan footprint, the <span><span>KAMRUI Hyper H2 Mini Gaming PC</span></span> is currently living its best discounted life on Amazon&nbsp; — and it’s worth a long, hard look if you want serious oomph that won’t swallow your entire desk. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Its resume is topped by an Amazon’s Choice designation, an average 4.6-star rating, and best of all, an all-time-low price of $510 after a 38% price drop.</a></p>
<p data-start="596" data-end="929">This pocket-sized powerhouse packs a 13th-gen Intel Core i7-13620H — that’s 10 cores and 16 threads that can crank at up to 4.9 GHz — straight into a tiny box that can take up a near-invisible residence behind your monitor with a VESA mount. It’s essentially a Mac Mini for the Windows crowd, except at a better price and with far more expansion options.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="596" data-end="929">Mini With Muscle</h2>
<p data-start="931" data-end="1258">The hand-sized chassis of the Kamrui Hyper H2 conceals a wealth of power under the hood, particularly when you consider the $510 price tag. You get 32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD — plenty of breathing room for your game library, creative tools, and whatever else you need. And if that storage starts feeling cramped, there’s room to grow it even more — the RAM can go up to 64GB and the SSD as high as 4TB. (Try that with a Mac Mini.)</p>
<p data-start="1260" data-end="1576">The Hyper H2 expands its bona fides by driving up to three&nbsp;4K displays simultaneously (HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C with USB4 for 40 Gbps transfer speeds are among the Hyper H2’s many ports), making it downright mean for multi-monitor setups, streaming, or editing workflows that need space to breathe.</p>
<p data-start="1578" data-end="1821">The connections are totally up to date — Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 keep wireless peripherals and networking humming, while a 2.5 GbE LAN port gives you the option of a faster wired lane for big downloads or local server flexing.</p>


<h2 data-start="1578" data-end="1821">Time to Game (Up to a Point)</h2>
<p data-start="1823" data-end="2312">Kamrui refers to the Hyper H2 as a gaming PC, and that’s true — to a point. The reality check says it’s still got integrated graphics, so if you’re trying to play <em data-start="1911" data-end="1923">Elden Ring</em> at 4K max settings, you’ll be disappointed. But for midrange gaming titles, eSports classics, and virtually every productivity task you can toss its way, this little cube punches well above its weight and its price. Think <em>Fortnite-</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals-</em> style playability, plus easy cruising through creative workloads and everyday multitasking without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p data-start="2314" data-end="2571">In a world where gaming desks are already crowded with keyboards, mice, monitors, and that one mystery USB gadget you swear you bought for some reason that now escapes you, a desktop that <em data-start="2465" data-end="2481">shrinks itself</em> while still delivering decent performance is kind of a flex. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Especially at this price now that it’s at its lowest point ever at Amazon — just $510 while this deal is still in place.</a></p>

            <p>Playground Games offered the first in-depth look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, in addition to confirming its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-might-have-raced-onto-the-streets-faster-than-planned-thanks-to-an-ad">leaked release date of May 19th</a>.

<p>This feature's dubbed The Estate, and it's a big barren bit of land designed to let you build whatever sort of settlement/hangout you like. The concept seems quite like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the face of it, with this patch of rundown rural property mirroring Tomiko's Homestead as a sprawling home base you can wander back to if you fancy a break from driving around.</p>
<p>According to Playground design director Torben Ellert, The Estate comprises an entire mountain valley, which "starts off completely empty and overgrown, but once you unlock it, you can build and decorate directly in the open world here. And anything you construct is permanent and visitable by your friends." An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire post</a> offers a bit more detail, with this space being designed to mirror abandoned bits of rural property referred to in Japan as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Akiya/">Akiya</a>. "Being responsible for an Akiya is really rooted in community, you take on the job of refurbishing somewhere that’s useful and meaningful to the people around you," Ellert added in that post.</p><p>So, you can serve the community by building a giant private racetrack for you and your mates to lap, or designing some cross between a car dealership and a Bond villain's lair. I'll likely opt for a mix of both if I can be bothered, but honestly I can't say this is ever something I've yearned for a Horizon to have. The various purchasable player homes around the map have always done the trick whenever I've felt the need to stop and scroll through my garage or install some upgrades. There are still eight of those in Horizon 6, and each boast their own visually customisable garage space for the first time.</p>
<p>So, on the outside you've got a building handcrafted by the devs to fit aesthetically into the space in Horizon's Japanese landscape which it occupies, plus an interior space you can personalise without having to worry about potentially ending up thinking a bit of the map looks a tad more generic or artificial than the rest whenever you drive past it. In my eyes, that's the best of both worlds, and the garage customisation on its own is certainly a new addition I dig. The world also has permanent car meets you can head along to if you want a space to show off your exotic ride to other players.</p>
<p>Going back to The Estate, I could envision myself being more on board with using it as a base if Horizon 6's player homes had been left a bit more akin to Shadows' Kakuregas - purposefully small and customisation-free pit-stops designed to let you quickly take a break or replenish your stuff before you get right back on the road. As is, I'm left wondering if I'll end up looking at the empty section of Horizon 6's otherwise strenuously crafted map as a gap I'd have preferred Playground to fill in themselves.</p>

		</div>
	<div>
		<p>In 1993, I left Canada’s eastern coast and moved to Toronto for graduate school. I immediately fell in love. It can be hard for someone who is not from here to understand the vast distance, more than physical or geographic, separating Toronto from the Canadian Atlantic coastal communities where I grew up. Toronto was a place of endless possibility, and I know how cliche that sounds, but that makes it no less true for the twenty-something who disembarked straight into the euphoria of the Toronto Blue Jays winning their second straight World Series. I leapt to my feet when <a href="https://youtu.be/-F5HwiGm7lg?si=4mEx49L3n7CDfMad&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Joe Carter’s walk-off home run</u></a> cleared the left field wall and ran to join the throngs on Yonge Street.</p><p>It took 32 years for Toronto to make it back. No celebration this time.</p><p>The Blue Jays playoff 2025 playoff run inspired a nationwide explosion of love and devotion that was almost unprecedented. They became Canada’s team not simply by default - they are the only major league based in Canada since the departure of my beloved Montreal Expos twenty years ago—but by adoption; a full-hearted embrace unseen in recent years.</p><p>It is important to note that the Blue Jays are owned by Rogers Communications, owners of the largest Canadian sports television network, as well as of a controlling interest in Maple Leafs Sports Entertainment (MLSE) (owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Toronto Raptors, Toronto Football Club, and the Toronto Argonauts). Rogers also owns the cable TV and cellphone accounts of millions of Canadians. If you are into sports, Rogers controls both media and message. With all the corporate bandwagon jumping, there’s a faint whiff of astroturf, a manufactured national rally. It’s easy to be cynical about the enthusiasm of this past fall.</p><p>I am not a cynic. Certainly not about baseball.</p>

              <p>The Google Pixel 9a Smartphone emphasizes camera capabilities and AI features, as well as a high-quality battery, in a 6.3-inch Android smartphone that will remain simple to carry. You receive an unlocked 5G smartphone with 8 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage, allowing you to run all your usual apps and store a large number of pictures and videos. The screen supports a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, providing smoother scrolling and animation while navigating apps, feeds, and video games. Plus, it has IP68 water- and dust-resistance, a scratch-resistant screen, and a solid frame that protects against water and dust exposure and can withstand small drops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">Click here to purchase the Google Pixel 9a Smartphone at $399, down from $499, which is a $100 discount and a 20% reduction.</a></p>

<h2>A versatile smartphone with plenty of AI-centric features</h2>
<p>Pixel Cameras are designed to take great photographs, and once you have taken a picture, you can use the camera’s A.I. to further refine the image if you want greater control. The rear wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras enable users to capture large vistas and tight compositions, and features such as Add Me and Best Take allow users to salvage a group shot that includes individuals who may have blinked or were outside the frame.</p>
<p>Macro Focus lets you zoom in on items such as textures, plants, and very small objects, so their finer details become apparent. AI photo editing lets you remove distractions and adjust lighting to be consistent throughout the image, without exporting to a separate editor.</p>



<p>The Pixel 9a’s battery life is powered by Adaptive Battery and rated for more than 30 hours of use on a single charge. If needed, Extreme Battery Saver can extend battery life to approximately 100 hours by limiting the number of lower-priority apps running in the background while conserving power. Fast Wired Charging lets you quickly recharge the battery when you do not have access to a charger for an extended period, and Wireless Charging lets you place the phone on a compatible wireless pad rather than searching for a charging cable.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a Smartphone offers numerous features, including durability, security, and long-term support. Its IP68 rating and reinforced design protect against dust and liquids, as well as damage from drops. Safety features enable the detection of potential theft, automatically lock your data, and assist in detecting a car accident and initiating emergency calls. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6717/">At a discounted price of $399, reduced from the original list price of $499, the Pixel 9a offers significant value in a small-footprint 6.3-inch frame.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft has confirmed Beyond Good and Evil 2 - which it first announced almost two decades ago - remains a priority for the studio, and "fits with [its] strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft left many in shock when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>

<p>One game to survive, though, was Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was first announced in its original form back in 2008, and last seen (at least publicly) during E3 2017 with an open-world slant. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Ubisoft spokesperson has said:</p>
<p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures."</p>
<p>The studio's spokesperson added that within thiz market, "the fantasy genre is underserved". Therefore, Ubisoft has a "unique proposition" with its  Beyond Good and Evil sequel.</p>

</figure>
<p>It has not been an easy path for Beyond Good and Evil 2, though there has been some movement in recent years. In 2024, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">got a new creative director</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>.</p><p>Last year, meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unbelievably-17-years-after-its-original-announcement-ubisoft-appears-to-still-be-hiring-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2">job listing looking for a technical sound designer specifically for Beyond Good and Evil 2 was shared by Ubisoft</a>. At this time, we also got an updated description of what Beyond Good and Evil 2 will actually be:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good and Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p></blockquote>

<p>As for elsewhere at Ubisoft, this week's cancellations included the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">was only a few months from its planned release</a>. </p>
<p>While the team behind the remake has since called Sands of Time's cancellation "deeply disappointing" for fans and the development team, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">does not mean Ubisoft is "stepping away" from the Prince of Persia franchise for good</a>.</p>

            <p>Digital online PC game store GOG has acknowledged that it "damaged the trust our users have in us" when it abruptly removed the <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">acclaimed horror game Devotion</a> from sale just over five years ago.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflected on the decision after facing scrutiny for a comment he made - "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values" - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">an interview on Eurogamer</a> last week. That remark was made in relation to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Horses, the provocative indie horror game</a> that GOG would sell when other storefronts Steam and Epic would not. But the comments contradicted the stance GOG took with Devotion in late 2020.</p>
<p>To recap: Devotion is a short, smart, 1980s-set Taiwanese-made horror game - "a genre landmark", we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devotion-review">our Devotion review</a> - initially released in early 2019 but pulled from sale after an outcry over the inclusion of unflattering references to China's president Xi Jinping. This had dramatic consequences in China - developer Red Candle's Weibo social media account was closed - and the game was yanked from sale on Steam.</p>

<p>Red Candle insisted the offending asset was only ever a placeholder. It apologised at length for it, and removed it, so things seemed to settle enough for a prospective re-release. This is where GOG comes in. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-under-fire-for-dramatic-u-turn-on-devotion-gog-release">GOG announced it would sell the game but then on the same day reversed the decision</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817?s=20">stating</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Was it standing for the right values then?</p><p>Maciej Gołębiewski today said: "That situation remains difficult to reflect on. At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us.</p>
<blockquote><em>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values, I don't mean that we won't make mistakes"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But it's also important for us to be transparent," he added. "Keeping a global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility."</p>
<p>The situation with Horses he said was different. That game was played by multiple GOG employees who agreed that it didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners". "There was no other concern driving this decision," Gołębiewski remarked, "just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."</p><p>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values," he continued, "I don't mean that we won't make mistakes, or that every decision will be easy, or that we'll never face trade-offs. I do mean that with every given opportunity, we're striving to be clearer, more consistent, and more willing to stand behind our choices (including explaining them openly when they're being questioned)."</p>

<p>Gołębiewski's willingness to discuss the matter I believe shows a renewed push by GOG to be seen as open and approachable following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">its recent independence</a> - when it separated from the mothership CD Projekt, which it had always been a part of. GOG was under CD Projekt ownership when the Devotion situation occurred, so did that heap additional pressure on? CDP is a publicly traded company answerable to investors and had far bigger concerns to deal with at the time, such as righting the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As a private company now, GOG is answerable only to new owner Michal Kiciński, who, coincidentally, was one of the original founders of CD Projekt <em>and</em> one of the people who launched GOG - Kiciński remains a major shareholder at CD Projekt but he hasn't actively worked there since 2012. Under his ownership, GOG is now autonomous and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">he's apparently not afraid of taking a risk</a>. Nothing major is set to change, but the company is looking into the possibility of branching into indie game publishing. A new era has begun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last night’s Xbox Developer Direct stream was pretty good, wasn’t it? I’ve come to enjoy the way that Microsoft presents these, giving the spotlight to a small selection of games that are locked in for the year ahead, and always with one smaller surprise along the way. The most exciting thing was to really see and hear about Playground Games’ take on Fable, though, which looks like it’s going to capture so much of the British charm and whimsy.</p>
<p>But what about the games we can and are playing in the here and now? Well, I’ve made a belated start on Rennsport, setting up my racing wheel to dip a tyre into this racing sim. I’ll have some thoughts to share on it in a review at some point.</p>
<p>We’ll start with Dom this week, who’s been getting his blacksmithing skills up to snuff in Bladesong, enjoying its unusual atmosphere and feel, as well as playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes and Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2 for our reviews. He’s also somehow ended up checking in each day on a new Animal Crossing island. He says “somehow”, but this was totally my fault for needing a buddy to try out the new online features…</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hopping around on rocks this week, but has been doing so while embodying an adorable fox and getting lost while playing Spirit of the North 2 with Ade. <strong>Ade</strong>, meanwhile, has mostly been enjoying Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 6 – “With the launch of season 6, the game is the best it’s ever been. Faster gameplay, silky smooth animation, punchy and responsive combat, and a nerfed Daredevil. For anyone who understandably bounced off the rather rough version of Marvel Rivals we got at launch, it’s definitely worth a revisit.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> is coming to the end of two games, reaching the summit of Cairn for our upcoming review, and coming to the conclusion of Ghost of Yotei which (and he can’t believe he’s saying it for an open world game) is actually too small.</p>

<p>MIO: Memories in Orbit largely delighted <strong>Aran</strong> for our review this week, with just some frustrating patches getting in the way of a visually stunning and challenging game. Now he’s gone back to Star Wars Outlaws to roam Tatooine, searching for treasure, and making mischief.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has hopped back into Last Epoch this week, and thinks ” it still has the coolest skill system of just about any game I’ve played. Being able to respec constantly is also very soothing for my poor addled brain.”</p>
<p>Playing Xbox but on PS5 is still a bit strange, but it has meant that <strong>Jim</strong> has been able to drop into Sea of Thieves, matchmaking with crews to go on voyages, and experiencing Hellblade 2 this week. “I’m just the past the halfway point and while I enjoyed the opening hour or so, this middle portion has really dragged with boring, drawn out environmental puzzles that act as filler between the occasional bout of combat.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> found it a bit tricky to focus this week with his gaming, jumping into the “shameless RE ripoff” of Ebola Village, bouncing off Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and loading up Gigasword as a bedtime Steam Deck game. He’s also set to explore the weird world of game streaming soon with some upcoming horror games, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Miguel</strong>, who’s been playing a bunch of Code Vein 2 for our review next week, a sprinkling of the silly co-op of The Outlast Trials and Peak, and getting his extraction shooter fix with Synduality: Echo of Ada.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

However, we are living in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">very challenging times</strong> for console manufacturers, who must deal with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current economic situation and<a href="https://wccftech.com/asgard-launches-256-gb-ddr5-memory-kit-at-the-price-of-nvidia-rtx-5090/"> soaring RAM prices</a></strong> as they prepare the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox.</strong></p>



<p>Although neither Sony nor Microsoft has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">openly addressed the situation,</strong> which is expected to remain challenging for a few years at best, it is very likely to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/"><strong>impact their next-generation plans significantly</strong></a>. So much so that a known analyst is expecting the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6 to be delayed</strong> from the expected 2027/2028 release date.</p>

While the report looks at Sony's entire operation, including the television and music businesses, the observations on the company's <strong>Gaming Division</strong> are the most interesting.</p>



<p>For the third quarter, Sony's results are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"expected to beat market expectations, driven by sales of both in-house and third-party games."</em> These results will likely make it easier for Sony to extend the current console generation, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Sony expects the PlayStation 5's lifecycle to be extended</em>, with the <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">PlayStation 6 likely to be </em><em>"</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">delayed longer than many expected."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a delay of the next console generation</strong> isn't something we are hearing this month for the first time, the prediction coming from an expert analyst definitely gives more weight to the prospect. However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a longer delay into 2029/2030</strong> or even beyond would make the scenario very peculiar for the console industry, as Sony, and possibly Microsoft, would be sitting on hardware that will be outdated by 2030. </p>



<p>This wouldn't be completely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unprecedented</strong>, given that the Nintendo Switch 2 successfully launched in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/"><strong>later than even NVIDIA expected</strong></a>, and without cutting-edge technology, but it would still be new for both Sony and Microsoft. And under current conditions, it will likely be preferable to delay new systems rather than release them at a very high price that wouldn't make them compelling to the price-savvy console audience.</p>

            <p>The surprise game reveal at last night’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fables-evil-landlords-wont-grow-devil-horns-as-reboot-ditches-classic-character-morphing-due-to-a-lack-of-belief-in-objective-arseholery">Xbox Developer Direct</a> was Kiln, a pottery-based multiplayer party brawler in the works at Double Fine. Combatants take the form of pots, vases, dishes, and urns, custom-sculpted and fired by players themselves, and will usually end up smashed into shards of tragic ceramic in the following online slapfights. Or maybe not, as there’s apparently nothing stopping you from simply playing Kiln as a nonviolent pottery sim by sticking to its clay-shaping component alone.</p>
<p>"The whole pottery part is such that it grabs people who might not want to jump into a multiplayer game," project lead Derek Brand explained to Microsoft’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>. "Some people just want to try pot making."</p> <figure>

<p>Judging from the reveal trailer, there is something enticingly simple about Kiln’s brown goop manipulation. I’ve only tried the real thing once and ended up with a crap bowl, but the two-button pulling and squeezing system that Kiln brings to the spinny table is clearly designed to make crafting finer vessels much easier. Regardless of whether or not you’re being canoodled by Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p>Sponges and scrapers are on hand for adding texture, and there’s also a selection of handles, glazes, and decorative patterns to adorn your pots with. Offbrand Le Creuset or offbrand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">Iron Fist Alexander</a>? That’s up to you.</p>
<p>Brand did add that Kiln will at least try to tempt pacifist potters into the game’s fighty side, saying "...if we can, we just slowly ease them into the 'I want to punch something now with this pot.' We don’t want it to be a hard shift from those two things." Those who heed the call will join objective-led punchups where the design of their pots affects how they perform on the battlefield: tall vases, for instance, can carry more water (useful for the 4v4 'Quench' mode where the aim is to douse the enemy team’s oven) but move slower and, because of their height, are less stable when they move.</p>

</figure>
<p>Small plates, meanwhile, lack carrying capacity, but can unleash a special attack in which they bounce between enemies, chipping into them with sharp-edged rims. There are 24 of these moves in total, each dependent on a finished pot’s shape, and applying varying degrees of logic: sculpting a versatile mid-sized pot lets it shower enemies in a harmful rain of popcorn.</p>
<p>Yeah, I dunno. Do I have to put my pots in such mortal danger? I think I’d like my pots. Let my pots be, Kiln.</p>
<p>It’s out sometime in Spring 2026, PC and Game Pass included, and <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/sign-up-for-the-kiln-beta">beta playtest signups are open now</a>. Dedicated Double Fine followers may already be familiar with Kiln’s general homeware warfare angle, as it appeared as a prototype during the company’s Amnesia Fortnight game jam – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd7riA8vb8h1kP3jCFS_qtTM">broadcast on YouTube</a> – all the way back in 2017. It’s evidently struck a more colourful, jolly tone than that of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVJCxk5VDvA">original pitch</a>, though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doublefine.com/post/3md2bsg7k6k2u">Double Fine’s Bluesky account</a> says it’s stayed free of generative AI in the intervening years.</p>
