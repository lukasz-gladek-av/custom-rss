<p>Following what could be the worst year ever for Ubisoft, the publisher announced it would delay Assassin’s Creed Shadows to February 2025. While the third-person action game is “feature complete,” they want to spend the next few months polishing the experience to ensure it’s the studio’s best launch. Unfortunately, for those excited to play as Yasuke and Naoe, it leaves a hole in the holidays. Here’s what you can play following the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-new-assassin-s-creed-shadows-release-date">What is the New Assassin’s Creed Shadows Release Date?</h2>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the new release date for the third-person action game with stealth elements is <strong>February 14, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this means it will directly compete with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei in 2025</a>, along with a handful of major releases in February, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avowed</strong></li>



<li><strong>Civilization 7</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-games-to-play-after-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-delay">Games to Play After the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Delay</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows promises a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive open world to explore</a>, full of unique locations, quests, and characters, alongside action-packed gameplay. As such, we tried to choose similar titles that could mimic that feel, so there are a few Soulslike in here, like Elden Ring, but it’s important to note that Shadows isn’t Soulslike.</p>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-odyssey">Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you fancy yourself a completionist, you can beat <strong>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</strong> in approximately 140 to 150 hours. If you start now, there’s a chance you’ll finish the entire story and side quests before the launch of Shadows in February. Of course, Steam’s Winter Sale will probably impede your progress.</p>



<p>In any case, the story of Alexios and Kassandra spans Greece, with mythological elements to shake up the chaotic action-oriented combat, stealth segments, horseback riding, and some of the franchise’s best exploration. You can lose yourself in Odyssey’s game world for much longer than it takes to beat the story mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring">Elden Ring</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I have spent many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-beat-elden-ring-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of hours</a> exploring The Lands Between, and I’m still in Limgrave (not really!). Some players spend thousands of hours in the game. With the recent expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, you could play the latest Soulslike from developer From Software for months without fear of running out of new dungeons to delve into or bosses to shed a tear over.</p>



<p>The sheer build variety, open-world exploration, and borderline addicting combat make for a memorable experience that draws you back month after month.</p>



<p>If you intend to hop into the expansion, know that it’s exceptionally challenging, first and foremost. Secondly, we have a guide to help you with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC’s boss order</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-2">Nioh 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Koei Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you were excited to play Assassin’s Creed Shadows due to its Japanese setting, then Nioh 2 provides a similar world to lose yourself in, albeit one with far more yokai. The Soulslike, which combines elements of your favorite ARPGs, such as Diablo VI, proves to be one of the genre’s most satisfying yet niche titles. It’s a loot goblin’s heaven!</p>



<p>That said, it’s also the roughest recommendation I can offer. It’s a bit jank, a little complex where it doesn’t need to be, and relatively niche. But if you’re a fan of its setting, style, and challenging gameplay, you’ll find an RPG worth playing for hundreds of hours in the meantime!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-%E2%80%93-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay.994863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has officially announced a release date for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>. The upcoming reboot, which does away with the series’ traditional numbering, will transport players back to ancient China next year on January 17th, 2025.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher has also granted fans an in-depth look at Dynasty Warriors: Origins during TGS 2024, uploading a 23-minute gameplay preview with producer Tomohiko Sho that shows off a slew of exciting new features. You can watch in full here:</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - TGS2024 Gameplay Footage" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7yGIXY0AWFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A quick glimpse at Origins and you’ll realise that this isn’t some grand departure from the well-established Musou game template. “1 vs. 1,000” hack and slash combat is still very much the beating heart though developer Omega Force is looking to refresh its ageing battle system with some welcome tweaks and additions.</p>
<p>Battles strive for more of a cinematic feel, giving players more defensive and strategic options in between bouts of frenzied button bashing. As Origins’ nameless protagonist, you’ll be able to put ally grunts to use, activating tactical abilities to give you the upper hand.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll still spend most of your time cleaving through entire ranks of enemy soldiers, watching their lifeless rag-doll bodies flung across the screen. In doing so you’ll earn Bravery that can then be spent on unleashing Arts – special moves that change depending on which weapon you have equipped.</p>
<p>One change we’re particularly looking forward to is the increased threat from enemy officers. In Dynasty Warriors: Origins they’re looking more fearful, coated in a powerful aura that needs to be whittled down before you can finish them off. Some engagements will trigger duels that prompt all nearby troops to form an impromptu arena around the player and their opponent. The introduction of a parry move should also add a much-needed defensive layer to the Musou combat.</p>
<p>The last mainline game in Koei’s flagship franchise didn’t fare so well. 2018’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9</a> was meant to mark a radical change in direction that abandoned the conventional mission-based structure for a sprawling open world design. While it had some interesting ideas, the overall execution was poor and neglected a core part of Dynasty Warriors in need of improvement: its combat.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p>

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPbmb?object_uuid=1f93be51-736c-40e2-8606-6790c3773696&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a> has just recently been released with a launch price of $209.99 and you can only get it at Best Buy. That is $10 more than the cost of a standard Switch Lite, justified by the fact that a 12-month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership – which normally retails for $49 – is bundled with the console.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition (Best Buy Exclusive)</h2><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition Is Now Available</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><p>The Switch Lite Hyrule Edition was announced during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced">June 18 Nintendo Direct</a> alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. We originally saw it available <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk">overseas in the UK</a>, but Best Buy has exclusive rights here. </p><p>This particular edition is adorned in a gold colorway very similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-limited-edition-oled-nintendo-switch">Switch OLED Hyrule Edition</a>. It is a gorgeous metallic finish that looks even better than in the photos. Aside from the tiny Triforce logo, the front of the case is free from any busy embellishments. The rear sports a single large embossed Hyrule Crest. It's the best-looking Switch Lite so far.</p><h3>Differences between the Switch Lite, Switch, and Switch OLED</h3><p>The Switch Lite's major draw is that it's $100 less expensive than the Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It's compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. </p><p>The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite are that: 1) the controllers are not detachable, 2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV, and 3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). </p><p>If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third-party wireless Switch controller.</p><h3>What does the Switch Online membership offer?</h3><p>For many people, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Switch Online</a> is a necessary add-on for a complete Switch experience.

<p>Valve Corporation, tired of paying arbitration fees, has removed a mandatory arbitration clause from Steam's subscriber agreement. Valve told gamers in yesterday's update that they must sue the company in order to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement">subscriber agreement</a> includes "changes to how disputes and claims between you and Valve are resolved," Steam wrote in an email to users. "The updated dispute resolution provisions are in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">Section 10</a> and require all claims and disputes to proceed in court and not in arbitration. We've also removed the class action waiver and cost and fee-shifting provisions."</p>
<p>The Steam agreement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240807021027/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">previously said</a> that "you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration." Now, it says that any claims "shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Steam's email to users said the updated terms "will become effective immediately when you agree to it, including when you make most purchases, fund your Steam wallet, or otherwise accept it. Otherwise, the updated Steam Subscriber Agreement will become effective on November 1, 2024, unless you delete or discontinue use of your Steam account before then." Steam also pushed a <a href="https://x.com/401authrequired/status/1839501542770057414">pop-up message to gamers</a> asking them to agree to the new terms.</p>
<p>One likely factor in Valve's decision to abandon arbitration is mentioned in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.337957/gov.uscourts.wawd.337957.1.0.pdf">pending class-action lawsuit</a> over game prices that was filed last month in US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The Steam users who filed the suit previously "mounted a sustained and ultimately successful challenge to the enforceability of Valve's arbitration provision," their lawsuit said. "Specifically, the named Plaintiffs won binding decisions from arbitrators rendering Valve's arbitration provision unenforceable for both lack of notice and because it impermissibly seeks to bar public injunctive relief."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Mandatory arbitration clauses are generally seen as bad for consumers, who are deprived of the ability to seek compensation through individual or class-action lawsuits. But many Steam users were able to easily get money from Valve through arbitration, according to law firms that filed the arbitration cases over allegedly inflated game prices.</p>
<h2>Valve sued lawyers behind arbitration claims</h2>
<p>Valve used to prefer arbitration because few consumers brought claims and the process kept the company's legal costs low. But in October 2023, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826.1.3.pdf">Valve sued a law firm</a> in an attempt to stop it from submitting loads of arbitration claims on behalf of gamers.</p>
<p>Valve's suit complained that "unscrupulous lawyers" at law firm Zaiger, LLC presented a plan to a potential funder "to recruit 75,000 clients and threaten Valve with arbitration on behalf of those clients, thus exposing Valve to potentially millions of dollars of arbitration fees alone: 75,000 potential arbitrations times $3,000 in fees per arbitration is <em><strong>two hundred and twenty-five million dollars</strong></em>."</p>
<p>Valve said that Zaiger's "extortive plan" was to "offer a settlement slightly less than the [arbitration] charge—$2,900 per claim or so—attempting to induce a quick resolution."</p>
<p>"Zaiger targeted Valve and Steam users for its scheme precisely because the arbitration clause in the SSA [Steam Subscriber Agreement] is 'favorable' to Steam users in that Valve agrees to pay the fees and costs associated with arbitration," Valve said.</p>
<p>Zaiger has a "Steam Claims" <a href="https://www.steamclaims.com/">website</a> that says, "Tens of thousands of Steam users have engaged Zaiger LLC to hold Steam's owner, Valve, accountable for inflated prices of PC games." The website said that through arbitration, "many consumers get compensation offers without doing anything beyond completing the initial form." Another law firm called Mason LLP used a <a href="https://www.masonllp.com/case/valve-mass-arbitration/">similar strategy</a> to help gamers bring arbitration claims against Steam.</p>
<p>There hadn't previously been many arbitration cases against Steam, Valve's lawsuit against Zaiger said. "In the five years before Zaiger began threatening Valve, 2017 to 2022, there were only two instances where Valve and a Steam user could not resolve that user's issue before proceeding to arbitration. Both of those arbitrations were resolved in Valve's favor, and Valve paid all of the arbitrator fees and costs for both Valve and the impacted Steam user," Valve said.</p>
<p>Valve's lawsuit against Zaiger was dismissed without prejudice on August 20, 2024. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826/gov.uscourts.wawd.328826.29.0.pdf">ruling</a> in US District Court for the Western District of Washington said the case was dismissed because the court lacks jurisdiction over Zaiger.</p>

And those are just the skins my friends and I use.</p><p dir="ltr">In this way, Fortnite is as close to the online world imagined in Ready Player One as we have in real life. There's definitely something hilarious in watching Deadpool, Alien's Xenomorph, Geralt from The Witcher games, and Will Smith as Mike Lowrey from Bad Boys dance to NSYNC together. There's goofy, childish fun in random characters being mixed up and doing stupid things like forming a rock band or riding a cartoon train in between bouts of gunning each other down. It might be an incredibly one-note joke, but it's one that doesn't seem to get old.</p><p dir="ltr">But playing Fortnite always feels kind of gross for the same reason. It's a mosh pit of business interests--not a celebration of characters and stories so much as the gotta-catch-em-all collecting of Intellectual Property. As corporations come to own more and more media of all sorts, we see more and more of that Ready Player One blender of nonsensical appearances of various bits of pop culture, devoid of any real soul. Fortnite is a major offender but far from the only one.

Having Fry and Leela in Fortnite doesn't bring the spirit or creativity of Futurama into Fortnite; it just lets you purchase a few references from the show you like to see in the game you like. They're all stripped of meaning and stamped out as if from an assembly line.</p><p dir="ltr">Funny, then, that a game based on Funko Pop toys, which literally exist to squeeze characters from various properties into a single, easily reproducible form that can be stamped out on an assembly line, gives the strongest sense of the uniqueness this era of IP obsession could be good for, but isn't.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/funko-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-569178">Funko Fusion</a> is a third-person action game in which you play through a bunch of levels inspired by different IPs, not too different from something like the various Lego games licensing properties such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and The Incredibles. Though I'm not really a fan of Funkos generally (although I admit to owning several--but <em>mine </em>are the <em>cool</em> ones, like the wendigo from Hannibal, BT-7472 from Titanfall 2, and a voxel Xenomorph from Alien), I found myself really wanting to like the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/funko-fusion-review-pop-til-you-drop/1900-6418292/" data-ref-id="1900-6418292">despite it getting frustrating to play at times</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">What I find endearing about Funko Fusion, despite the fact that it too is in the business of smashing various properties together, is that Funko Fusion is weird.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko has seven major levels based on IP from Universal movies and TV shows, and only some of those feel normal to be in a video game, like Jurassic World, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Masters of the Universe. But several are interesting, unexpected pulls: Edgar Wright's '90s action movie send-up-slash-homage, Hot Fuzz; the Netflix series The Umbrella Academy; the TV series Battlestar Galactica from 1978; and John Carpenter's horror classic, The Thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375194" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375194"></a><figcaption>I gotta say, I never expected any sort of video game adaptation of the movie Nope.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375194-funkofusionnope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are also a bunch of secret levels and characters you can uncover, referencing all kinds of stuff. You can race against KITT, the talking car from the 1980s David Hasselhoff TV series Knight Rider; you can fight alongside Xena from Xena: Warrior Princess, Lucy Lawless's 1990s action show that spun off from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys; you can get attacked by serial killer-possessed doll Chucky from Child's Play and by M3GAN, the killer-robot doll from the eponymous movie. There are full levels based on Jaws, Shaun of the Dead, Jordan Peele's Nope, and the 1999 version of The Mummy. If you find enough collectibles, you can even unlock a playable Colonel Sanders--the guy from the fried chicken fast-food restaurant.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko Fusion represents a smattering of strange choices for things to bring into a video game, and for the most part, it renders them in pretty expansive detail. The Mummy level is full of puzzles and traps, culminating in a boss fight with Arnold Vosloo's fly-breathing version of the monster. There's a whole Back to the Future scene in Hill Valley where you have to put new tires on the DeLorean.</p><p dir="ltr">All this to say that it's the fact that Funko Fusion taps into IP that nobody is really tapping that intrigues me. It makes me nostalgic for another time: the 1990s, at the height of the Console Wars, during the fourth generation of gaming hardware. It was a time before corporations realized they could just jam a character from one thing into another thing, which would thus act as an ad for both, but would require little creativity.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the time of the tie-in video game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375211"></a><figcaption>I never once managed to land on the air craft carrier in Top Gun on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375211-topgun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you weren't alive or playing games during the 1990s, you might not really understand what I'm getting at. Tie-in games still exist, of course: There are those Lego games, Ubisoft put out a game adaptations of Star Wars this year and Avatar last year, and in 2023 I played games I really enjoyed based on movies I love--Aliens: Dark Descent, RoboCop: Rogue City, and Starship Troopers: Extermination. The Harry Potter people are currently trying to convince us that Quidditch is cool with a game tie-in. Movies and TV shows still get video games made about them.</p><p dir="ltr">But especially in the '90s and even into the early aughts, when it was much easier to make a game based on anything that seemed like it might remotely draw interest from kids, <em>everything</em> had a video game. There were games based on everything from Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd and Cliffhanger to Addams Family Values, Hook, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Casper, The Flintstones, Home Alone, Home Improvement--even the Robin Williams movie Toys and the Noid, a weird little guy they used to put in Domino's Pizza ads. Read through the Wikipedia list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_based_on_films#:~:text=Atari%20Games.%20Mindscape%20%5B29%5D%20Tengen.%20Indiana" rel="nofollow ">games based on movies</a> sometime, because the old ones get pretty wild.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, most of these were absolutely cynical cash-grabs, and many felt like it. But occasionally you'd get something like Enter the Matrix, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, Disney's Aladdin and The Lion King, Blade Runner, Cool Spot (featuring the mascot for 7-Up)--or GoldenEye. Most tie-in games were just platformers or Doom clones, coming off as low-effort and low-interest by the people who were making them. But sometimes, you could get something really exciting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375195" data-ratio="0.56181818181818" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375195"></a><figcaption>I still have my copy of Ghostbusters for NES and that game suuuucks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375195-ghostbustersnes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing is, the fact that Funko Fusion has an entire level based on the movie Nope is just cool for the execution, because the time when you could find such a wide range of movies and TV shows rendered as games has long since passed. Sure, Galactica's Cylons or Nicholas Angel from Hot Fuzz could make their way into Fortnite, but they'd just be weird versions of the characters made to do TikTok dances. Their value begins and ends at "Hey, I recognize that."</p><p dir="ltr">What I hope for Funko Fusion is that it might lead to more games like it--more projects tapping ignored licenses and actually delving into their stories, characters, and worlds, at least a little. I want more RoboCop: Rogue Citys, more Starship Troopers: Exterminations, more Aliens: The Dark Descents. I want more doofus adaptations of barely family-friendly comedies and Robin Williams movies nobody liked. I want something more than $10 skins that remind me of things I previously enjoyed.</p><p dir="ltr">If we're stuck living in a world where all media is corporate IP anyway, we should at least get some weird games out of it.</p>

I often fall into long stretches where I pick up and play a lot of games for varying periods of time, but never finish them. Thanks to the job, I just rarely have the time to linger on a thing for too long outside of a professional obligation. Fortunately, the last few games I’ve picked up have been just the right size, allowing me to see them through to the end and marvel at their construction and ingenuity. I’m now more convinced than ever that we need shorter games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,192610,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On the most basic level, shorter games just <em>feel</em> better. Or rather, <em>I</em> feel better at their conclusion. Games aren’t just experiences to be had, but also things to be beaten. Finishing a game is supposed to be a triumph, and it can often be that victorious feeling that carries me from one to the next. Even if a title lacks any real story, we have our own narrative arcs with them, complete with rising and falling actions, climaxes, and a conclusion, and that’s a satisfying rhythm to have with a game. Your impression of a movie, book, show, or album is colored by the time you spend with it and how thorough an experience it is. Therefore, it’s kind of incomplete if you never listen to that last song, or see the final shot of a film. Similarly, games that I don’t finish remain this kind of half-formed image in my head. Since most notable releases have ballooned in size and now require dozens of hours to complete—time which, in my life, is increasingly hard to come by—I’m finishing less and less of them, but there are now more barely formed impressions of them in my head than ever. You know what that all means? It means I’m playing less than ever before, and experiencing fewer fresh titles as a consequence, and it’s as frustrating as it sounds.</p><p>The run I’ve been on the last few weeks flies in the face of the industry’s poorly conceived notion that bigger is unilaterally better. It started when I was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">reviewing <em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, a 3D platformer that thankfully takes all of about a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-astro-bot-guide-1851642040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-astro-bot-guide-1851642040">dozen or so hours to beat</a></span> and see through to 100 percent completion. Soon after that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/plucky-squire-review-zelda-pc-playstation-xbox-switch-1851648226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/plucky-squire-review-zelda-pc-playstation-xbox-switch-1851648226"><em>The Plucky Squire</em></a></span><em> </em>was released, and I managed to beat that roughly 10-hour game across two back-to-back evenings. When I couldn’t sleep the other night, I booted up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a></span> and wrapped it within about three hours.</p><p>Even looking ahead at some of the games I’m excited to get to, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger</em></a></span><em> </em>sounds like a fantastic game that I can wrap up in a weekend and <em>Castaway </em>explicitly communicates how much of a bite-sized adventure it is. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308"><em>I Am Your Beast</em></a></span><em> </em>is a speedrunning first-person shooter styled like a comic book that is a few hours long, and <em>Arco </em>seems about as lengthy as most of the aforementioned titles. Look at what a wealth of different experiences I could potentially get around to without having to exhaustively give up whole days of my time.</p><p>I’m not just propping these games up due to their lengths, either. Each of the games that I’ve beaten over the last few weeks stands apart from the others, and they all feel like breaths of fresh air. <em>Astro Bot </em>is the feel-good, polished AAA 3D platformer that people have begged for, the kind that it seemed like only Nintendo and Sega were in the business of making anymore. <em>The Plucky Squire </em>is a loving homage to gaming’s past that’s perhaps <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126">a little <em>too</em> hands-on</a></span> with its guidance but frequently hops between genres and dimensions and sets you loose in its best moments. <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>sometimes feels more like a series of interactive comedy sketches stitched together than it does a fully-featured game, but it is also one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever played, and unlike anything I’ve picked up before it.</p><p>All three games feel like things that could only be made by smaller teams with clear visions that were unburdened by the industry’s tendency to fruitlessly chase trends. They eschew the previously outlined parameters of success, and yet I’d consider each one of them a resounding win. Crucially, none of them ever get stale or stagnant due to the premium bloat that is so commonly found in the lengthy blockbuster games often touted as the culture’s best work.</p><p>By comparison, many criticisms of a tentpole game like <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>found the game to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/god-of-war-ragnarok-cast-too-big&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/god-of-war-ragnarok-cast-too-big" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarkably, even distractingly, stuffed</a></span>. <em>Persona 5</em> felt like such a slog by the end that I had to shelf it for a month mere hours before its ending. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed both <em>The Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but eventually found myself dashing to the credits and forgoing the near-endless side content that either aimed to distract me with. This year’s <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221">bigger than it realistically should’ve been</a></span>, and its best moments are undermined by the inconsistent quality of its filler content, which is so frequently pushed to the forefront. There <em>is </em>such a thing as bang for your buck, but a lengthier experience with a game is not always a richer one. These games exhausted me, and their increasingly standardized framework feels like a prison for games and their developers. Only so many things can get made with such a specific and narrow vision before we start reproducing the same shit ad nauseam and it all risks becoming nothing more than slop. </p><p>The previously mentioned blockbusters are each great in their own right, but they are also all victims of the AAA inflation that leads to problems like scope creep, blown up timelines, rising budgets, and increased pressure from publishers and business partners to meet increasingly unrealistic expectations that promise returns from their huge investments. The idea that games need to be this big is a scam sold by marketers and executives who want to upsell you the same kinds of games over and over. These are the same people who birthed games-as-a-service to turn one-time purchases or installs into “forever” games squeezing you for your money for months, if not years, at a time. The same people who tried to trick you all into thinking they believed in <em>Concord </em>and then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">pulled it from physical and digital shelves within weeks</a></span>. These titles are victims of a failing system and vision for games.<br></p><p><em>Astro Bot, The Plucky Squire</em>, and <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, as well as other shorter games, aren’t the catch-all antidote to the industry’s ailments, but they sure do read like a damn fine blueprint for a possible future. There’s no good reason why these sensibly budgeted, mid-range, and creative titles should feel like outliers in this field. Even the safest of them, <em>Astro Bot</em>, feels like this bold experiment when it really shouldn’t. A family-centric platformer and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602">adorable brand icon</a></span> is a no-brainer on so many levels, but after a decade of pursuing prestige and mature audiences with increasingly bloated games and overly similar franchises, Sony breaking from its own tired formula reads as revolutionary when it’s just common sense.</p><p>I don’t want massive games to disappear. Sometimes, you need a three-hour epic of a film to rock your world and sensibilities, or a hefty tome of a novel to challenge you. I don’t know of a good double-album, but I’m sure there’s one out there that provides a sonic journey like no other, and similarly, there are worlds and stories in games that demand a certain size and investment to pay off. I just wrapped up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span><em> </em>after more than 80 hours, and I’ve been championing it as one of the best things I’ve ever played. I <em>just</em> want us to break free of the trap that the homogenized vision of the big game has become.</p><p>That’s why we <em>need </em>shorter games. Yeah, I selfishly feel better being able to complete these diverse, brilliant, and bite-sized experiences, but it also feels like a healthier move for everyone involved. It frees developers to make a different mold of game than what the industry has deemed acceptable for the last decade. Hell, it could begin to <em>save </em>the industry from the ballooning costs and increasingly common failures of the service games bubble that has clearly burst. It’s something else, and more than ever, that’s what video games need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Red Candle Games, the developer behind critically acclaimed horror titles Detention and Devotion, has announced its equally well-received Sekiro-inspired action-platfomer Nine Sols is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 26th November.
</p>
<p>
Nine Sols, which released on PC back in May following a successful crowdfunding campaign, casts players as the cat-like Yi, as he embarks on a quest of vengeance through a dark fantasy world, melding sci-fi and Eastern mythology. His goal is to eliminate the realm's formidable rulers - the nine Sols of the title - and unravel the mysteries of an alien race.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Nine Sols combines elements of a Metroidvania - insofar as it features a vast interconnected world, albeit one you'll largely be exploring in a linear fashion - and what Red Candle calls fast, brutal "Sekiro-lite" combat build around slashes and deflections. Oh, and it's also a lovely looking, gorgeously animated thing too.

<p>
Nine Sols (which I absolutely adored during my limited time with it earlier this year, and which has also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/">amassed an Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam if you're looking for a broader canvassing of opinion) will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch when it launches on 26th November.
</p>
<p>
And if you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate  subscriber, you might like to know Nine Sols is joining the service's game catalogue at the same time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-jacob-geller-ubisoft-assassins-creed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video essays are one of the few places you can go on YouTube to get substantial, well-researched commentary on a subject, as opposed to sensationalized yelling with a thumbnail where somebody looks like they just saw the face of God. But those video lengths sure do tend to balloon, don’t they? What’s going on there? One might be tempted to chalk it up to the YouTube algorithm, but this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a> guest, video essayist <a href="https://jacobgeller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>, has a different take.</p><p>Geller joins us ahead of his 24-hour stream to raise money for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jacobgeller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tune into here</a>. We discuss video game criticism in the age of drive-by culture wars on social media and conclude that – despite how bleak things might seem – there’s a growing hunger for meaningful criticism. We also learn about the ins and outs of creating heady essays on YouTube, specifically: Why do they keep getting longer? How do you write for a specific audience without becoming somebody who pre-reacts to every bad faith YouTube comment?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to this week’s big news: Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/456349/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-star-wars-outlaws-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a><em> </em>following weaker-than-expected sales of its<em> Star Wars</em> game. Amid all that, as well as an ongoing campaign against <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for featuring a Black samurai</a>, Ubisoft also decided to issue a statement about how its goal is “<a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1838973833014895088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to push any specific agenda</a>.” Grimacing emoji. Lastly, Christmas comes early for me and me alone, because the mailbag is chock full of questions about <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goku</a> and karaoke.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make the longest video essay yet: one that never truly ends.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Jacob:</strong> I think if you go back and watch my early videos, the sound quality sucks and the editing is worse, but they’re not very different from what I’m doing now. They’re pretty close. Something that seems to happen to every video essayist is, videos just get longer. It’s something I keep thinking about, because anyone who’s been doing this for a long time, if you look at the trajectory of their videos, they get longer. And I don’t think it is simply to do with YouTube rewarding longer videos. I think that is the case, and people have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Rogers’ six-hour [<em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>] video</a> getting a million views and have thought “I can do that.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I have never tried to do that. I have never thought “This video isn’t long enough for the algorithm; it needs to be longer.” And yet, the average span of my videos just has crept upwards over the years. And I think part of it is, at least for me, [that] having a larger audience makes me feel more on the hook for “I need to do due diligence about this.” I now read, in general, multiple books per essay. And the more you take in, the more you have to say on any subject.</p><p>I read – I have here – this book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Torture-Democracy-Darius-Rejali/dp/0691143331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Torture and Democracy</em> by Darius Rejali</a>. The worst month of my partner’s life was when I was reading this torture book and was like “Guess what I just read about!” She’d be like “Please don’t tell me.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>David Grossman, my beautiful husband that I love so much, he has this really interesting biography of Hitler that’s that size. He was reading it around when the war [in Gaza] started, and he put it on our coffee table. And every time we had people over, I’d be like “Baby, you’ve gotta move the giant Hitler book with Hitler’s face on it.”</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>Shaking his head the whole time…</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> So people know he doesn’t approve of the ideas.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He’s like “OK, what you’re saying is, I can’t have it on the coffee table, so I should take it on the subway and shake my head the whole time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jacob:</strong> My guess is that if he was writing an essay about Hitler before he read the book versus after, the after would be way longer because he would be like “Even if I’m still condensing down information, I still have a thousand more pages to condense down.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, you have that urge to be comprehensive. I struggle with this sometimes too, when I’ve reported out a big story and talked to a lot of people. When you become really intimately familiar with a subject, then it can feel, if you really condense it down – or if you omit a lot of information – like you’re somehow failing the people who are consuming your work and yourself and, if you talked to people, the people that you spoke to. How do you balance that with “There’s got to be a cutoff point to this. I can’t just put everything in here.” Where do you draw the line?</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>I think it’s easier with art than with journalism. I have talked to classes before and people who write about video games, and my advice is always: Do not tell me about a whole game – especially if your job is not just writing a review. Pick one interesting thing about a game and see how far you can go with that one interesting thing. Make it as small as you possibly can; get specific and dig in. That is such a better way of finding what a game is doing than being like “The graphics are good, and then the audio I don’t like as much. And then the gameplay,” etc. It’s too much.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons that my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eirR4FHY2YY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video on capital punishment</a> is specifically on execution methods and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiL3-CYzWk&amp;t=363s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video on torture</a> is specifically about <em>Call of Duty</em> torture scenes is an attempt to narrow the scope of those things. To be like “Can I make the framing of this small enough that then there are specific things I can talk about, but people will know this is not the definitive take on torture?” It’s just everything you could say about<em> Call of Duty</em> torture. Well, not everything – not even. A tenth of the things you could say about <em>Call of Duty</em> torture.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it’s really kind of being rigorous with yourself about “The thesis of this video cannot be ‘Everything you need to know about torture.’” What are the things you’re using to support it, and thus, what are your pieces of evidence that are most relevant to those things – and not just everything that could possibly be interesting about this?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s very, very real. Scope is the most important thing about criticism, I think, because you cannot possibly answer everyone’s question in the entire world. You just can’t. You only have your perspective that you can rely on. You can only speak from yourself. If you remember that, then it becomes easier to pare something down to the most essential parts, because you understand your own fallibility. We are all influenced by the things that have come before us and the society in which we live.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Coconut, coconut, coconut!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It’s a fucking coconut meme, right? But it’s true! I would not be the writer I am if my dad’s favorite class in college was not Anarchist Thought. There is a certain culture I was born into that shows me what my limitations are, what perspectives are native to me. It is difficult for me to think outside of that. So once you accept that you can’t please everyone, you can write something that is actually useful.</p><p><strong>Jacob: </strong>It is the YouTuber brain disease – and you can just see it happen in real time – of people forcing themselves to write into their scripts the objections that they can see coming from reading thousands and thousands of comments. And I can’t fault anyone for doing that because the human mind is not meant to read YouTube comments. If you’re going to read everyone take every sentence of what you’ve written in the worst-faith way possible, then you are consciously or not going to start adjusting your writing style to please the worst-faith readings of your work.&nbsp;</p><p>It just makes the writing broken, because for every claim you’re making, you have to say three things that are not the claim you’re making, and you have to make clear that you’re not saying those things. It really breaks up the flow of an argument. But I understand why people do it! I have that impulse too. I think “If I say this, people are going to think I’m saying that, so I have to make clear that I’m not.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pilot-quest-ufo-50-addictive-zelda-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started playing <em>UFO 50</em>, a game collection of 50 games meant to simulate a lost 8-bit game library, I felt I vaguely knew what I was in for. I assumed, wrongly, that it would simply be a series of retro throwback games that slowly unveiled themselves, that I would get addicted to a handful of them and call it a day. I did not reckon with game #44: <em>Pilot Quest Return to Zoldath</em>, which is brilliant and now consumes my every waking hour.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome back to Zoldath. Credit: Mossmouth.</figcaption></figure><p><em>UFO 50</em>’s fictional games are presented in chronological order, and <em>Pilot Quest </em>is far down the timeline. Having played the first six games, I decided to have my dessert first and picked it at random. In it, you play a little spaceman who has crash landed his ship on a planet and must repair his ship. You awaken in the middle of an alien town equipped with a yo-yo. In the middle of the town is a moon crystal that you can hit for moon shards. Moon shards are the game’s first level currency. Get enough shards and you can buy seeds from the Gumma Tree. Those seeds will ambiently produce shards in the background, turning the game into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cookie Clicker</em></a>-style game. In addition to this, you exchange shards for meat that slowly accumulates at the hunter’s lodge. Those slabs of meat can be given to the guard at the exit of town, who will let you out into the The Wild Zone, and that’s where the game gets interesting.</p><figure><figcaption>You gotta pay my man Slard if you wanna enter The Wild Zone. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>When I saw that <em>Pilot Quest</em> was an incremental game I was initially annoyed, because many of those games are simply skinner boxes that infinitely dose out rewards with seemingly no end or point. But the overworld element to <em>Pilot Quest</em> is implemented brilliantly. Each slab of meat adds to the time that you can spend outside, but it also acts as your health. If you want to take anything back to the town, you need to make it back alive. Take a few hits and you may run out of time. This means that the more time you risk out in the The Wild Zone, the more you gamble. As you get the parts of your ship back, you start to gain not just shards but also resources like ingots or science that can be harvested by fixing buildings in your town for your friends to live in and work on. In effect it is <em>Farmville </em>mixed with a meta town builder like&nbsp; <em>ActRaiser&nbsp;</em>or <em>Soul Blazer </em>mixed with <em>Zelda</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>You need to strengthen your base in order to survive longer in order to strengthen your base. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>What makes this game truly brilliant within the context of the collection is that, in the lore of<em> UFO 50</em>, <em>Pilot Quest </em>was the first game on the console to utilize the clock feature. This means that the game continues to collect resources as long as you are playing <em>UFO 50</em>. Like many incremental games, babysitting it yields diminishing returns. The game’s structure rewards you playing a little bit of it, quitting, playing a different game, and coming back later.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption> The history description of the game lets you know that the game actually mines resources while you're not actively playing it. Credit: Mossmouth</figcaption></figure><p>Despite being kind of mad at how addictive <em>Pilot Quest</em> is, it is<em> </em>one of the few incremental games that I respect. What it is doing in its place in the collection makes me want to play the other games more while constantly checking in ambiently between rounds of other games. I’m also glad that I played it early, and I would suggest you do too, because I am gaining more progress in it than if I had played it chronologically. It is a brilliant take on the form</p><p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some resources to farm.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's been officially confirmed that the class <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/">lawsuit against Sony</a> in the UK is set to go to trial on 2 March 2026. It's estimated that the trial will last for eight weeks in total. For those unaware of what this trial is about, Sony is being sued for the unlawful behavior of charging out-of-proportion prices on their digital content, including add-ons. This lawsuit has been created by Alex Neill, a person with nearly 20 years' worth of experience in consumer campaigns and trying to achieve change for UK consumers. Alex is a regular speaker at industry events regarding consumer issues and consumer rights across all sectors in the UK. She is the sole director of Alex Neill Class Representative, which is a not-for-profit special purpose vehicle that is being used for the specific purpose of pursuing claims against Sony.</p>
<p>While the trial may seem far away, Alex explains that the trial dates have been set considering the amount of time it takes each of the parties to share evidence and expert reports and prepare their cases. The court's availability also plays a role.</p>
<p><a href="https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This case</a> is based on the claim of those who owned a Sony PlayStation between 19 August 2016 and 19 August 2022 and those who did own one, purchased digital PlayStation games, or made in-game purchases via the PlayStation store. This class lawsuit is going ahead as the claimant believes that PlayStation is occupying a dominant position in relation to the digital distribution of PlayStation games and in-game content and, as such, has been charging UK customers too much for the content on their consoles. While Sony is entitled to make a profit with their products, the claimant is alleging that they are in breach of UK/EU competition law, as they have a "near monopoly" on the sale of digital games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sony has enforced strict terms and conditions on game developers and publishers, which allows Sony to set the price of digital games and charge a 30% commission on every purchase of digital games and in-game content. This leads to excessive and unfair prices for consumers. By having such high prices, the Class is alleging that customers have been paying too much, which has led to detrimental effects for consumers, including stifling competition, where the competition has to charge higher prices even to get an opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>With this class lawsuit, anyone can sign up as long as they are eligible. If the Class is successful in its lawsuit, it means that those who signed up may receive some compensation from Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>En Sabah Nur, known more commonly as Apocalypse, has finally made his chilling debut in <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>. As one of the most powerful and ancient mutants in Marvel Comics, Apocalypse has been a bane to the X-Men for decades. Now, <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em> players can bring this iconic villain to their tabletop battles. Atomic Mass Games sent along a review copy of Apocalypse, as well as several terrain sets tied to the character, for review - so follow along to hear my thoughts!</p>
<h2>Apocalypse Character Pack</h2>
<p>Let's start with the star of this show, Apocalypse. Also known as En Sabah Nur, he's been a long-time antagonist to the X-Men, with the goal of pushing the world to evolve through extreme crises! And though <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Apocalypse character pack</a> is the second most expensive single-character pack for the game at USD $69.99 (second only to <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/collections/crisis-protocol/products/marvel-crisis-protocol-dormammu">the $79.95 Dormammu miniature</a>), there's a lot of content in this little box o' Apocalypse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=AOMxjac- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-high-gloss-image.jpg?itok=_6NFJCX- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First, we should look at his stats and abilities, and I'll go over how I think he can best be used in a game of <em>MCP</em>. After that, I'll speak a bit to list creation with him, and how his specific list restrictions open up some really fun options for building a Four Horseman team!</p>
<p>First, his stats across the board are pretty strong - which you'd expect from one of Marvel's biggest baddies! With 4's in all his defense stats, and 7 HP, he's very sturdy. Add to that his special ability "Only The Strong Remain," which is always removing 1 Damage every time he's hurt, and you're looking at a very, very tough customer here. But here's another interesting aspect to this character: he's a size 4. That means that most things you throw at him (or throw him into) aren't going to hurt him much.</p>
<p>This, thematically, makes a lot of sense to me! It's hard to imagine Peter Parker doing much damage to Apocalypse by flinging a telephone pole at the guy, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For attacks, Apocalypse uses his ability to transform his body into weapons (the model kit comes with a few alternative build options for his arms, giving him saws or guns. I kept it classic, as I'm want to do in all my miniatures). This ability is shown in the Biomorphic Arsenal attack, his builder with a whopping 7 strength.</p>
<p>En Sabah Nur's Judgment, his second attack which keys nicely with his You Will Be Remade Through Me special ability, really wants you to be inflicting condition types on your opponents. But talk about someone who can dish out condition effects but can't take them - Apocalypse is immune to all conditions when you flip him over to his injured side. I can't think of any other model for the game that can do the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=HYVq4oI0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apocalypse-healthy-and-injured-cards.jpg?itok=4hrxNIK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So, how do you play Apocalypse? A lot of that comes down to really using him as the leader of the Servants of the Apocalypse affiliation. But just straight up as a 6 Threat miniature on the board, I could see him being very useful at eliminating threats and targeting your opponent's priority models. He doesn't have very good range, but get him in close and let him pummel your enemies, and you should be in good shape.</p>
<p>Now what's all this about his affiliation: Servants of the Apocalypse? This is, by far, the best way to utilize Apocalypse in your games of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. With this Affiliation, you'll assign Apocalypse the 'Master of the Horseman' card.</p>
<p>But who are the horsemen? When building a roster of 10 potential figures to bring to a match, you'll want to make sure those ten models are eligible to one of Apocalypse's Four Horseman. Atomic Mass Games has a handy chart to consult:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=EW_M7Ni3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/servants-of-the-apocalypse.jpeg?itok=Xg6bZLXB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When building your roster based on the Threat Level of the encounter, you'll squeeze as many horsemen from your roster in as possible, and each will be assigned their relevant card for whether they play the role of Death, Famine, Pestilence, or War.</p>
<p>Each of these cards offers useful - but not game-breaking - boosts, from dishing out damage to draining energy from nearby characters, and they all work towards helping Apocalypse evolve into more. And Apocalypse gains the powers of every horseman card on the field.</p>
<p>There are untold synergies here between the innate abilities of the characters you can use as your four horsemen, Apocalypse's ability to serve as a storage bank of energy for characters and fun interactions on the board. I have a feeling this could end up being very competitive, with lots of different iterations on the most potent combo of characters and abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=SA8pyRKE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/four-horseman-cards-marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse.jpg?itok=aHqTVTA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this is why, as I stated above, I think there's a lot of game packed into a single character pack, and bringing Apocalypse to the table opens up a lot of new play options for the inventive MCP player. But now let's talk about the new terrain sets that are coming out alongside Apocalypse (but sold separately).</p>
<h2>Dark Future Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>The Dark Future Terrain Pack starts our trend of bringing Apocalypse-adjacent terrain into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. Featuring an overall look that combines Ancient Egyptian construction and style with futuristic Celestial Technology, Dark Future is the first of three exciting new Terrain Packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=SKy3VNBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-future-terrain-pack-glossy.jpg?itok=RXa67fWJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This pack features 2 Regeneration Vat Miniatures, 2 Energy Syphon Miniatures, 4 Sacred Flame Miniatures, 4 Illuminated Crystal Miniatures, and - most importantly - two different One-Shot cards. First, the "Teleportation Network" reduces the overall threat value by -1, and allows players to teleport between Crystal Obelisk (Illuminated Crystal) pieces of terrain by interacting with them (Fun note: nothing in the rules says you can't destroy these obelisks and shut down the teleportation network).</p>
<p>The second One-Shot included in this is "Celestial Healing," which lets a character interact with a regeneration vat to remove 2 damage and 1 special condition at the cost of gaining the stagger special condition. Aside from these fun one-shots - and INCREDIBLE new addition - the miniatures themselves really do a nice job of getting the game away from the classic NYC-style terrain.</p>
<h2>Shrine To En Sabah Nur Terrain Pack</h2>
<p>This terrain pack consists of two small chest miniatures and one large, chunky Shrine To En Sabah Nur (remember, that's Apocalypse's real name) terrain piece. Solid and easy to construct, this model offers great cover and comes with a One-Shot that adds +2 to the Threat of a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=Yw4ELDAn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrine-to-en-sabah-nur-glossy.jpg?itok=8eM5ZxCH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That One-Shot, "Trial of Survival," allows characters overlapping with the miniature to gain a bit of the power of Apocalypse, copying his ability to remove 1 damage every time they take a hit.</p>
<h2>Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter</h2>
<p>Finally, there's the absolutely stunning Rejuvenation Chamber Ultimate Encounter. This huge terrain model, which at the time of this writing is still up for pre-order, features a massive Rejuvenation Chamber model. And it comes with a full Ultimate Encounter, "Survival of the Fittest."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=XZ9sRb8w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rejuvination-chamber-glossy-large.jpeg?itok=anPL90eV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This Encounter, for three players, sees two players serving as the Crisis Team, each bringing their own squards to battle. The other player takes on the role of Apocalypse (sold separately) and four minions. And while it's a little bit odd that this is for three players exactly (not a normal player count), the game is in desperate need of more multiplayer formats/scenarios!</p>
<p>In the Encounter, Apocalypse hibernates while his minions attempt to grow his power, and after a certain point in the game Apocalypse will emerge, ready to fight! Depending on how well his minions did, he'll enter with one of four different character cards based on his "Evolution Count."</p>
<p>We haven't had a chance to playtest this Ultimate Encounter yet, but reading through the rules it looks like a very fun asymmetrical PvP format, and there's even a sliding difficulty scale!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=O-R8Qjl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-apocalypse-miniature-closeup.jpg?itok=MXC2AjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Marvel Crisis Protocol </em>Apocalypse Miniature and Terrain - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is an absolutely astounding set of releases all tied around Apocalypse, and it just shows how much care and dedication the team puts into&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>. For such an iconic villain as Apocalypse, this is the kind of miniature and release schedule the fans deserve. And though it helps build out the board, you don't have to go all in on the (admittedly pricey) terrain to get the most out of your experience.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the game and are considering diving into Apocalypse, you'll be pleased to know the character is done justice by its interpolation in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Crisis Protocol</em>.</p>

                <p>Majima fans have been waiting years for the Mad Dog of Shimano to make his return as a main story character.

Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) studio has released a seven-minute announcement trailer of its newest title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/" data-ref-id="5000-644699">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> where Majima shines again, and this time as the sole protagonist. Even though RGG has been releasing full-length games almost yearly, even longtime fans probably weren't expecting another game so soon or predicting Majima to return as a protagonist and a pirate. Plus, Yakuza's beat-'em-up combat and the series' best minigame both return--this is shaping up to be a great game!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</p>
      </div>
<p>As we saw in the trailer released last weekend, the game takes place six months after the events in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" data-ref-id="5000-590944">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Majima wakes up on a beach with no memory of how he got there or even his name. He is approached by a young boy, Noah (and his pet "cat" that is definitely a tiger) who tells him they are on an island near Hawaii called "Rich Island," before the duo are quickly confronted by pirates. Majima then meets Noah's dad, Jason, and learns about Nele Island--a dumping ground for waste and pollution that Majima and the yakuza are somehow involved in.</p><p>To recover his memory and solve the Nele Island problem, Majima must travel between the different islands of Hawaii as well as a new area called Madlantis--a hideout for gang members and criminal organizations run by a new character, Queen Michelle. He then, in true Majima fashion, takes over a pirate ship as the new captain and sets sail to solve the mysteries of these dilemmas.</p><p>It wouldn't be a true RGG title without an absurd premise, and what could be more absurd than Majima waking up on an island with memory loss and immediately becoming a pirate? Majima has had a lifetime of odd jobs: from Cabaret owner to construction manager to harassing Kiryu under different disguises, so it only makes sense another bizarre occupation would come along eventually. He's already got the eye patch, so why not conquer the sea as well?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375254"></a><figcaption>Majima was built to be a pirate.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375254-ss_8352ef639c0c52b316547ef16a825f06c0b91e39.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Following the trailer release and the story reveal, I had lots of questions regarding the gameplay with a playable Majima again. Thankfully I got the opportunity to play a brief demo.</p><p>It seemed like the turn-based combat style would become the norm for Like a Dragon games, but Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii brings back the Yakuza series' original beat-'em-up roots, including the iconic Heat moves. This style of combat feels more natural for Majima, whose outrageous personality might have been stilted in turn-based combat. In the demo, we are introduced to two of Majima's fighting styles: his signature Mad Dog fighting style and the new, Pirate "Sea Dog" style.</p><p>Majima may be 60 years old now, but that doesn't stop him from dancing around his enemies as if he was on the streets of Kansai again. The combat is just as over-the-top and wild as players would expect, with an added feature to use jump attacks in battle. The Mad Dog style is a modernized version that feels like a dream combination of his styles from Yakuza 0, using both his fists and tanto as weapons. There is also a new ability that allows Majima to "clone" himself to create doppelgangers, which are useful for taking down large groups of enemies.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2142934615"

By seamlessly switching to this stance, Majima transforms into a pirate, which mirrors how the characters in the previous Like a Dragon games transform into their "jobs" during battle. Majima is equipped with two cutlasses, a flintlock pistol, and a wire hook as weapons, and can easily switch between them for fun combos. I can only imagine how ridiculous the Heat moves will be in this style and I'm looking forward to exploring it more.</p><p>RGG games are famous for their abundance of side content and minigames to enjoy outside of combat, so, of course, the first thing I did after the battle demo was head straight to the karaoke bar. There were only a few songs on the playlist--there are brand-new songs like "The Sun at 36.5 C," and a few returning songs from previous games such as "As Long as You're Happy." I'm sure more songs will be added later, but Majima fans will be happy to know that Yakuza Pirate brings back the crowd favorite "24 Hour Cinderella" with the same glowing, rollerblading goofball serenading us. This time, however, we see him rocking the outfit as a 60-year-old man. I can honestly say that brought a tear to my eye.</p><p>Like a Dragon: Yakuza Pirate also brings back one of my favorite minigames in the series: Dragon Kart. I only got to explore one racetrack, but it was really fun to race around Hawaii with new characters and experience some of the new items featured in the game. It felt a little janky and intense in some turns, so hopefully it will be more polished before the game's official release.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375252" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375252"></a><figcaption>Madlantis is an incredible sight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375252-ss_2b5d18defaba64dd173a9656683584a461ab444e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>I also got to briefly explore Madlantis. Similar to the secret cities of previous titles, the streets of Madlantis are filled with neon lights and illegal gambling. I was impressed by the design of the fake city; the added shipwreck and pirate themes to the area made it feel like a fantasy land for organized crime.</p><p>One of my favorite new additions was the grappling hook, which I could use around the city. In certain areas of the map, Majima can grapple himself onto higher platforms to collect treasure and discover new heights. I loved using the spider grab in Like a Dragon Gaiden so it's pretty cool to see this mechanic updated. It also provides access to new areas to explore in the familiar Hawaii map.</p><p>Although my preview was short-lived, I got to experience a number of exciting new features and I adored playing Majima again. Though the game is brand new, it felt nostalgic running around the streets as the Mad Dog and I'm sure old-school fans of Majima will feel the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375253"></a><figcaption>Majima continues to be the most ridiculous man ever.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4375253-ss_57384e54173bf628f97c6b1f8c47381e5c1d7439.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>I didn't get to explore the story much so I'll save my analysis on that for now, but it's been years since we've witnessed a more serious side of Majima and so I do have some wishes. I would love to see more soft moments with the character again. I really hope there will be some references to the side stories in Yakuza 0 and possibly some reunions with characters from previous Yakuza games. Maybe there will be some heartfelt moments with Kiryu too, or perhaps a run-in with a certain character that longtime fans know now resides overseas.</p><p>Whether the story will finally conclude the Mad Dog's saga or not, fans will be impressed with the new features Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii has to offer, which also finally scratches that itch for more Majima. The combat feels effortlessly fun, there seems to be a plethora of side content to explore, and, best of all, we can finally see the old Mad Dog shine once again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The inspiration for Nintendo’s new museum came, at least in part, from an ongoing irritation for Shigeru Miyamoto. At a certain point every year, the <em>Super Mario</em> creator does a presentation for the hundred or so new staff that have joined the company. It’s an attempt to explain the core of what makes Nintendo a creative force.&nbsp;</p><p>“I talk for two hours,” Miyamoto said during a roundtable interview ahead of the museum’s opening. “And after 20 years, I don’t want to do it anymore.”</p><p>The solution to that problem comes in the form of a two-story building that used to be a playing card manufacturing plant in Nintendo’s hometown of Kyoto. It opens on October 2nd, but visiting isn’t as simple as taking the train; tickets can only be reserved through <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/index.html">a random selection process</a>. If you do make it, though, you’ll be greeted with an experience that explores more than a century of the company’s history, dating back to 1889 when Nintendo got its start making hanafuda cards.</p><p>From the outside, the museum is nondescript, a bland gray structure that wouldn’t look out of place in an office block. (It’s not unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_development_teams#/media/File:Nintendo_Headquarters_-_panoramio.jpg">Nintendo’s central office,</a> also in Kyoto.) But the playfulness becomes more apparent the closer you get. You’re greeted by a series of warp pipes and floating blocks, complete with a mushroom (naturally), as you approach the entrance. Inside the door, there’s a quartet of colorful Toads, along with a framed copy of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shigeru_Miyamoto%27s_signature.svg">Miyamoto’s whimsical signature</a>.</p><p>The main floor has something of a theme park vibe. There are a handful of interactive exhibits, each meant to be a slightly modernized take on an older Nintendo product. Nintendo once made a batting machine, for instance, so you can head into quaint Japanese-style living rooms and knock balls around. There’s a version of a Game &amp; Watch platformer where you use your shadow to help a character cross perilous gaps and a shooting range where you can wield an NES Zapper to shoot virtual paintballs at classic <em>Super Mario</em> enemies. The most straightforward exhibit is simply a room filled with classic games, emulated through Switch Online. Also, there’s a love tester machine (another little-known early Nintendo product).</p><p>The floor’s highlight is arguably a room filled with massive classic controllers so big each requires two people to play. In order to get through <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>using an NES controller the size of a novelty check, one player controls movement with the D-pad, while the other handles running and jumping. If you want to fly in <em>Pilot Wings</em>, it takes two people to lift up the jumbo-sized Wii Remote and tilt it around to pilot a plane. These experiences are fun in the way you’d expect from Nintendo, especially as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">continues to refine its skills in designing physical spaces</a>. But I can’t say I learned much about the company from trying to use a huge N64 controller.</p><p>The actual history is located one story up. As you ride the escalator, you’ll hear a succession of bootup sequences from classic Nintendo consoles, queuing up a trek down memory lane. Here, the entire chronology of Nintendo is laid out in a sprawling series of products. There are those original playing cards with their beautiful floral imagery, of course, but also all kinds of products during what Nintendo retroactively calls its “age of exploration.” A quick glance shows a company trying lots of ideas to find what works: there are Disney-branded board games from the ’50s, and walkie-talkies and RC cars from the ’60s. The company made strollers and exercise bikes and camcorders and its own version of Twister.</p><p>Then, Nintendo got into arcade games and released its first series of home systems with the Color TV-Game, and the rest, as they say, is history. After that success, Nintendo largely stopped making things like Napoleon-themed board games (I did not make that up, it’s real) and firmly pivoted to video games. This is why the early part of Nintendo’s story is a relatively small part of the museum, though, since it’s the least-known part of the company’s history, this also left me wanting more. From there, it’s an impressively detailed collection spanning the hardware you know, from the Game &amp; Watch up to the Switch. Each section features all of the iterations of the hardware, various accessories, and a collection of the most notable (at least according to Nintendo) games that were released on it, displayed in their cases from various regions.</p><div><p>The company doesn’t skip over its failures</p></div><p>The space is filled with oddities. There’s the Panasonic Q, a version of the GameCube that could play DVDs; a pair of goggles for the original Famicom that added stereoscopic 3D to 8-bit games; and <em>Face Training</em>, a DS game that came with a camera so you could practice facial exercises. Some ideas felt ahead of their time (like the DS guide to the Louvre), while others were always a bad idea (like the classically cringe “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/18ezo0x/keep_it_in_your_pants/">keep it in your pants</a>” ad for the Game Boy Pocket). As someone who has played Nintendo games since the NES, there were plenty of things I had never heard of, particularly when it comes to the company’s earliest days. Even Miyamoto learned some things. He joined the company in 1977 but had never seen a Copilas — a line of printers Nintendo made during the ’70s — in the flesh. “Those were something that I had only heard about,” he says.</p><p>I also appreciate that the company doesn’t skip over its failures. There’s a section dedicated to the Virtual Boy — attendees can stick their face into a wall-mounted headset to get the full black-and-red 3D experience — and the Wii U area is as big as the other console exhibits. There’s even a small space for mobile games like <em>Super Mario Run</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225944/nintendo-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mobile-ending-date">which no longer seem to be much of a priority</a>.</p><p>What’s missing is context. Each section has a few small tidbits of information, like the technology Nintendo was utilizing at the time or the initial goal of a new piece of hardware. You can see that <em>F-Zero</em> pushed the limits of the SNES with its pseudo-3D graphics or hear the enhanced sound that gave <em>Super Mario World</em> such memorable tunes. These are interesting on a surface level, but aside from laying things out chronologically, Nintendo otherwise leaves it up to visitors to connect the dots.</p><p>This open-ended nature makes it easier to explore at your own pace, but it also leaves out all kinds of important information. The descriptive labels found at a typical museum, with some brief details on each artwork, would’ve been very welcome here. Instead, the objects here mostly speak for themselves. There’s no indication of the cultural impact of any of the products; one section focused on Mario has copies of both <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. movies on DVD&nbsp;sitting in a corner, with no explanation. You wouldn’t know <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">one was a historic flop</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">the other a massive hit</a>.</p><p>Even worse, there’s no mention at all of who made any of these important works. Aside from Miyamoto’s signature at the front door, I didn’t see a single developer named anywhere in the museum. It’s a shame because the company is home to some of the most iconic and long-tenured creators in the field. Not just Miyamoto, but also the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18759918/super-mario-maker-2-nintendo-switch-takashi-tezuka-interview">Takashi Tezuka</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16213402/nintendo-yoshiaki-koizumi-super-mario-odyssey-interview-gamescom-2017">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">Shiro Mouri</a> of <em>Super Mario</em> fame; <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi</a>; <em>Animal Crossing</em> director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188006/animal-crossing-new-horizons-design-interview-aya-kyogoku-hisashi-nogami">Aya Kyogoku</a>; and longtime <em>Kirby</em> developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo">Shinya Kumazaki and Tatsuya Kamiyama</a>. It’s hard to imagine many people know Nintendo’s history better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch"><em>Smash Bros.</em> boss Masahiro Sakurai</a>. And yet, you wouldn’t know any of those people had a hand in these influential games at all from visiting the museum.</p><div><p>The objects mostly speak for themselves</p></div><p>This is by design, as Nintendo touts itself as a product-first company. With the exception of Miyamoto, its creative talent isn’t given much publicity. And it likely won’t be an issue for the initial superfans who will be attending and who will already know much of that context. But it makes for an odd museum-going experience, one that provides no real sense of how these games came to be and the decisions — and people — who shaped them.</p><p>That said, there is a small and incredibly fascinating section of old hardware prototypes tucked away on the second floor — including an early Wii U concept with two Wii Remotes stuck to either side of a tablet — which gives a glimpse into what the museum could be like if Nintendo opened up a little more and showed more than finished, successful products. Miyamoto hinted that he’d like to add more similar features to the museum in the future. “When I put myself in the consumer’s perspective, I kind of want to see behind the curtains a little bit,” he says. We already know these rare views behind the curtain can be enlightening, like when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14781038/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-8-bit-prototype-gdc-2017">Nintendo revealed the original 8-bit prototype for <em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>.</p><p>That’s not the main goal of the museum, however. Instead, it’s about showing Nintendo’s vision of itself to the outside world, much as Miyamoto does for new employees each year. That’s especially important right now as the company reaches a critical junction in its history. It’s one that will be marked not only by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a pivotal console transition</a> but also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">a continued push into new areas outside of video games, like theme parks and movies</a>. The bigger Nintendo gets, the more carefully curated its image seems to become.</p><p>“We thought that this museum is a great opportunity for both our employees as well as the fans to reconfirm what kind of company Nintendo is,” Miyamoto explained. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company. But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Museum is a showcase of that image at a time when Nintendo is arguably at the height of its powers — but it does so without delving into any of the messy, human work that got the company to this point.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Once a cheater is transformed into a frog, all the can do is hop around helplessly while the other team shoots the crap out of them. It’s very similar to when Cloud and company get turned into frogs in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. Fortunately, it’s not a requirement. Anyone fed up or who just wants to move on a start a new match that will actually count can decline to humiliate would be cheaters this way. I’m not sure if there’s a voting system where all the players on a team get a say, which would also be funny. It’s a 6v6 game so who knows how the tie-breaker would get figured out. </p><p>In the meantime, Deadlock still doesn’t have a timeline for a full release or even an official open beta. I’ve been fortunate to play a little myself and it’s a lot of fun, though it definitely caters a bit to number-crunching RPG nerds. The <em>Dota 2 </em>influence is inescapable, from the creep waves to the upgrade progression, but it’s one of the better 3D MOBA shooters I’ve come across. We’ll see how it evolves as Valve continues testing what could be it’s next big breakout multiplayer success story. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kojima has signed with talent agency WME, which the publication describes as his "his liaison in the world of TV and film."</p><p>He also went into detail about the future of Kojima Productions, breaking down his plan into three phases. The first phase, Kojima said, was all about Death Stranding and establishing it "within the games category and expand on global platforms, like Apple and PC and Sony." "This part is not necessarily difficult," he added.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/gettyimages-2153433780-1727459462458.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hideo Kojima is looking to Hollywood for some of his next moves. (Image credit: John Phillips/Getty Images for Warner Bros. Pictures)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Part of that, of course, is the upcoming Death Stranding sequel, which is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-revealed-in-extended-trailer-state-of-play-2024">set to release sometime next year</a>. But the second phase, Kojima revealed, involves "different forms of media: movies, anime, TV dramas, etc."</p><p>"Basically, expanding the game IP to other media," he continued. "That’s the second phase. That’s what we’re aiming for next. I created Kojima Productions under the scope of 'digital entertainment,' but I don’t think it necessarily has to be a video game. We could create a new IP from a game, or an anime, or a film, or something totally different. Anything is possible, and that’s the third phase."</p><p>That third phase certainly sounds a little more vague, but Kojima added that he "would like to work with talented people from around the world and create something new, with 'digital' being the keyword."</p><p>"It could be a movie, a game, or something else entirely," he continued. "I can’t die until then! I don’t think I’m trying to do anything too out of the ordinary!"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I created Kojima Productions under the scope of 'digital entertainment,' but I don’t think it necessarily has to be a video game."</p></div><p>Variety also asked for an update on the Death Stranding movie, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions">was announced late last year</a> with A24 and Kojima Productions, but Kojima didn't reveal too much. He did confirm, however, that he won't be directing it himself, although he will "supervise the plot and help them make it." </p><p>As for who might direct it, Jordan Peele seems like an obvious candidate, given his and Kojima's partnership on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-officially-reveals-od-project-with-xbox-studios-and-jordan-peele-game-awards-2023">mysterious upcoming game OD</a>. But Kojima pointed out that he has close relationships with other big filmmakers as well, including Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn, and George Miller, "and we always talk about doing something together."</p><p>"Right now, movies and games are two different branches, but pretty soon, it will be very similar," he continued. "So, it’s not about making a video game out of Nope or having Jordan adapt Death Stranding into a film. It’s about making something new together."</p><p>He also revealed that there "are several Death Stranding adaptation projects currently underway, but there is a different story I’ve written that’s intended for a movie. But I don’t have the time to direct it, so I won’t. Which is kind of like a test for the third phase."</p><p>Regardless, it looks like there's a lot more entertainment to come from Kojima in the future — whether it's in video games, the big screen, or anywhere in between. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: John Phillips/Getty Images for Warner Bros.

                <p dir="ltr">More than any other game company, Nintendo loves to play with its history. Just look at how many times the NES library has reappeared across virtually every console era--remakes in Super Mario All-Stars, re-releases on Game Boy Advance, playable titles in Animal Crossing, the Wii Virtual Console, NES Remix on Wii U, and NES World Championships on Switch. Characters like Pauline from Donkey Kong can disappear in the mid-'80s and suddenly reappear decades later. And for a quarter of a decade, the Super Smash Bros. series has essentially served as a digital museum of Nintendo's most iconic characters, worlds, and franchises. Given this fascination with its own history, it's surprising that it took this long for Nintendo to produce a physical museum. A week before its October 2 opening, I had a chance to spend two days at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto. As a lifelong fan of the company who credits it with my early fascination with gaming, it was a tremendous and surprisingly personal experience that I won't forget.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's first-party titles have always been filled with a certain polish that can feel like magic at times, so it should serve as no surprise that the company's obsessive attention to detail translates to a physical space. As you enter the main building (well, after you pass the line of five Toads who sing if you bonk their heads around), you're ushered into a holding area before the escalator to the exhibit space. In this dimly lit room, silhouettes of various Nintendo consoles light up in sync with the sounds of their startup chimes. From there you step onto the escalator and are greeted with ambient console-menu music as you're ushered upstairs. The first visible element of the exhibit room is a scoreboard-style box hanging from the ceiling with screens on each side. It displays startup screens of various consoles such as the iconic GameCube intro. It's very cool to see the entrance to the museum replicate the feeling of turning on a Nintendo console, from the chime to the logo animation to the menu music.</p><p dir="ltr">As you reach the top of the escalator, you suddenly emerge in the center of 360 degrees of Nintendo's history. It's almost overwhelming to go from a dark room and escalator to a panorama of sights and sounds from Nintendo. Game displays, massive controllers, and dozens of screens surrounded me as I entered the space, and I found myself randomly walking to the left to look at my first display. It was for the Nintendo DS, and I spent a couple of minutes taking in a wall of game boxes before I decided that I needed to have an attack plan for the exhibits or I was bound to miss something.</p><p dir="ltr">I decided to go chronologically, starting from a display that showcases Nintendo's early history with toys and licensed products. My time with Nintendo began when I was four years old in 1988, and I was only vaguely aware of the company's history of making hanafuda cards and toys. It was surreal to see Disney products and Twister boxes with Nintendo's logo on them. As a huge WarioWare fan, I was delighted to learn about and see products that I had previously only known as goofy minigame elements--the cowboy that you shoot over, the Ultra Hand grabber toy, and the Ultra Machine baseball launcher, among others. Thanks to one particular item on the wall, I learned that the random old Love Tester that I've directed my Pikmin to carry back to Olimar's ship wasn't random at all.</p><p dir="ltr">After a few walls of toys, board games, and old commercials, Nintendo's pivot to video games is presented via a case filled with Game &amp; Watch devices. I primarily know of Game &amp; Watch via Smash Bros. and minigames in WarioWare and the Game Boy Camera, so it was cool to see the wide variety on display.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374958" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374958"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong on Famicom at the Nintendo Museum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374958-interactive-exhibit_nintendo-classicslarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I entered the NES display and immediately felt my brain shift from, "Oh that's interesting, I haven't seen this before" to a flood of personal memories with dozens of games on the wall. Each console display has an inward-facing wall featuring a massive collection of games with their various North American, European, and Japanese boxes next to each other for the sake of comparison. You've probably seen examples of Kirby getting pissed off whenever he leaves Japan, and there are numerous examples of that in the museum.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who grew up playing games is sure to get a blast of nostalgia when they encounter so many titles from their past, but this hit was especially potent for me and my collector brain. I've spent so much time looking at cardboard boxes of games on eBay and analyzing creases, tears, sticker residue, water and sun damage, and names written in Sharpie. I occasionally encounter cardboard boxes of NES, SNES, Game Boy, GBA, and N64 games in good condition, but I have never seen boxes as pristine as these. With very few exceptions, every single box looks like it would have when you tore open the gift wrapping on a Christmas in 1988, 1991, 1996, or anywhere in between. The cherry on top? I asked a Nintendo rep if all of these games were CIB (complete in box), and he confirmed they were. It's hard to imagine a more flawlessly preserved collection of video games anywhere in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">These game displays take up a large percentage of the exhibit room, and their corresponding console is immediately identifiable thanks to the massive controllers that loom over every display. I spent a not-insignificant amount of time standing under these and staring straight up, marveling at the accuracy of these controllers' appearance and texture. It's seriously like someone took the machine from Honey, I Blew Up The Kid and pointed it at a pile of GameCube controllers and Wii Remotes, among others.</p><p dir="ltr">Above each game display are numerous screens that showcase gameplay from that console's titles. If the wall of dozens of Super Nintendo games isn't enough of a nostalgia hit, just glance up and you'll see Donkey Kong riding a minecart, Mario flying with his cape, and Star Fox battling a boss. One of the cooler AV features throughout the museum is the use of directional audio. When you're standing under one screen, you'll be hearing and seeing Uniracers gameplay. Take a step or two to the left and suddenly you're hearing and seeing Super Metroid. There are so many sources of audio in this room, but it never feels like chaos. Appropriate audio plays depending on what you're looking at, and if you're closer to the center of the room, it fades away so it doesn't feel like you're in a loud, blaring arcade. Of course, classic Nintendo tracks serve as the background music, so you might be listening to the soothing sounds of Delfino Island during your bathroom visit.</p><p dir="ltr">While the inside-facing walls of the console displays focus on the games, the outward-facing sides focus on the hardware, innovations, and features. Do you want to look at almost 30 Game Boy Advance SP variants in one place, including the one with the ad where Mario got a tribal tattoo? Boy, have I got the place for you. There's also a box filled with every transparent "Funtastic" variant of the Nintendo 64 that had me daydreaming about pulling off my own Ocean's Eleven heist. Most of these displays feature fairly common items, but I learned about the Super Game Boy 2--which only released in Japan--saw my first in-person 64DD, and was made aware of a wild peripheral that allowed people to <em>trade stocks online on the original Famicom</em>. Sadly, there was no shrine to the WaveBird to be found.</p><p dir="ltr">The museum overall is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum. Most of this information is relegated to these outer-facing walls, with details about sales, franchises that debuted on that console, and particular hooks like the N64 featuring four controller ports or the Gamecube having a network adapter that supposedly let you play Double Dash online, despite me never knowing a single person that has ever successfully done that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374959" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374959"></a><figcaption>The GBA display</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374959-exhibition-building-2_second-floor-exhibit_05large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A clever display involves eight adjacent screens, organized from left to right to represent Nintendo's consoles chronologically from NES to Switch. They're synced on a cycle to show how the big first-party franchises evolved over time, meaning you'll see Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, and so on simultaneously. In another example of Nintendo's great attention to detail, not only does it sync the various games, it also syncs the specific gameplay moments. It's wild to see eight simultaneous depictions of Link retrieving the Master Sword or eight versions of Rainbow Road at the same time. Longtime fans are well aware of how games have evolved visually over the decades, but it's really impressive to see it laid out so cleanly.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the details that Nintendo has included are almost impossible to notice if you don't know what you're looking for. One wall is a collection of game and console manuals (organized chronologically like most things at the museum), and the wall behind them looks like a subtle wave design of sorts. But it's more than an aesthetic; it's actually an unlabeled graph that tracks the number of products that Nintendo was shipping at that point on the timeline. This is depicted by stacked lines up until the mid-2010s or so, where the lines start being replaced by dots. Before long, there are no more lines and only dots. That's because the stacked lines represent paper manuals, and the dots are products shipped once physical manuals went by the wayside. Nowhere is this spelled out or labeled. It's just another little detail that Nintendo crammed into this space. And speaking of hidden little details, I spotted more than one sneaky Pikmin hanging around the museum as well.</p><p dir="ltr">One corner of the exhibition room is dedicated to specific franchises. Mario is the biggest display, with his games assembled in bunches that correspond to his platformers, sports games, parties, and kart racers. In a decision that shocked me, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was actually included in the display for the Yoshi series rather than among its mainline Mario series brethren. It's a glaring mistake and one that I need to bug my Nintendo contacts about until it's rectified.</p><p dir="ltr">This Mario display is in the back corner of the exhibit room, and in the lower corner of this display sits a little collection dedicated to Mario's movies. There are a few items from last year's tremendously successful movie, but I had to laugh when I noticed the DVD of the 1993 movie tucked away in the farthest corner of the farthest display. If it got any farther away from the center of the room, it would be outside in the courtyard.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the back corners, another one is labeled "Storage" but still features several interesting prototypes on display. Nintendo clearly went through a lot of ideas for the original DS design before landing on the final product, which must also be the case with the early Wii Remote prototype that looks like a Frisbee with a star in the middle of it. One of my personal favorite items at the museum is a pristine Ultra 64 (the original name of the Nintendo 64) along with its controller. I saw so many mockups and pictures of that thing in EGM and Game Informer growing up, and never thought I'd get the chance to see one in person.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm sure this all sounds like a lot to be located in just one exhibit room, and it's incredible to see how densely packed with gaming history it is. I certainly haven't listed everything, either. There's the display of fitness devices and games, a timeline of the evolution of the question mark block, the look at Nintendo's history of experimenting with stereoscopic 3D, and plenty more.</p><p dir="ltr">That's the second floor. The first floor mostly consists of interactive activities that are tied to various Nintendo products and the company's history. It's basically a collection of real-life minigames. Numerous rooms resembling batting cages are set up, but with the aesthetic of various rooms in a retro-themed house. It's meant to replicate how owners of the Ultra Machine--a Nintendo-produced pitching toy--likely interacted with it in the '60s and '70s. Each room is different, and I tried most of them, as hitting various objects with the balls triggers different effects. I knocked down shelves in the kitchen, started Mario tracks on a record player, and made bottles rotate so they said L-U-I-G-I instead of M-A-R-I-O. At the end of your 20 pitches, a screen asks you to grab a little broom and sweep the balls towards the front of the room, which I found oddly satisfying for some reason.</p><p dir="ltr">My favorite room was the one with the giant controllers. Miyamoto went wild with the Honey, I Blew Up The Kid machine in this room, featuring fully functioning giant replicas of the Famicom controller, N64 controller, Wii Remotes, and SNES controller. I played with all of them, and I had to laugh at the absurdity of attempting Super Mario Bros. speedrun strats on a controller the size of my front door. All of the controllers look and feel amazing, but the N64 was my favorite by a long shot. Using a massive analog stick to try to grab Bowser's tail is a blast, and I love that the Z trigger was activated by stomping on a little pedal on the ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374961" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374961"></a><figcaption>The Super Scope game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374961-interactive-exhibit_zapper-%26-scope-sp_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger spaces is filled with Super Scopes, NES Zappers, and a giant screen. Visitors can compete in a shooting-gallery game in which you're able to aim impressively far across the room to hit another player's targets. There's a novelty to playing on a screen this big and with a Super Scope, but I found the game itself to be a little too reminiscent of a mediocre minigame from the Wii era.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of these interactive experiences are directly tied to the company's history. You'll use an Ultra Hand replica to grab balls from a conveyor belt, walk on a screen as you match cards with Japanese poetry on them, test your love connection with a fellow visitor via a version of Nintendo's Love Tester machine, and control huge Game &amp; Watch minigames with your shadow. One room is filled with basic kiosks that allow you to play from a library that's essentially the Nintendo Switch Online collection.</p><p dir="ltr">Everything on the first floor is played by scanning your museum pass, which is loaded with 10 coins upon entry. These experiences range between one coin for smaller exhibits like the kiosk games, two coins for the batting cages and big controllers, and four coins for the shooting gallery. It seems like visitors will have to really pick and choose what to play on the first floor, especially if they're with their families. It's not like you can just pay two coins and go into the big controller room and go nuts. Each short session with a big controller costs two coins per person and per game. So if you and a friend want to team up to beat Agahnim in Link to the Past, collect 50 coins in Super Mario 64, and get to the flagpole in Super Mario Bros., that's six of your Nintendo Museum coins right there.</p><p dir="ltr">Two interactive experiences take place in a separate building, which sits across a small courtyard. There, visitors can paint their own hanafuda cards with an easy-to-follow kit. This room has a very "elementary school art class" feel to it, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. It was a pleasant, low-key way to start my visit before I got bombarded with Nintendo's gaming history. In a nearby area, a second hanafuda activity involves playing a tutorialized version of the card game against another player. It's done with some really clever tech involving projectors and cameras that can identify what physical cards are being placed and suggest what to play next. Neither I nor my opponent had the slightest clue how to play prior to this, and by the time we left the room, we felt like we had learned the general flow of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Downstairs from the hanafuda activities is Hatena Burger, the museum's food offering. Considering how remarkable most of the museum is, I found this to be a fairly standard burger place. I'm glad there's some sort of non-vending machine food at the location, but it felt more like a utility than a standout part of the museum. The fries came in the form of little balls instead of normal fry style, which is cool, I guess. But maybe they're not even fries at that point; maybe they're just potatoes. Look, I'm not a chef.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374963" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374963"></a><figcaption>The Nintendo Museum store</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374963-shop_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It should come as no surprise that there is a substantial gift shop at the museum. It also came as no surprise to me that I wound up getting way more than was reasonable or even feasible to bring back to Minnesota. But listen: This place sells huge Nintendo 64 controller pillows, and that alone made it worth it to scramble to buy new luggage at Don Quixote so I could get it on a plane. There are sections for every Nintendo console, and they all have variations on coffee mugs, pens, pins, shirts, sticker sets, and more. It's got to be the only place in the world with walls full of Virtual Boy and Wii U merchandise.</p><p dir="ltr">I left with two giant bags of merchandise, realizing that I'm probably the prime demographic for this museum. I'm a 40-year-old man whose earliest memory is playing Super Mario Bros., and virtually every single display was filled with items that I had personal memories of and fondness for. I'm also more than willing to spend too much money on a pillow that looks like a N64 controller. If that also describes you, you're definitely going to have a great time at the museum. Once it's open, I'm curious to hear reports from more casual gamers, younger fans, and people who brought families. My experience will not be the same one that the public will get once October 2 rolls around. I had infinite coins and could experience all the activities without any lines. It was easy for me to hop into one of those batting cages and have a fun time, but I wonder how I'd feel if I had to wait in a line and spend a fifth of my allotted coins on that experience. It could also be hard to get in for a while (tickets are currently distributed via a lottery system), and the museum is not exactly located in an easy-to-access, tourist-friendly spot. I'm confident that hardcore Nintendo fans will be thrilled with what the museum offers and that the journey will be worth it, but I can't speak for others who aren't as immersed in the company's gaming history as myself.</p><p dir="ltr">What you get out of the museum will likely depend on what you bring into it. It feels personal in a way I've never really experienced at other museums. Sure, I can walk around the Met in New York City and be fascinated by the historical artifacts and artwork, but ultimately those don't evoke any personal memories of my life. When I walked around the Nintendo Museum, I couldn't help but timestamp all of these exhibits alongside my own experience with them. It took me back to thinking my babysitter was the coolest person in the world because I watched her beat World 8-4 long before I could. Then I moved on to the SNES section and remembered my dad rushing home during his lunch break because that would give us enough time to play a Super Mario Kart grand prix together before he went back to the store. I remembered countless Mario Party battles between me and my sisters and whatever unfortunate friend or family member who got roped in against us. I looked at the GameCube display and remembered how many friends I met during raucous Double Dash and Smash Bros. Melee sessions in my dorm room. The huge Wii Remote reminded me of how my grandpa never understood video games enough to play with me, but in the later period of his life, we'd play Wii Sports bowling together in his nursing home. Even an exhibit as recent as the Switch brought me back to when my dog Razor was a little puppy sleeping in my lap during 15-hour marathons of Breath of the Wild (a game that itself made me feel like a kid again). For me, these displays and exhibits were far more than simple assortments of video game boxes in shockingly good condition. They were a reminder of so many great memories in my life, and a reminder of why I love games and pursued them as a career. In talking to numerous other attendees at the event, I know that I wasn't alone in this feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't expect every visitor to the Nintendo Museum to be as affected by it as I was. But I suspect that if someone is interested enough to take the journey to Kyoto to visit it, they're likely enough of a Nintendo fan to find many things to love about it. And for those lifelong fans like me, it can be a truly touching experience unlike any other museum. It's an amazing look at a company that, despite its eccentricities and occasional missteps, has had a clear design philosophy, confidence, and focus on fun that dates back decades before Mario jumped over his first barrel.</p>
