			<p>No game world has quite the same effect on me as Capcom’s Monster Hunter. Sure, it’s a fairly dangerous sort of place, with ecosystems that are forever going wrong, expeditions that never return, and the sort of native fauna that may or may not choose to use you as a snack, but hey, we’re not hitting a home run in the real world either. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monser-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is the latest journey to this world, and the third in the turn-based RPG Monster Hunter Stories spin-off, and it’s doing what all good sequels do: going bigger.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3 bears plenty of the hallmarks of its predecessors, from the turn-based combat through to the Monsties you and your companions ride on, but it’s offering a more mature story, a wider cast of monsters, and a bigger world for you to sink your teeth into.</p>


<p>One thing that’s clear from the start is that Stories 3 immediately puputstting up more of a fight than the previous Stories games. Whether you’re roaming the open zone areas, or hunting for monster eggs in monster nests, previous titles were pretty easy going in terms of combat, but Capcom have leaned into the more mature tone with a level of challenge that matches it.</p>
<p>If you hang out in monster nests for too long, a higher-powered variant turns up, and if you choose to fight it, you’re really going to have to grind out the win. I found myself against a particularly tough Gypceros after only thirty minutes or so with the game, while I was still grappling to remember just how Stories 3 combat worked. It nearly had me – death does, at least, only send you back to the closest settlement – but my team were victorious, and that brought the sense of elation that Monster Hunter should give you (and which Wilds somewhat fumbled at launch).</p>


<p>There’s a lot going on in Stories 3 combat. It’s built upon a returning structure, with the basis being a rock-paper-scissors-like system with Power, Speed and Technique attacks, with each being more powerful than one of the others. You’re rewarded for learning monsters’ attack types, and just like in the mainline series, these are changed up by the monster becoming enraged or, in some cases, infected, turning them into Feral variants that you have to approach in a completely different way.</p>
<p>That sense of challenge and a more mature outlook run through the opening hours of Stories 3. You’re a prince of the Azuria kingdom, and, in turn, the Captain of the Rangers, a group of monster riders who study the local ecosystem and hope to raise and protect monsters rather than hunt them.</p>
<p>The opening of the game sees you exploring the area, where you’re introduced to the appearance of egg quartz, a crystalline substance that traps monsters within it. In fact, monsters are in decline, and certain species are affected more than others, and that backdrop becomes crucial to your role within Monster Hunter Stories 3.</p>
<p>Collecting monsters – or Monsties, as they have it here – has always been a key part of the series, building a Pokemon-like party of six to enable you to jump, fly, swim and perform various other environmental actions, while also trying to create a well-balanced team that can face off against any potential foe. However, in Stories 3, you’re also tasked with revitalising the local ecology, hatching and releasing monsters back into the wild to restore the habitat and bring the world back into balance.</p>

<p>Endangered species are found in the vicinity of invasive species – particularly nasty, and downright brutal monster variants that you need to scare off – and then you can hatch and release them into areas that will benefit from their appearance. As you increase the population, the area will then produce rarer or stronger eggs for you to hatch, making it feel as though you really are at work improving and working with the environment.</p>
<p>It’s a natural direction for the Stories series to lean into. The monster-riding action has always sat at odds with the mainline series’ traditional hunting and slaying, and living and working alongside monsters fits really well into the Rangers’ outlook and organisation. I can see it becoming a real timesink for players, and one that can result in some seriously cool and unusual monster variants.</p>

<p>They do, of course, all look absolutely amazing. Stories 3 art style is a gorgeous, anime-infused cavalcade of colour, building on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/07/monster-hunter-stories-2-switch-review-pc-wings-of-ruin/">Stories 2’s</a> excellent visuals, and then ramping everything up. Playing on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, the advantages of its extra power are clear to see, with much improved draw distances in the open field areas, and a more reliable level of performance, albeit one that occasionally needs to catch up with itself in more heavily populated, detailed areas.</p>
<p>Battles especially look truly stunning, and the added depth and challenge are made all the more enjoyable by the excellent animations and visual effects that accompany every move. The only mild negative is that they can be quite time-consuming, so once you’ve watched your Rathalos descend from the sky a bunch of times, you can speed combat up and whiz through less important encounters in seconds.</p>
<p>I have loved my early time with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. So far, it’s the most complete and grown-up, the Stories side of things has ever been, and it truly feels like the other side of the Monster Hunter coin – equally matched, and inextricably linked, despite all their differences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="453b8fd48c35f"><a title="Go Go Power Rangers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/453b8fd48c35f/go-go-power-rangers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo’s relationship with the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-monster-hunter-games-ranked-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series is an intriguing one – in one sense it’s at the heart of the IP with timed exclusives, but it’s also missed out on two blockbuster mainline entries in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Wilds</a>; perhaps Switch 2 will remedy that shortcoming. The spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Amonster-hunter-stories"><strong>Stories</strong> series</a>, however, started out as a late-gen 3DS game and the series has kept on coming to Nintendo hardware ever since.</p>
<p>The first two games offer a good time for those new to the IP, or fans that want an adventure a little less intense and challenging. They were largely (though not exclusively) cutesy in style, and while that’s still partially true with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, this does feel like an entry that’s following its audience. If you were young when you played the original, this may now fit well into your older sensibilities. It’s still charming and easygoing at times, but the tone has shifted a little.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, Twisted Reflection, like the two games before it, goes off on its own; you don’t need to be familiar with its predecessors to dive in here. The storytelling at times feels a little like modern <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> – gorgeous cutscenes in the preview section (the first 6-8 hours of the game) tell the tale of tensions between two nations, a world of endangered monster species and ecological collapse. There are some heavy themes, but they’re told with dashes of hope, and your role as a Prince and Ranger sees you working to improve the world in multiple ways.</p><figure data-uuid="829cfd76af4d8"><a title="It's a draw" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829cfd76af4d8/its-a-draw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right from the start, the storytelling, <em>gorgeous</em> orchestral music and cast of characters will draw you in. As a Monster Hunter RPG, it has a slow-ish opening hour, but after that I felt in a similar flow as I have in big-name genre IPs from the likes of Square Enix, Atlus, and Monolith Soft; Capcom’s team has evidently continued to mature in its approach to making an RPG that devours hours in each play session.</p>
<p>What’s also encouraging is that it’s done this while retaining the Stories style, at least in the early going. As in previous entries, you gradually build up a team of ‘Monsties’, cute takes on iconic franchise beasts that you can ride and team up with in battle, along with a companion and their Monstie.</p>
<p>Battles themselves retain the rock-paper-scissors approach, though with impressive depth. Initially, I have stuck to the same three weapon types, each of which can target specific monster parts with each move, but there are various others I haven’t yet touched.</p>
<p>Even in the early running, there looks to be a dizzying amount of detail for those that seek it, and it’ll be interesting to see if — like its predecessors — this is at least partially optional. Ways to customise and evolve Monsties return, gathering eggs to rear creatures to then release and revive regional ecologies seems prevalent, and already stores and armourers are offering <em>a lot</em> of tools to eventually get you through a presumably tough end-game. I’ll be intrigued to see how deep these mechanics go, how <em>necessary</em> they are to surviving towards the end, and just how fabulous our fashion can get as we encounter more monster types in the world.</p><figure data-uuid="0dbdb013d6717"><a title="It's a big world" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dbdb013d6717/its-a-big-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the opening sections it also seems that, beyond mechanical depth, this game is setting up for a decent amount of pure content. The story itself has — so far — introduced some key threads and then reached a dramatic denouement to set the scene for ‘Chapter 2’, but I’ve also enjoyed diving into side quests and side stories. The former are mostly basic ‘collect these things’ or ‘defeat this monster’, but the latter take you into little standalone vignettes with each companion in which you learn a little more about them. Even early on with only ‘Chapter 1’ for each side story available so far, there’s been a fair bit of gameplay variety and oodles of charm.</p>
<p>So far, so good. That said, I do have a mix of praise and minor issues around performance in this current version 1.0 build. As mentioned before, cutscenes — including those delivered in-engine — look and sound fantastic; I would also like to give a nod to the voice acting so far. While praise is generally given to RE Engine, this title is still clearly working on the foundations from the previous games; often it looks gorgeous, but sometimes it goes the other way.</p>
<p>Frame rate is <em>okay</em>, too. It's generally reasonable but appears to be unlocked and can veer from around 30fps at most times to occasional 60fps flashes in cutscenes (like combat special moves) or enclosed areas like caves. Docked play is better than handheld at present, as the image is certainly a good deal softer in the portable configuration. There are also regular blemishes, such as textures loading in late after scene cuts, which are hard to ignore. At times, it’s a <em>little</em> scruffy.</p><figure data-uuid="77ad05838d854"><a title="Slightly over the top move" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77ad05838d854/slightly-over-the-top-move.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aggressive motion blur and frame rate inconsistencies in crowded areas, as well as some dives in resolution on handheld especially, seem like areas that can hopefully be tidied up in the final weeks before launch.</p>
<p>I should also highlight that, overall, the game does look pretty good, but just because it is miles above the fidelity of a <em>certain</em> <em>bestselling monster-catching IP</em> doesn't negate it falling below other impressive RPGs early on in the Switch 2 lifecycle. However, this 1.0 build isn’t bad by any stretch, and at times the game has a bit of a wow factor. With a little refinement, it could certainly stand out further.</p>
<p>All told, our opening dalliances with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection are full of positives. Time will tell in the many hours to come whether this ultimately sets a new bar for this rather quirky but worthwhile spin-off series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review – Chrono Confusion]]></title>

            <guid>1433554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is an odd release this year. It is an updated version of a roguelike spin-off of Arc System Works' <em>BlazBlue</em> fighting game series. A series that's been mostly dead since 2016. This new update does add some new elements tying the game to the greater series, but these additions are minor, doing little to distract from the core game's lack of identity.</p><h2>Navigating The Possibilities</h2><p>The setup of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is relatively unchanged from the original PC and mobile release. You are a dowhoctor that is part of a think tank, performing experiments on a phenomenon known as the Sea of Possibility, a vast ocean of data displaying infinite branching timelines, alternate histories, and collapsed realities.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's all very simple, first we have to talk about parallel universes....</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These experiments involve exploring this huge landscape and searching for Shards of Possibility. These Shards may hold secrets to the think tank's ultimate goal of stopping the end of the world.</p><p>The connection is that the Shards of Possibility contain fragments of events from the <em>BlazBlue</em> series, and the avatars you use to explore are <em>BlazBlue</em> characters. In essence, the cast in this game are trying to make sense of arguably the most convoluted lore ever conceived for a fighting game franchise and to make sense of it.</p><p>I don't make that above statement likely. I played the <em>BlazBlue</em> games as they were coming out and tried to analyze them back when I had more free time than good sense. Even in comparison to another ArcSys franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/guilty-gear-strive-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear</em></a>, &nbsp;this series is way too complex for its own good. Centuries of war, reality-warping machine gods, a ton of overlapping time travel plots, time loops, branching timelines happening all at once, time ghosts, apocalyptic doomsday events, mad science, the list goes on.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Oh hey, it's that moment from that game from like twenty years ago.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a reason even dedicated <em>BlazBlue</em> fans can't understand half of what happens. Which, in a way, makes the cast of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> a sort of stand-in for its target audience.</p><p>Unfortunately, this framework leads to some pacing and narrative issues overall. The supporting cast of scientists are barely above stock anime stereotypes. The “revelations” offered by the Shards of Possibility are chosen at random and add little to the main plot. A few lightly touch on major elements like The Black Beast, the Cauldron, and the Boundary, but others will just reiterate various plot points like Ragna's death loop, or Iron Tager and Kokonoe's relationship. The plot states that these Shards will reveal some hidden secret, but the events amount to a scattered blast of references.</p><p>Because of this, the story of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> lacked any forward momentum or personal drive. I wasn't playing to get the next piece of the mystery; I was playing to see the next nostalgic callback and for someone else to deliver exposition. By the time the credits rolled, I was mostly checked out among a sea of technobabble.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, that's the Prisoner from Dead Cells. Yes, he's fighting ninjas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The Wheel of Fate is Turning</h2><p>Despite my gripes with the plot of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>, the core gameplay shines. &nbsp;Each run has you play through a series of levels and boss fights as a <em>BlazBlue</em> character. Keep going until you die or until you reach the final boss and win.</p><p>On paper, the shift from a 2D fighting game to a hack-and-slash platformer may seem horrendous, especially given <em>BlazBlue's</em> very technical, deliberate approach to fighting game mechanics. But it's a change that works relatively well. Character attacks are reduced to simple combo strings and one special attack tied to a mana bar. But as you progress from room to room, one of the items you can pick up, called Potential, slowly opens up that character's suite of moves and modifies their skills. This includes extra special attacks, multiple jumps, alternate attacks, and even more technical bonuses like jump cancels.</p><p>It's a change many <em>BlazBlue</em> fans may scoff at. Boiling down characters' movesets into something as complex as <em>Super Smash Bros</em> can be a step too far. But as someone who has put a lot of time into <em>Dead Cells</em>, this gameplay transition works great.</p><figure role="group">

                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blazblue-entropy-effect-x-susanoo-boss-fight.jpg?itok=BO9BVbpo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="900">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Joke's on you, I live for this input reading nonsense!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thankfully, this simplification doesn't change any of the characters' gameplay quirks. Ragna the Bloodedge is still a risk-reward character with his special attacks sapping his HP, but restores it upon getting a kill. Hakumen is slower, but has devastating block and parry effects. Noel still has her balletic aerial gun kata combos. Taokaka can still air juggle like a boss with her directional air dashes.</p><p>Sadly, these more technical details are the most interesting part of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> core gameplay. Rewards you get from room to room are a suite of elemental effects, buffs, and risky trade-offs. Nothing spectacular if you're familiar with the genre, but do help add spice to each subsequent run.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Which is good because the enemy variety is lacking. Ninjas, samurai, bugs, mad science experiments. Outside of a few challenge rooms, you'll get tired of fighting these minions pretty quickly.</p><p>The boss fights are only marginally better. The game even has two different boss rush challenge arenas that put these fights front and center. But they also suffer from derivative visual designs and predictable behaviors.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yeah, I do not want to lose i-Frames for any reason at all.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Crumbling Entropy</h2><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> meta progression does mitigate some of these issues. It features an Entropy and Extreme difficulty toggle, similar to the Heat system from the Hades games. You can adjust different elements of the game, like enemy numbers, aggression levels, or even putting time limits on finishing each fight.&nbsp;</p><p>When enough of these modifiers are active, you'll get certain benefits for that run, like extra health or earning extra upgrade points. &nbsp;In addition, completing runs grants you points that you can spend on your Mind Level, which increases your maximum health, and Mind Crystals, which are equippable buffs that can give you an edge. It's a solid system that helps mitigate some of the underbaked parts of the core combat.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Hey Arakune, how does this fire build feel?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sadly, the pacing issues I mentioned above grate against this core loop. As you play, you'll be given an objective to complete, which will unlock a Shard of Possibility. Unfortunately, you can only get one Shard per run. This means, depending on your skill level, you can end up doing several runs that are utterly pedestrian just to move the plot along.</p><p>A personal example is that I was completing runs at Extreme difficulty. But I wasn't getting a Shard to progress because I wasn't playing on Entropy difficulty. It is annoying pedantic padding.</p><p>Which brings me to another critique I do have with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. If you played the original PC/ Mobile release and were looking forward to new material, there isn't much here to justify another purchase. Aside from the new Extreme mode and its new boss fights, there is only one new playable character added to the roster: Naoto Kurogane from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blazblue-central-fiction-review-burning-blue-soul" rel="nofollow"><em>BlazBlue Central Fiction</em></a>. He is a welcome addition, but he only highlights the lack of other characters on the roster. No Iron Tager. No Platinum. No Bang Shishigami.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I didn't hate my time with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. The visuals are appealing. I enjoyed figuring out different combos and builds with each character. I loved seeing certain characters again in a new genre. I even enjoyed the replayability of the Entropy and Extreme modifiers.</p><p>But when that gameplay is wrapped around a meandering plot awkwardly gesturing at nostalgia and clashes with the core progression, it results in an experience wrapped in a <em>BlazBlue</em> skin rather than a meaningful spin-off.</p><hr><p><em><strong>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</strong> was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

              <p><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>, the cat-breeding tactical roguelike developed by Tyler Glaeil and </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac’s</span></i><span> Edmund McMillen, is still enjoying its moment in the sun. After earning its entire development budget back in its first three hours of release on February 10, </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span> smashed its 24-hour-old record of 65,962 concurrent players on Steam yesterday, drawing in 83,956 players on February 11. It will almost undoubtedly do the same again today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, even though </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-completionist-secrets-hours-binding-isaac-roguelike-2000667343"><span>Glaeil stated</span></a><span> that it will likely take “months or years” for players to find everything hidden away in </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>, at least one person took less than 24 hours to discover a character named Steven. The self-proclaimed “Mr. Resetti” of </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>, Steven will punish those attempting to save scum their way through the game by wresting control away from players.</span></p>

 <p><span>Steven was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mewgenics/comments/1r1cr3e/mr_resetti_showing_up_after_exiting_to_desktop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>first spotted</span></a><span> over on r/mewgenics by a player who had to leave “in the middle of combat.” </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i><span> fans will likely recognise Steven as one of the game’s bosses, but he actually originated in McMillen’s Newgrounds game </span><i><span>Time Fcuk. </span></i><span>Steven will appear in </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span> if you quit a run without saving, something which players might be tempted to do if a fight isn’t going their way. Or, as Steven puts it, he’ll only pop up if he spots you “fcuking with the game save.”</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8DUz82I-B0"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8DUz82I-B0</span></a></p> <p><span>The first time that he appears, Steven will simply admonish you for your save-scumming attempts, but warns you that the “gloves are off” if you attempt to save scum further. From here, he’ll start messing with your </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span> run. The second time you quit and reload during a run, Steven will inflict one of your cats with the “Deja Vu” disorder, which gives them a 10 percent chance to miss their turn.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the fourth attempt at save scumming is the true run killer, as Steven will take over your current </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>playthrough and attempt to finish it for you. According to everyone who has purposefully let Steven take over, he’s absolutely terrible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XN4jYLAyaA&amp;t=281s">As you can see here</a>, <em>Binding of Isaac </em>YouTuber </span><span>SlayXc2 managed to observe</span><span> the AI-controlled Steven making it through the first two fights, although he was already down to only one cat by the end of the second one.</span></p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/nba-2k-playgrounds-2-wwe-2k-battlegrounds-to-be-delisted-february-20th-servers-shut-down-july-9th/">DelistedGames.com</a>, the publisher announced that you only have until <strong>20th February</strong> to pick up a digital copy of either game before it leaves the storefront for good. The games' online servers will be sticking around until <strong>9th July</strong>, when they, too, will be shutdown — "After that time, all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function," the note reads.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tyihzr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, both games <em>do</em> have a certain amount of single-player content available, so you'll still be able to play through these modes offline after the cutoff date. That said, as pointed out by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/2k-is-delisting-a-wwe-game-and-an-nba-game-later-this-month-then-shutting-both-down-in-july/">VGC</a>, a lot of 2K's in-game unlockables are frequently tied to its online servers, thanks to the reliance on real-money transactions, so there's every chance that new character and cosmetic unlocks in both games will also wrap up with the server closure.</p>
<p>While both Playgrounds and Battlegrounds each have a physical release, bypassing the delisting somewhat, it's still a shame to see them taken down from the eShop (and all other digital storefronts, it seems).</p>
<p>We had a great time with Playgrounds 2 when it arrived on Switch way back in 2018, calling it "a bright and empowering way to defy gravity like Air Jordan himself" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/nba_2k_playgrounds_2">our review</a>. Things weren't so bright for WWE Battlegrounds on Switch, which we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/wwe_2k_battlegrounds">critiqued</a> for its "limited and repetitive combat, dopey AI, an excessively locked roster and a series of bewildering design choices that really should have been questioned at some point during production" — <em>yikes</em>.</p>

			<p>As <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> continues to celebrate its <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-turns-six-users-streamed-over-1b-hours-to-date/">sixth anniversary</a>, <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> cloud gaming platform is arriving on more platforms to turn "<em>every screen into a gaming machine</em>." The GeForce NOW app is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-amazon-fire-tv-app/">officially live</a> on <strong>Amazon Fire TV</strong> devices, and <strong>eight games</strong> join the cloud gaming library. Including <strong>Warhorse Studio's</strong> medieval RPG, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong>REANIMAL</strong>, the latest release from the original team behind the <strong>Little Nightmares </strong>games, <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes as part of yet another GFN Thursday, with a <strong>Capcom</strong>-dominated batch of games entering the cloud streaming service this week.

<p>Two of the games entering the service are doing so on launch, one being the aforementioned REANIMAL, which will be available as of tomorrow, <strong>February 13, 2026,</strong> with the other being <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/disciples-domination-arrives-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">Disciples: Domination</a></strong>, the turn-based strategy RPG from developer <strong>Artefacts Studio</strong> that's out today, February 12, on PC.

<p>The last but certainly not least game of the bunch to join the service is <strong>Torment: Tides of Numenera</strong>, a story-driven RPG that arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/272270/Torment_Tides_of_Numenera/">Steam</a> last month and takes players to a futuristic version of Earth called the <strong>Ninth World</strong>. You'll play as the Last Castoff, someone connected with extreme power who gets caught up in a larger mystery. You'll face more than a few moral quandaries as you try to determine the meaning and value of an individual life in this blend of sci-fi and fantasy from <strong>inXile Entertainment</strong>, the studio behind the <strong>Wasteland</strong> and <strong>Bard's Tale </strong>franchises.</p>

<p>As for the GFN's arrival on Amazon Fire TV devices, the GFN App is supported on three Fire TV Stick devices:</p>

              <p><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><span>soft reboot</span></a><span> began earlier this week, and part of the new lore-driven seasonal rollout is a Splatfest-style mechanic that has fans siding with either the titular peace-keeping group or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>terrorist organization Talon</span></a><span>. Yes, a lot of players have been playing heroes from both sides of this conflict over the past decade and might have some allegiances based on characters they main, but still, the number of fans making the heel turn to side with Talon is crazy.</span></p> <p><span>Siding with either faction gets you in-game rewards tied to different characters from both factions and you get lootboxes the further you progress, so there’s plenty of reason to pick one or the other in terms of in-game benefits. But what about the principle? What about seeing the world not as it is, but as it could be? When you were at your lowest and putting hundreds of hours into </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>in an unhealthy marathon, was it Vendetta who hyped you up? No, it was Winston, the soft-spoken gorilla scientist who put out the recall message a decade ago and has been fighting on the frontlines ever since. But one Emre voice line shows up and y’all switch up on him? You find Watchpoint Gibraltar in shambles and you stick your tail between your legs and join the bad guys? Crazy.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Talon’s support sits around 55-60 percent depending on when you look at it, the Overwatch backers aren’t quietly giving up, and are putting these disloyal payload pushers on blast.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Y'ALL FAKE AF<br>THEY SET GIBRALTAR ON FIRE AND YOU JUMP SHIP??? <a href="https://t.co/Ygstt6I8Wf">pic.twitter.com/Ygstt6I8Wf</a></p> <p>— uguubear 🧈🐻 AniYEG B08 (@uguubear) <a href="https://twitter.com/uguubear/status/2021777015742050393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">you mfs are actual traitors bro, winston stood by your side in ow1 every single day since overwatch 1s death and yall STILL CHOSE TALON <a href="https://t.co/g8s3KZQA6O">pic.twitter.com/g8s3KZQA6O</a></p> <p>— hatori🗯️ (@kornyflake) <a href="https://twitter.com/kornyflake/status/2021678776728662473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Y'all niggas fake as fuck for real <a href="https://t.co/GHCbhoyfEF">pic.twitter.com/GHCbhoyfEF</a></p> <p>— ensee (@enseecan) <a href="https://twitter.com/enseecan/status/2021716165870112950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">overwatch vs talon event <a href="https://t.co/JepwsXSWgM">pic.twitter.com/JepwsXSWgM</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2021861631152832856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GUYS PLEASE DO SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO LET WINSTON DOWN GUYS PLEASE <a href="https://t.co/0f9PbcKmfm">pic.twitter.com/0f9PbcKmfm</a></p> <p>— Spider-Brian (@SpiderBrian_) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderBrian_/status/2021807881625186472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Deshonra<br>Deshonra en esta familia<br>Talon son terroristas, el mundo necesita a overwatch, el mundo necesita a HÉROES<br>PIENSA EN WINSTON, EL ESTUVO AHÍ PARA TÍ 🫵 <a href="https://t.co/BoIDn5nFqE">pic.twitter.com/BoIDn5nFqE</a></p> <p>— Ori🍯💛🤍💜🖤 (@Ori_two_point_3) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ori_two_point_3/status/2021849244341006500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Talon vs Overwatch event is giving me the same anxiety as the presidential race</p> <p>— Valeria Talon Agent 😈 (@ElvisBadger) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElvisBadger/status/2021875193350893783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>You’re able to switch between the two periodically, so there’s still time for those who have sided with Talon to lock in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard didn’t arrive with much hype, its build-up was even less prominent, and the final result can only be considered a disaster that resulted in substantial layoffs for Highguard developer Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>The final game announcement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" id="163455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. Whereas millions of players were hoping for a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloodborne/" id="1320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a>, or something earth-shatteringly big, Geoff Keighley couldn’t contain his excitement as Highguard was finally revealed.</p>



<p>Highguard’s Steam player base plummeted by over 95% in just over two weeks. The downward decline has had detriental effects, but it was hard to see anything else happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-wasn-t-highguard-a-success">Why Wasn’t Highguard A Success? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>The mounts are cool at least. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard was a decent game at launch with next-to-no redeeming qualities or innovative features. In a saturated market of live-service shooters and free-to-play games, Highguard didn’t have anywhere near enough content at launch to suggest it could last, and the frosty reception to Highguard’s TGA 2025 reveal ultimately caused the title’s instant downfall.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</h3>



<p>Geoff Keighley has a reputation for hyping things up that don’t always deliver, and there’s nothing wrong with that. One person’s view won’t resonate with everyone, maybe not at all. But giving Highguard the sign-off slot for TGA 2025 meant the game had to dazzle and deliver.</p>



<p>Expectations for The Game Awards, Summer Game Fest, and other mega showcases are usually unrealistically high. Players want EVERYTHING and usually don’t get anything they want. When a baying audience is clinging on for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-life-3/" id="2259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3</a> or an announcement to end all, Highguard was not seen as it. Social media (for the most part) wasn’t giving Highguard much of a chance, getting the game off to a bad start.</p>







<p>From December 11 (TGA 2025) until a few days before launch, Highguard’s socials were like a ghost town. YouTube, X, you name it; no gameplay footage, no new trailers, and nothing from Wildlight. Some viewed this as a deliberate marketing strategy designed to build intrigue and curiosity close to its debut.</p>



<p>There’s a thought that had Highguard been highly anticipated, the gaming community would have accepted it. Instead, it cast more negative light on Highguard, even bringing doubt about its future. Finally, on January 23, a gameplay showcase was announced—taking place minutes before the servers went online. It was a bold strategy.</p>



<p>Further clarification arrived when it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard was meant to be a ‘Shadowdrop’, but Geoff Keighley wanted it at The Game Awards</a>. In hindsight, a shadowdrop possibly could’ve helped the game’s fortunes by not giving people time to make up their mind in advance.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard-s-release-amp-reception">Highguard’s Release &amp; Reception</h3>



<p>It was go time, and anyone interested in Highguard finally got to see what the fuss was all about. The early signs were good, as the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-website-crashes-after-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard website crashed after the game’s launch</a>. People flocked to the F2P shooter like birds to bread, but opinions formulated very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-receives-mostly-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Mostly Negative” reviews bombarded Steam</a>, and complaints about the shooter were quite common:</p>



<ul>
<li>The maps were too big.</li>



<li>The loot phase of the match was boring.</li>



<li>Action was fairly limited outside of the Raid phase.</li>



<li>Wardens were fairly generic.</li>



<li>PC performance issues.</li>



<li>The price of microtransactions.</li>



<li>Highguard’s identity was lacking by being too many games wrapped into one perfect package.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-post-launch">Post-Launch</h3>



<p>A steep and instant player drop-off prompted the developer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">target the game’s biggest gripes</a>. Credit to Wildlight, they addressed the nature of big maps and small teams with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent addition of a 5v5 Raid Mode</a>.</p>



<p>With Episode 1 underway and a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard 2026 Roadmap</a>, the team must have thought the game had a chance. Barely two weeks later, the game’s all-time Steam peak of <strong>97,249</strong> turned into a <strong>3,580</strong> 24-hour peak by mid-February.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-amp-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs-explained">Highguard &amp; Wildlight Entertainment Layoffs, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On February 11, it was reported and confirmed that Wildlight Entertainment had to “part ways with a number of our team members” as part of mass layoffs caused by Highguard’s unsuccessful start.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming wishes nothing but the best for any developers laid off from Wildlight Entertainment. It’s not clear how many people have succumbed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard’s mass layoffs</a>, but Alex Graner,&nbsp;a senior-level designer at&nbsp;Wildlight, said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAC6BrrgBpUHb8knP90WlCSh1NG5KV8KkS30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post that it was <strong>he and “most of the team at Wildlight.”</strong></p>



<p>An official Wildlight statement has since said it is: “Keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.” So, if you are enjoying Highguard, its development looks to be continuing for now.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Like Concord, XDefiant, the relaunched MultiVersus, and so many other live-service games before it, you have to wonder how long Highguard has left. If the player exodus continues, its future could be bleak.</p>

			<p><strong>Peter Molyneux</strong>, the original creator of the <strong>Fable</strong> franchise at <strong>Lionhead Studios</strong>, shared his first impressions on the upcoming reboot after watching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent presentation at the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f-me-this-thing-that-we-created-its-going-to-live-peter-molyneux-cried-watching-xboxs-new-fable-gameplay-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a>, Molyneux revealed that <strong>he got emotional</strong> at the idea that the Fable IP, which he and the rest of Lionhead spent so much time on, would return. He also pointed out that <strong>it was a good idea for Playground to reboot the series</strong>, and added that he agreed with the twist of the protagonist's village inhabitants turning to stone at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p><em>When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up. I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.</em></p>



<p><em>And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.</em></p>



<p><strong>He did have a few nitpicks</strong>, though, specifically directed toward the game's supposed "cleanliness":</p>



<p><em>If I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it. But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.</em></p>



<p>That said, Molyneux confirmed <strong>he absolutely plans to play the game once it comes out</strong>, which is supposedly this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>First, the game designer will have to focus on his own new game, the "God game" <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/masters-of-albion-release-date-22-cans-peter-molyneux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Masters of Albion</a></strong>, due to launch on Steam Early Access in late April. Molyneux called it <strong>the culmination of his life's work</strong>. The first gameplay trailer was released yesterday; you can find it below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Can Get GTA 6 For Free, But You Need To Tick a HUGE Box First]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-for-free-but-huge-tick-box/</link>
            <guid>1433482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is in eager anticipation of the impending release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It will arguably be the biggest single-game release in history, shifting millions of copies in the first few hours alone, and it’s set to break the internet, render countless gamers incapable of working, and dominate social and streaming feeds for weeks to come.</p>



<p>In case you had concerns about <strong>buying </strong>Grand Theft Auto 6 later this year, there is a method you can use to get GTA 6 <strong>for free</strong>, but it involves one hell of a requirement.</p>



<p>You need to have a baby on November 19, 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-joke-says-norwegian-firm">It’s Not a Joke, Says Norwegian Firm</h2>



<p>In Norway, an electronics firm named Komplett has kick-started a marketing campaign built around rewarding budding parents with a free copy of GTA 6.</p>



<p>If you conceive<strong> around now</strong>, you’ll likely be celebrating the birth of your child around the release date of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set (at the moment) for November 19, 2026. If your baby is born <strong>on that day</strong>, Komplett will help you usher in your bouncing bundle of joy by giving you a free copy of GTA 6, arguably the most anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1r20w92/a_norwegian_electronic_store_is_giving_away_gta_6/">‘Gaming’ subreddit</a>, one user posted an image of an advertisement spotted at a railway station in Norway. It was a shot of rose petals on a ruffled bed, with the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA 6 dropping in 9 months 😉</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUngTvzDXsD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Instagram post</a> surfaced from the company, bearing the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>this is actually not a joke, GTA 6 will be released in 9 months (🤞) and if you have a baby on the release date, you’ll get the game for free from us</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a marketing stunt that could pay off in dividends for the firm, as every man and their dog wants to secure a copy of Grand Theft Auto 6, and what better way to do that than to get it <strong>for free</strong>? Coincidentally, GTA 6 will be released almost nine months to the day after Valentine’s Day.</p>



<p>What’s ironic is that you’ll most likely be knee-deep in diapers and formula, and will have much bigger concerns than scoping out the jiggle physics or the deepest secrets of Leonida in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

You can also find preorders for <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8pXq?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secrets of Strixhaven boosters</a> down to $149.99 as well right now.

There are usually 5 Commons, 4 Uncommons, 5 Rare or Mythic Rare cards, a Land and a Token, but the rub here is that 6 of the included cards have a 'booster Fun frame' and 12-13 of them are foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other TCG news, there are also some great deals on Pokémon cards right now at Amazon and TCGplayer, including a great deal on the most recent expansion's booster bundle, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-booster-bundles-amazon-update-2026">Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-wait-mewtwo-is-finally-returning-to-pokemon-go</link>
            <guid>1433470</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of wait and fan expectation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> players will finally be able to capture Mewtwo once more — in just a few months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon was last available to battle in Pokémon Go all the way back in July 2022, though its Shadow form was available more recently — over a weekend in March 2024. Still, fans have been clamouring for another chance to add the creature to their Pokédex ever since — and now it's almost time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further details for this summer's Go Fest celebrations have now been announced at a press event held in Tokyo, which will host one of three in-person meetups, ahead of the game's usual global Go Fest celebration. Artwork shown at the event confirms that Mewtwo will return — and hints at the debut of a Mythical Pokémon species, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/hofqczmawzig1-1770896578342.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2026 artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Artwork for the Tokyo event shows the usual array of Kanto species, as well as popular croc Sandile. Of most note, though, is the Mewtwo floating within the image — confirming its long-awaited return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't say anything specific, but look forward to the Pokémon featured in the key visual," a spokesperson told Japanese Pokémon outlet <a href="https://x.com/rocketnews24go/status/2021811416643383764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rocketnews24go</a>, via machine translation. "Especially Mewtwo — I think it'll be heart-pounding excitement for people who’ve been participating in GO Fest since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will this finally be the moment Mewtwo's Mega Evolutions become available, after years of wait? Mega Mewtwo X and Y remain the only missing evolutions from the franchise's original batch of Mega Pokémon. Meanwhile, the game will soon be moving on to the release of Megas from Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with the arrival of Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebell later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mewtwo is only shown here for Pokémon Go Fest's Tokyo event, artwork such as this usually shows species also available (to a greater or lesser extent) at the following global Go Fest — and it seems inconceivable that the creature would only be made available in a local version, when there has been such hype for its return generally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same is true of this year's Go Fest logo, which as ever features a subtle hint at the latest upcoming Mythical creature to become available. Looking at the mini blue lightning bolts on the 2026 design, Mythical Pokémon Zeraora seems a safe bet. The creature recently gained a new Mega Evolution, which would also make for a fitting release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year is, of course, the 30th anniversary of Pokémon and the 10th anniversary of Pokémon Go — a pair of milestones that fans expect to be celebrated fully this summer. Word on what else is coming to the Pokémon franchise this year will follow shortly on Pokémon Day — February 27 — which is when it's expected that the series' 10th generation of games and creatures will be unveiled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Players can customize the characters’ appearance using dyes found throughout Pywel or crafted through alchemy, adjusting outfits, hairstyles, and tattoos to match individual preferences.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Cities and villages across the Pywel continent are depicted as being populated by blacksmiths, tailors, merchants, and residents in need of assistance.

<p>At least 1,200 staff taking part</p>

<figure data-uuid="44d4e35de71ab"><a title="Ubisoft Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44d4e35de71ab/ubisoft-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last month, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> which saw, among many other things, several studio closures and six game cancellations. This week, in response to the changes, at least 1,200 Ubisoft workers have taken to the streets in a three-day international strike.</p>
<p>The strike began on 10th February and runs until today. Ubisoft Paris' Solidaires Informatique union representative, Marc Rutschlé, told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">Gamesindustry.biz</a> that the strike mainly took place in Paris, though there has also been "additional activity" at Ubisoft Milan.</p>
<p>"At this stage, it seems clear to us that [Ubisoft CEO] Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees," Rutschlé told Gamesindustry, "The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan."</p>
<p>Rutschlé said that the Ubisoft staff are "already working under pressure, often understaffed," with no meaningful pay rises in "several years". On top of this, Ubisoft has issued a return-to-office mandate to "boost the collective performance of AAA," which requires all staff to work five days a week from the Ubisoft offices — a policy that previously saw employees walk out on strike back in 2024.</p>
<p>The Solidaires Informatique union organised a smaller strike on 22nd January, the day after Ubisoft published its restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Today (12th Feb) marks the end of <em>this</em> strike, but it remains to be seen whether any further action will come in the future. Ubisoft itself will be sharing additional information on the restructure today, so we'll keep an eye out for any developments.</p>

<h2 id="h-vitality-picks-up-killer-warzone-team-for-ewc">Vitality Picks Up Killer Warzone Team for EWC</h2>



<p>Leading the Team Vitality squad into the fray at the Esports World Cup this summer will be Ethan ‘Ebatez’ Bates, a former 100 Thieves coach with skin in the game. The championship-grade roster should have no issues competing on the grandest stage in esports in Riyadh this summer.</p>



<p>Sage was previously signed with Virtus and finished in <strong>third place </strong>at last year’s Esports World Cup. He also had a close finish at the 2024 Global Finals of the World Series of Warzone, but <strong>won </strong>the 2023 Global Finals, alongside Shifty and Biffle.</p>



<p>Blazt, one of the most recognizable names in Call of Duty, has been around the houses over the last decade. His path has taken him under the banners of compLexity, G2 Esports, the Los Angeles Guerrillas, 100 Thieves, and now, Team Vitality. He’ll be looking to redeem a fourth-place finish at last year’s Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Skullface is arguably entering the pack with something major to prove. It has been a while since his last big win, but he came <strong>second </strong>at the 2024 World Series of Warzone after clutching up and securing the top spot in 2022’s tournament.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s a pretty good squad, and every player there has <strong>years </strong>of Warzone experience to pull from.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s enough for Team Vitality to land a big win at the Esports World Cup this summer? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

The story is a little by the numbers and exploration does have a lot of back and forth, but the different regions and enemies look great and the narrative is elevated by Aran and Adso’s relationship.”</em></p>

            <guid>1433422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161929/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it, there are three different versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>. First, there’s the game as promised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKD83Z1RbR0">in the trailers</a>: a survival horror with some general emphasis on resource management and gunplay, all elevated with some nice-looking cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Sweeping cameras slowly reveal the ominous presence of creepily deformed lab creatures. Moody pans pass over entrail-covered woodlands. And emotive close-ups show dramatic angles of the lead character, Elena, as she searches for her friend, Lou, who went missing in the opening. It’s all very appealing. Throw in a high-end voice-over and some occasional '80s synths, and you’d be forgiven for thinking I Hate This Place was going to knock your <strong>Stranger Things</strong> socks off.</p>
<p>But the truth is the trailers are pretty damningly misleading, and not a second of that narrative flair has made it into the game. Instead, the story is told via some fixed-camera early-'00s-era cutscenes that brought back memories of a simpler time in gaming.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161931/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I say all of this because I Hate This Place comes with a fairly hefty price tag ($29.99 USD / £26.49), and I feel it’s important to give realistic expectations. If you were to compare the game to the trailer, what you’d see is more of an echo, a ghostly shimmer of what was being promised elsewhere.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make I Hate This Place <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>As for versions two and three, well, the difference here belongs to that familiar old story – the late-night campfire tales of underpowered hardware struggling to run contemporary, seemingly demanding games. This here is a Switch ‘1’ game – and more often than not, it shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked at some videos for other systems, I realised just <em>how much</em> I Hate This Place was suffering on the Switch. On more powerful hardware, the game looks pretty great. Elena’s torch casts accurate shadows from the legs of giant spiders. The shine of the spectral underworlds you visit to solve the mysterious origin stories of a number of ghosts looks great and suitably otherworldly and strange.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161932/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch, however, I was often distracted by visual ticks during my six-hour playthrough. Elena’s shoes sometimes clipped through textures on the floor. Cutscenes suddenly jumped back to earlier moments in the story – or ended inexplicably short. Often, ghosts disappeared instantly as if someone had forgotten to add an effect.</p>
<p>I could go on complaining, but here’s the twist: despite the lack of finesse, I had a pretty good time. For me, too many of the big releases of the last year have felt as if they were going through the motions – but with I Hate This Place, I at least felt as if developers Rock Square Thunder were reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>The core gameplay — the twin-stick shooting and combat — won me over quickly. Sneaking around, creeping past monsters, and crafting new weapons and bombs to deal with any that got too close was fun. I soon found an enjoyable balance between being cautious and gung-ho. I enjoyed throwing Molotov cocktails at mutated creatures, watching them burn, and then picking them off with a few rounds of my newly crafted rifle.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161927/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether exploring swamps or mines, the challenge felt well judged, and each section lasted just long enough. The story — loosely based on a comic series about a haunted ranch and its surrounding wilderness — does a lot of heavy lifting. It grabbed my attention early on and showed enough creativity to win me over some more.</p>
<p>Less positively, though, in larger areas the performance often fell apart, dropping to a hauntingly low couple of frames per second. Some players will find this unforgivable, but for those like me who spent the best part of the last 10 years playing compromised ports, I coped with these moments well enough. Maybe that’s a testament again to the fun gameplay.</p>
<p>The last misleading element of the trailer concerns the crafting and the building. I’ve read some takes in the last few days that painted these crafting elements as more than they are, because in truth they’re very underdeveloped – seemingly remnants of ideas that had to be canned or simplified for whatever reason. For me, crafting more bullets, upgrading a weapon or two, and keeping bandages stocked was all I ever needed, and as someone not that bothered by exhaustive resource management, I was okay with that.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161928/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I can’t give I Hate This Place a higher score than the one below. The technical issues and a lack of finesse haunt almost every nook and cranny of its game world. But I also want to stress again that it’s often very fun, too. It’s not one I’d recommend full price on Switch, but if you can tolerate uneven performance and you enjoy scrappy, experimental survival shooters, there’s something here worth playing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I Hate This Place is a game that oversells itself in the trailer and undershoots on the Switch, but still manages to be very enjoyable. The performance issues, visual compromises, and pared‑back crafting leave their mark on much of the experience, yet the core loop of sneaking, crafting, and blasting through strange supernatural threats has enough bite to carry it.</p>
<p>When the action flows, it’s easy to see what the developers were aiming for. It just depends on whether you’re willing to look past the rough edges to enjoy what <em>does</em> work.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crisol-theater-idols-review-steam-horror-shooter-spanish-2000667876</link>
            <guid>1433419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Crisol: Theater of Idols</span></i><span>‘ richly illustrated world</span> <span>is deeply familiar to me. Maybe there’s a certain segment of players who’ll play it and note the same parallels I couldn’t help but draw. Though it bears a lot in common with a number of legendary games, like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span>, this survival-horror title, which takes just as many cues from Spanish culture and folklore as it does from those legendary games, feels most in conversation with something entirely different: it reminds me a lot of the telenovelas I grew up watching on Univision.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Latine households have a few common staples. Adobo seasoning in our pantries. Daily variants of </span><i><span>arroz con habichuelas</span></i><span> with your protein of choice. A Bible of some sort, a crucifix, or related Christian imagery on the walls. Maybe a sticker that reads, “</span><i><span>Dios es amor.”</span></i><span> And, of course, a constant rotation of </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>in the evenings.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Novellas </span></i><span>are the height of drama and camp. There is a twist around every corner, and you’ll never miss it because these cheaply produced series will reuse the same loud sound effect to denote every dramatic development in the story. Think the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc7Cin_87H4"><span>Vine “boom,”</span></a><span> but every 15 minutes (charitably). Like any good soap opera, they’re often packed with too many characters to count, let alone recall at the drop of a hat. Depending on the genre–</span><i><span>novellas</span></i><span> can follow teenagers who </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVagT0B3cos&amp;list=RDvVagT0B3cos&amp;start_radio=1"><span>break into songs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZc97aIDTUE&amp;list=PLlpTGFsKPu1k2_4mKo6Ou9iP9H6eNjRL-"><span>drug lords rising through the ranks</span></a><span>, and everything in between–these characters are usually tried-and-true archetypes, like the stumbling nerd or the doggedly loyal cadet/soldier/cop. And if there’s one thing these </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>actors are gonna do, it’s ham things up.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>These programs, which have often enraptured the elders of my life, promised big performances, and it seemed like every other show my mother watched during these primetime slots featured booming voices, grand gestures, and </span><a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/news/a31651/10-best-novelas-of-all-time/"><span>more lies and betrayals</span></a><span> than one should be able to feasibly fit into a half-hour block. These shows and performances often oscillated between scintillating and corny, never anywhere in between.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I need you all to understand this, because I couldn’t shake the feeling while playing </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>that I was caught in a fever dream of a </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is a halfway decent survival horror title with some great creature design, but what it really is underneath all that is a good ol’ Spanish soap. One with plenty of dramatic twists, a few too many characters, and some of the most hammed-up performances a game has ever shipped with. I love its deeply Spanish, deeply flawed heart.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, from the Madrid-based developer Vermila Studio,</span> <span>is a tragedy told in a handful of chapters. Each of them takes Gabriel, the game’s zealous protagonist and aforementioned loyal soldier archetype, to a corner of Tormentosa, an island and colony caught in a torrential downpour. It is also caught in a religious civil war by the time that Gabriel washes up on its shores. It’s a conflict that calls for Gabriel to battle the forces of the sea god with weapons blessed (maybe even cursed, actually) by the sun god and which use his own blood as ammunition.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667878"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667878">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I enjoyed this aspect of </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, though I wouldn’t call it my favorite part of the equation. I dig the metaphor, which calls into question the sacrifices that organized religion typically demands, especially of its most ardent followers. How much is Gabriel willing to bleed to see his god back in power? What actions is he willing to take, regardless of his own moral standing, to see his will done? These are questions that are blunted by the kind of game </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is–you can’t opt out of combat here–and the answer to both proves to be: </span><i><span>a lot</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of Gabriel’s weapons is, both literally and metaphorically, blood-starved, and he is plenty happy to give them everything for his cause. It is always just a smidge spine-chilling to hear or see the spikes that pierce Gabriel and drain him, as well as literally just see his blood in the cartridge of his weaponry. His opponents are similarly visually arresting. Wooden statues derived from Catholic imagery (the religion is never name-dropped but sure is heavily alluded to) lumber through the streets waiting to be carefully dismembered by precise shots of your pistol or rifle, but I could often fall back on a shotgun to blast these things to splinters and assure they’d stay down. Eventually, these enemies grow to encompass other bits of religious imagery and architecture as you encounter towering golems lined with stone faces and monstrosities born from stained glass.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regrettably, though, </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s combat is just fine. Shots land with a satisfying heft and it’s awesome to occasionally take out a leg or a knife-wielding arm and buy yourself a few seconds to consider your next move. Beyond this, though, enemies require very little thought, especially after you’ve netted a few upgrades, and the overwhelming amount of healing afforded to you on a normal playthrough chafes against and neuters the sacrificial effect of the central blood mechanic. I quickly became numb to the notion of refilling my weapons and depleting my HP because I was either flush with syringes, or knew that the game was hiding some form of healing right around the corner.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Here, the game dovetails back into the campy territory of those previously mentioned </span><i><span>novellas. </span></i><span>Remember that Vine boom I referenced earlier, and the repeated deployment of a dramatic audio cue? </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>has its own “haunting” series of sounds it will frequently play, only these sounds are triggered by the act of draining dead carcasses, often of animals, for blood/ammo. Tormentosa’s streets are littered with the cadavers of chickens that can be drained of their blood…only </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>takes this opportunity to then play a hilariously faint cuckoo, which happens </span><i><span>every time </span></i><span>you drain the blood from the poor birds. A dead pig will squeal. A horse-like beast might bray. Though I can’t speak to the intention, it definitely comes across as a comic beat rather than a dramatic one.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>occasionally blurs this line between corny melodrama and unintentional comedy to mixed results. While Gabriel is straight-laced and bottoned-up, he eventually gains an ally, called Mediodia, who provides exposition and comic relief in equal measure. The performance here (especially in the native Castellano Spanish, which </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>be the default voice track of the game) and her back-and-forth with Gabriel makes her come across as a goblin-like, torturous little sister. It’s disarming hearing them banter moments after a new development in the story or tense encounter against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s enemies, but such is the dramatic range of a typical </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>chapter, which might follow up a subplot about infidelity or grief with a recurring sight gag or a detour into a humorous B-plotline. It is about as novel as it is jarring.</span></p> <p><span>Consider, then, how it comes across when these moments of camp and levity, intended or not, smash up against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s main plotline, in which one religious sect has violently persecuted another and you are attempting to overthrow a god with a blood-tinged armory, all the while unraveling the conflict that has plagued Tormentosa, recounted through flashbacks–which play out as vignettes with faceless, sanguine red silhouettes– illustrating the island’s violent and dramatic implosion.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000667877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667877"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667877">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Lest you think I find all of its </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>qualities grating or otherwise dubious, I do think that </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s penchant for drama brings out the best in its performers. It is rare to hear an entire cast of Spanish speakers in a game where that audio track is not just a haphazardly produced dub. Here are performances built upon the strength of our language, given by actors with the ability to properly enrich the words on the page with texture and specificity. It is even more thrilling to have them unreservedly go for it. The voice actress for Dolores, a particularly menacing foe who stalks Gabriel throughout the game, is a standout “big” performance, but many others fare pretty well here too, including the protagonist’s VA. Arroyo, one of the game’s more obvious baddies, and even the sun god have incredible presences, even if they are heard more than they are seen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not every performance is as stunning though, and quite a number of them get lost in the shuffle. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s acts are dense with their own ensembles, and characters within them are usually working against one another. In the seemingly unending deluge of conflicts on Tormentosa, some more complex than others, it can be a little harder than usual to nail down motivations and characters worth rooting for, or even simply tracking throughout the narrative. I typically felt adrift in </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s smaller stories, only to be reeled back in when the narrative shined a light on one of its grander performers and more dramatic material.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a word, </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is uneven, and that’s the most </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>-ass thing about it. See, the thing about </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>is that though they attempt it all–comedy, melodrama, camp, action, steamy romance, and thrills of all sorts–they also kind of fizzle out by their end. The balancing act is tough to maintain so consistently. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s ambitions seem to lie all over the place, but despite that, it still brings out top-notch performances. I was hooked on its drama plenty enough to blast through Tormentosa’s clubs, caverns, and cathedrals. And it is a competent enough survival-horror title to thrill and occasionally provide a good scare along the way, even if it feels at times like its action and horror is pulling its punches. But for all its missteps, I couldn’t help but love </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s authentically Spanish heart, and I can’t help but desire more of it. From </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>and from games at large.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Lego's new Pokémon sets are right around the corner, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, A.K.A. Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>If you're a little unsure as to whether these sets are right for you, Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has recently got his hands on every available product, including Eevee, Pikachu, and Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, we also get a good look at the pre-order bonus Kanto Badge set, and the Lego Insiders Mini Pokémon Center set. There are other videos available online for each individual set, but this is one gives us a glimpse at all of them in one go – nice.</p>
<p>It's a pretty decent showcase of the new sets, overall. For example, we're pretty confident that the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">PIkachu</a> set (£179.99 / $199.99) just isn't for us – it just looks a bit weird, don't you think? <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">The Starter Evolutions</a> looks pretty incredible, but you'd expect that for the ludicrous price of £579.99 / $649.99, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Eevee</a> looks okay though, and at £54.99 / $59.99, it's definitely on the more affordable end of the scale. Though to be honest, referring to any Lego set as "affordable" is probably a bit of a stretch these days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also pre-order the new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Focarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle</a> set right now for £99.99. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/video-get-a-closer-look-at-legos-new-zelda-ocarina-of-time-set-in-this-first-review">Tiago Catarino also got his hands on this set recently</a>, and we have to admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>

			<p>While <strong>CAPCOM's</strong> <strong>RE Engine</strong> gathered a controversial reputation in the past few years due to the spotty performance of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/"><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></a></em>, the game engine fares significantly better in more linear games. Among the games that does not suffer from any major performance issues caused by the engine itself is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/"><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</strong></a>, but a <strong>recent update</strong> to the PC version has essentially put the game in a <strong>worse condition than it was at launch</strong>.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Updating years old software with new DRM is stupid,"</em> noted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Digital Foundry’s</strong> Alex Battaglia. The tech expert's analysis confirms that on a Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 4070 Super build, the introduction of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Enigma Protector DRM</strong> has gutted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU game throughput by 40%</strong>. While the gap shrinks to 20% in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Village</em> fight due to the AI powering the enemies, which introduces a different bottleneck, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impact remains constant</strong> in other scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't an isolated incident for the Japanese publisher. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">C</strong>APCOM has recently made similar moves with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Revelations</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 5</em>, sparking a wave of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">anti-consumer backlash</strong> across the community. As YouTube user @chemeergency put it: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Retroactively implementing new DRM over old DRM is insanely anticonsumer."</em> And it's not doing the publisher any favors, either, as some may be more inclined to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">go with the pirated version</strong> for better performance.</p>



<p>With <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> on the horizon, some may wonder if the latest entry will be similarly impacted. However, the game is <strong>confirmed to use Denuvo on PC</strong>, complete with the standard five-activation limit. While <strong>Denuvo</strong> has its own issues, its <strong>impact on performance is lighter</strong> than <em>Enigma Protector</em>. Hopefully, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> will realize that protecting three-year-old games at the cost of the player experience is a losing battle by the time the <strong>ninth entry</strong> in the series requires a DRM update.</p>
