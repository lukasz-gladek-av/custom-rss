		<p>The Ukraine-based developers behind the acclaimed Metro series have announced La Quimera, a brand new sci-fi shooter set in a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>La Quimera (which translates to The Chimera in English) takes players to a Latin American megalopolis with a lush jungle setting, casting you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, those robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go it alone, with La Quimera featuring support for up to 3-player co-op through the story.</p>
<p>From the trailer and imagery released today, there’s a great look to this game, both on a technical level, and stylistically. There’s a classic Killzone vibe to seeing enemy soldiers with the glowing eyes on their armoured masks.</p>

<p>“Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>
<p>La Quimera is coming from Reburn, the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, while the 4A Games brand, 4A Games Malta studios and the Metro series all remain with Embracer Group and its publishing label Plaion. Reburn is a team of over 110 developers that previously worked on that Metro series, with a wealth of experience going back through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>, Metro: Last Light and Metro 2033, and even back to the founders working on the original STALKER. La Quimera’s development is being led by Sasha Kostiuk, who served as gameplay and AI designer on Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light.</p>
<p>While the setting will be completely different, let’s look back at this team’s most recent work. Metro Exodus released in 2019, taking the post-apocalyptic tale out on the tracks to head across Siberia. Nicole scored it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">an excellent 9/10</a>, saying, “Metro Exodus provides an immersive FPS experience that marks a new milestone for the franchise. Its survival-horror, sandbox and shooter elements are remarkably well balanced, constituting an engaging and thrilling game that’ll leave you no stranger to a good jump scare. The once linear horror franchise has been reformed, introducing expansive environments to indulge in without derailing the narrative. Metro Exodus is a must play.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, 4A Games Ukraine made two big announcements: one, it's being rebranded to Reburn; two, it is developing a new cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter game called La Quimera.</p>
<p>First things first. Metro fans were probably puzzled by the aforementioned sentence, just like I was when I got the news. Let's clarify things right away, then. Following the beginning of the political instability in Ukraine, dating all the way back to 2014, part of the team at 4A Games moved to Malta. Back then, both studios still worked together on Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>After the launch of Metro Exodus in 2019, 4A Games Malta and 4A Games Ukraine were both big enough to handle projects separately. A few months later, the Malta office <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games-new-world-interactive-and-four-more-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired by Embracer</a>, while the Ukraine office remained independent and received unrelated investments to make its own IP, which would become La Quimera. The studios are effectively separate now, as reflected in the rebrand, although they are both allowed to use the 4A Engine seen in Metro titles.</p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series. We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>

<p>The game is set in a Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle environments. Players will step into the customizable exosuit of a down-on-his-luck PMC (Private Military Company) soldier battling rival factions. The world and story of La Quimera were written and created by movie director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren. Combining Latin American folklore with advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera will be playable in single-player mode or with up to two friends in co-op for a total of three players.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRoLav0VCYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reburn promises that fans of the Metro franchise will enjoy the familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling mixed with new gameplay experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons. There's no release date yet, but Reburn said more about the game will be revealed in the coming months.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1120545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

There were updates on <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, a new season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a totally new multiplayer gameplay: <em>Pokémon Champions</em>.</p><p>While the reveal was light on the specifics,<em> Champions</em> appears to a game focused solely on battling. Players will be able to import their pokémon from <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> or <em>Violet</em>, Pokémon Home, and other games into<em> Champions</em> to use in battles against players around the world. There are restrictions, however, on the pokémon you can use. The fine print says that not every pokémon available in Home and elsewhere will be available in <em>Champions</em> and those obtained in <em>Champions</em> cannot be ported back to Home.</p><p>It seems like <em>Champions</em> is a gamified version of the online battle simulators competitive <em>Pokémon</em> players use to test team composition and monster builds. The Pokémon Company was specific in that the game is coming to “the Nintendo Switch family of systems,” indicating this game might make an appearance on the forthcoming Switch 2. It’s also coming to Android and iOS.</p><p><em>Pokémon</em> is a very malleable franchise, able to fit a wide variety of game genres that The Pokémon Company seems keen to experiment with.

(Anybody remember <em>Pokémon Conquest</em>, the strategy RPG that was essentially Pikachu meets <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition</em>?) With <em>Pokémon Champions</em>, The Pokémon Company has found yet another way to reach gamers outside of its core games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ukraine-based independent games studio Reburn have just announced a new shooter, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, which I would summarise as Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> playing kiss-chase in the near-future jungles and neon sprawls of Latin America. It’s got world and narrative writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn, and is playable in single player with three-person co-op support. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
Who are Reburn exactly? Apparently, they’re a rebrand of former Metro developers 4A Games Ukraine, with 110 people on the books including “lead gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, programmers, and more from across the entire Metro series”. The project lead is  Sasha Kostiuk, who was gameplay and AI designer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> and Metro Last Light and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>. Reburn’s CEO and founder is Dmytro Lymar, previously director and CEO of 4A Games Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
While all this may seem quite cut-and-dried, there’s actually scope for some confusion about who and what is or isn’t 4A Games. I asked the PR for clarification and have now been educated. To briskly recap, 4A Games began life in Ukraine back in 2006, working on Metro 2033. In 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta in response to political instability in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The two studios retained close connections, however, agreeing to share the 4A Games trademark and 4A’s engine technology. They collaborated on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>. Then, in 2020, celebrated mass-redundancy peddlers Embracer bought 4A Games Malta. Around about the same time, 4A Games Ukraine got funding for an original project, La Quimera. Now, they’re working on it as a wholly separate outfit - though they’re keen, naturally, to cash in on their association with the Metro series.
</p>
<p>
Returning to La Quimera, it casts you as “a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier” with a customisable exosuit. “Fans of the Metro series will enjoy familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling combined with new game experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons,” comments the release.</p>
<p>My thoughts right now are 1) I get the gentlest frission of Gears Of War’s squad narrative from the quieter parts of the trailer, and 2) those guns are so wildly overfaceted I can’t decide which bit is the business end. It’s like they were crafted from Rubix cubes. The greebling appears to be eating the wielder's hands. I dread to think what graphics card adverts look like in La Quimera’s cyberpunk future.

Originally founded in 2006, the newly rechristened Reburn says that La Quimera will represent a big departure when compared to its work on Metro, and the studio describes the game as an action-packed first-person shooter with a "heavy focus" on narrative, world design, and characters. A release date has not yet been set for the game, but it is coming to PC.</p><p>The new game also features some Hollywood star power, as its world and narrative has been created and written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) alongside Reburn's EJA Warren. A combination of Latin-American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera can be played either in single-player or with two other people in its co-op mode. La Quimera puts players inside the exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier, and it'll feature both metropolitan and jungle settings to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” Reburn CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said in a press release. "We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight."</p><h2>La Quimera screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449822,1300-4449823,1300-4449824,1300-4449825,1300-4449826,1300-4449827,1300-4449828,1300-4449829,1300-4449830,1300-4449831,1300-4449832,1300-4449833,1300-4449834,1300-4449835" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"></figure><p>Prior to its rebranding to Reburn, 4A Games became notable over the years for its adaptations of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro books. So far, three mainline Metro games have been released, with the most recent one being 2019's Metro Exodus. A VR spin-off called Metro Awakening also arrived last year.</p>

                <p>Velan Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a> will be taking hide-and-seek into some lethal places on the game's new early-access launch date, March 13. This first-person shooter places 1-6 players on equal ground by forcing them to explore Wormwood Manor in complete darkness except for their flashlights and the flicker of light when a gun is fired. But things are going to get even wilder with two new gameplay modes.</p><p>Within Midnight Murder Club's new Wildcards mode, the battle royale in the mansion is upended by cards that can rewrite the laws of reality around them. When players pick cards from their collection, they can given special abilities like super speed or the power to self-detonate upon death. Some of those powers will extend to the other players in the match as well. At the end of each battle, players are given new cards to experiment with as they embrace the chaos around them.</p><p>The Guest Pass Edition doesn't change the actual gameplay like the Wildcards mode, but it does let additional players join in even if they don't own a copy of the game. As long as at least one person owns Midnight Murder Club, they can invite five other people to play the game for free. Presumably the Guest Pass Edition will also be available with the game's other modes, including Free for All, Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, and Headhunters.</p><p>Players can purchase the full game for approximately $20, and the Guest Pass Edition will be available on day one for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Presents arrives each year on the 27th February to celebrate the original release of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green in Japan and give fans a glimpse of what The Pokémon Company is up to.</p>
<p>This year we finally got a look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gameplay, as well as the brand-new Pokémon Champions mobile and Switch game. There's also plenty coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, and the cute Netflix show Pokémon Concierge will return.</p>
<p>The presentation was a bit light on details, but with next year being Pokémon's 30th anniversary, we can likely expect a bigger celebration in 2026.</p>
<p>Here's everything shown at this year's Pokémon Presents.</p>

<p>The big announcement we were all waiting for came at the end of the presentation, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">first look at Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay</a> (presumably <em>not </em>running on a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>). Set in the Kalos region's Paris-esque Lumiose City, it continues the action-RPG style from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-walkthrough-guide-missions-objectives-8039">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> but now in an urban setting.</p>
<p>The city is undergoing a high-tech urban redevelopment plan so humans and pokémon can live in harmony, with inner-city Wild Zones to catch 'mon in real time. There will be a new style of battling based on positioning and timing; Mega Evolutions will be included; and your first partner pokémon will be a choice of Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile.</p>
<p>It's set for release in late 2025, potentially teeing up a battle with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p>Now in development for the Switch "family of systems", plus iOS and Android, Pokémon Champions is a brand new game focused solely on Pokémon battles, with the aim of bringing them to a global audience to be enjoyed by everyone. Not much was shown but the battle focus sounds similar to the old Pokémon Stadium games. It will connect with Pokémon Home too, so you can use your caught Pokémon from the likes of Pokémon Go, or Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It's being developed by subsidiary The Pokémon Works (with Game Freak overseeing).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">new booster pack for the mobile trading card game will be added tomorrow</a>, 28th February. It's called Triumphant Light, is headlined by Arceus EX, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-leaks">unfortunately its existence leaked yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>What <em>is </em>new, though, is that Ranked Matches will be added at the end of March for those into the competitive battle scene. Further, Mega Evolution is also coming in 2025, with Mega Lucario EX and Mega Gardevoir EX cards shown.</p>

True to form, that's exactly what we got today, and here's everything that was announced during said showcase!</p>

<hr><h2>New episodes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>are on the way</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=UJGGkGeW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=AngXE7QU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>episodes are coming in September.</figcaption></figure><p>To kick the show off, The Pokemon Company announced new episodes of the charming stop-motion animation&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em>. They're set to air via Netflix in September, and you can watch the first four episodes of the show for free via YouTube from now until March 9th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour: Unova - Global coming this weekend</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a look at the next&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour, which is happening this weekend. It'll see Black Kyurem and White Kyurem appearing in Raid Battles, and you'll also get the chance to get your hands on Victini and a shiny Meloetta.</p>

<h2>Mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements are go</h2>

<p>Three mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles got updates next, namely&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<p>In the former, Champion May and her shiny Primal Kyogre, as well as Champion Brendan and his shiny Primal Groudon, will be making an appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix&nbsp;</em>is getting a new apple-themed menu item along with appearances from Flapple and Appletun, while a new Cresselia versus Darkrai event is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>fighters announced</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=2Lo2DDvE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=OrhC4s9w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three new fighters have been revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new Pokemon were announced for the MOBA&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune is coming to the game on March 1st, followed by Alolan Raichu in April and Alcremie later in the year.</p>

<p>What's more, the game will also see the return of the Remoat Stadium map, as well as a brand new mode called First to 500, which will reward you with unique battle effects when reaching certain point thresholds.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Triumphant Light set revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=TO6J_eU9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=g_fQUaSE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new set is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The next major expansion set for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been revealed in the form of Triumphant Light, and this one looks like it's themed around the deific Pokemon Arceus, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a> was built around Dialga and Palkia.</p>

<p>Cards include new Eevee, Magnemite, and Golbat variations, as well as a rather pretty Arceus ex card, a full-art Shaymin, and a pretty sweet-looking shiny Raichu. The set launches tomorrow.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions</h2>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon are coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>&nbsp;this year! The trailer showed off some snazzy-looking ex cards for Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but it didn't reveal a release date for the new feature.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>is getting some fun stuff</h2>

<p>If you're still playing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, you'll be pleased to know that you can grab yourself a nifty-looking Rotom Phone cover for each game. Simply input SB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and VB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Violet&nbsp;</em>(those are zeroes, not Os).</p>

<p>New Tera Raid Battles for Meowscarada, Skeledirge, and Quaquaval are also coming on February 28th, March 7th, and March 14th, respectively, with more (including Metagross, Garchomp, and Dragapult) on the way in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>brings battling to Switch and mobiles</h2>




<p>Next up, The Pokemon Company announced a new game called&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Stadium</em>-style game with an emphasis on battling.</p>

<p>The game will connect to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Home</em>, allowing you to use 'mons you've teamed up with in your games to battle trainers around the world. This one's coming to Switch and mobile devices, although we don't know when yet.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>coming "late 2025", new gameplay revealed</h2>




<p>Finally, we got to see some new info about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and we now know roughly when to expect the game as well, although certain details still seem conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a Lumiose City currently undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" in order to "turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share".</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely take place within the confines of the city, and you'll find Wild Zones inside Lumiose where Pokemon live. That's where you'll be doing the majority of your catching and battling, too.</p>

<p>During the trailer, The Pokemon Company introduced some of the fun characters you'll meet in&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>, including two new friendly rivals, Urbain or Taunie, one of whom you'll meet (seemingly based on the gender you pick).</p>

<p>We also got a new look at combat in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and it comes with a brand new feature in the form of areas of effect for moves; Rollout, for instance, hits in a straight line, while Rock Slide hits across a wide area. You'll have to dodge alongside your Pokemon to keep up.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>launches in late 2025 for Switch, but we didn't get a specific release date, nor did we learn whether the game will be coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Ho hum.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything revealed during today's Pokemon Presents showcase! Stay tuned for more on all other things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related.</p>

It’s Pokémon Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the launch of the original <em>Pokemon Red</em> and <em>Green </em>in Japan in 1996. Each year, The Pokémon Company puts on a livestream to talk about upcoming games, updates on current ones, and other projects within the franchise. Last year’s was a little lowkey because it was the first year in a while that Game Freak didn’t release a new RPG or DLC, but this year, the studio is releasing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the second installment in the <em>Legends </em>subseries set in Kalos. That wasn’t the only announcement, although things were still pretty quiet. If you want to watch the full livestream, you can check that out below.

Not much is known about their appearance, but they’re both known for being able to affect dreams and nightmares, so they’re appropriate for a sleep app.</p></div><div><p>Three new Pokemon are coming to the MOBA <em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune, Alolan Raichu, and Alcremie are all joining the roster in March, April, and “soon,” respectively. Also, a new mode called First to 500 is coming, which requires either team to reach 500 points through scoring goals.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-arceus-leak-rank-1851766589">As previously leaked</a></span>, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is getting a new booster set called Triumphant Light.

The only two we saw were Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but more will be added, as well.</p></div><div><p>After some updates on some small events in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, we got into a brand new game called <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The Switch and mobile game was only shown through a cinematic teaser, but it was described as a core-style battle simulator outside of the typical RPG structure. It’s being developed by Pokémon Works, and will let you connect to <em>Pokémon Home</em> to import your parties from mainline games.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. The Switch RPG deviates from <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, in that it takes place in modern day Kalos, rather than a historical setting. Your character will start their journey with either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig, while Lumiose City is undergoing an urban redevelopment plan. There will be discreet wild areas where you can capture more Pokémon, but it doesn’t seem like <em>Z-A</em> will include the open zones of <em>Arceus</em>. The game will launch on Switch in late 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before today, all we knew about the Switch game was what was revealed on Pokémon Day 2024. <em>Legends Z-A</em> is set entirely in the Kalos metropolis of Lumiose City, which debuted in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em> back in 2013. Now, we’ve finally seen the game in motion and, despite sharing the <em>Legends</em> name, it seems like a far cry from <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ open-zone structure.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unlike the countryside setting of the past game, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>revolves around Lumiose City which is currently undergoing a major urban renewal program with new construction and skyscrapers going up. More importantly, players will get to choose from Gen 2 and Gen 5 starters Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile during their adventures. The hybrid turn-based combat also looks a bitt different this time around. The game won’t arrive until late 2025.</p><p>One of the major mechanics in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>is the return of Mega Evolution. These superpowered forms transform regular fully-evolved critters into somewhat overdesigned versions of themselves for a hefty (but temporary) stat boost. It’s unclear if we’ll be getting new Mega Evolutions in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, however.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is probably one of the last <em>Pokémon </em>RPGs that will be developed for the Switch before the Switch 2 launches later this year. However, it will also be playable on the new device, which will play original Switch games through backward compatibility. So maybe we’ll see it running on the more powerful hardware when Nintendo holds a dedicated Direct presentation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After being initally leaked, both the new Triumphant Light A2A Set and Ranked Battles have been confirmed to arrive in Pokémon TCG Pocket—and their debut is very soon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> A2A aptly came to light on Febraury 27 when a leak revealed the new set. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 Pokémon Presents</a> presentation confirmed that it’s a brand-new mini-set—like Mythical Island—and features an array of news cards and ex beasts.</p>



<p>If this wasn’t enough, the also-leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-adding-ranked-battles-very-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battle</a> system is also official. It is expected to be a way for Pocket players to flex their best decks in a competitive environment.</p>



<h2 id="h-triumphant-light-amp-ranked-battles-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Triumphant Light &amp; Ranked Battles Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New possibilities await. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The February 205 Pokémon Presents showcase unveiled a ton of cool content across the company’s vast selection of mobile and console titles. But <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/?pubDate=20250225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> fans have been hearing murmurs about game-chaning features and content updates for a while now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Set A2A</a> was leaked a while back, and now we’ve seen it all for ourselves. The debut trailer is the usual eye-candy of shiny new cards and special Pokémon that will be hard to get. There’s likely to be new Events, Drops, and more Solo Battles to contend with too.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Ranked Battles will be added to test decks, skill, and as we all know—a bit of luck here and there too! </p>



<p>The showcase didn’t go too deep into the system’s details, but I’d expect a league-based system based on skill ratings like most Ranked Modes. The more matches you win, the higher you ascend up the ranks, the better your rewards are, and the sterner the opposition.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Triumphant Light trailer for yourself right here.</p>

    <p><span>An extended look at the world and gameplay.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Pokemon Legends: Z-A [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> in late 2025, publisher <a title="Companies > The Pokemon Company [405 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-pokemon-company">The Pokemon Company</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Game Freak [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/game-freak">Game Freak</a> announced. <span id="more-946962"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a> Legends Z-A</em> is a new title in the <em>Pokemon</em> series.</p><p>The story takes place in Lumiose City, the largest city in the Kalos region. Prism Tower stands tall at the center of this city of beautiful vistas. These days, Lumiose is undergoing a high-tech urban redevelopment plan to turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share.</p><p>After you arrive in Lumiose City to see the sights, you’ll meet three Pokemon, one of which will become your first partner—Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile. You’ll choose one of these Pokemon to accompany you on a new journey as you get to know Lumiose City and its inhabitants.</p><p>When you arrive in Lumiose, you’ll meet a new friend and ally—either Urbane or Tawny. The hotel where you’ll be staying is run by AZ. You’ll also meet his partner, Floette. Lumiose’s redevelopment is being managed by Quizartico Inc. You’ll become acquainted with the company’s CEO Jet and her secretary, Vinny. The different people you meet will make your time in Lumiose all the richer.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To help people and Pokemon coexist, the city has set up Wild Zones. These areas, located throughout Lumiose, give wild Pokemon habitats where they can thrive. To catch one of these wild Pokemon, aim carefully, then throw a Poke Ball. If you’re having a hard time catching one, have one of your Pokemon use its moves to weaken the target, making it easier to catch.</p><p>This game offers a style of Pokemon battling not seen in previous titles. Moves can have a longer or shorter reach, or different areas of effect, so choose your timing and positioning carefully to gain the upper hand. Lead your partner Pokemon through battles and dodge incoming attacks. Swap Pokemon if you need to and find the right moment to unleash a move.</p><p>What’s more, certain Pokemon can go beyond evolution by undergoing Mega Evolution. When a trainer’s keystone resonates with the Mega Stone held by their Pokemon, the Pokemon will do more than just change shape. It’ll unlock a new level of power, turning the tide of battle in its favor.</p><p>As Lumiose continues its transformation into a city that belongs to both people and Pokemon, who knows what kinds of encounters and experiences will await you.</p></blockquote><p>More information is available via the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

                <p dir="ltr">Today is Pokemon Day, the annual celebration of the original Pokemon games--Red and Green--releasing in Japan. With it comes a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/" data-ref-id="2900-6286">Pokemon Presents video</a>, and today's ended with a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with a release window of "late 2025."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Z-A will take Trainers on a tour of Lumiose City, the bustling Paris-themed city from Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, which in this game is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment" by a company called Quasartico for both people and Pokemon to enjoy. The city will feature multiple open areas for exploration, including rooftops--which players can jump off and glide back down to the ground--and Wild Zones where new Pokemon can be battled and caught.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_KNDtKJJ-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We see multiple Pokemon encounters during the trailer, some of which resemble the turn-based battling featured in many previous games, as well as the "throw a Poke Ball without battling" mechanic seen in Legends: Arceus. Along with those came a new type of battling system where distance and movement play a key role, as attack moves have a certain amount of reach, and moving a Pokemon out of the way will cause the attack to miss.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A will also mark the return of Mega Evolutions--which originated in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo DS. Multiple Mega Pokemon are shown in the trailer, including Mega Lucario, Mega Ampharos, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also introduced many of the characters inhabiting this version of Lumiose City, which include both new and returning faces. We see the player character's friends Urbain and Taunie, Quasartico CEO Jett and her bodyguard Vinnie, and the return of AZ--the mysterious former king of Kalos--as the owner of the hotel the player-characters stays in during the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A is the second installment of the Pokemon Legends franchise, as it follows 2022's Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It is scheduled to release in late 2025.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was a huge success for the company, and the franchise is coming back this year with potentially even more features that the studio didn't get into 2024's game.</p><p>EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p><p>For CFB 25, many people mentioned how the single-player career mode, Road to Glory, felt underwhelming, so that's one area that fans will hope to see expanded upon in 2025's game.</p><p>CFB 25 came to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not PC. Sources told The Athletic that CFB 25 skipped PC due in part to how the game's primary audience is in North America, whereas launching on PC is more important for global releases. Holt said EA "started" with Xbox and PlayStation, but said, "We'll look at other opportunities, other platforms" for future releases.</p><p>EA never disclosed a sales number for CFB 25, but it was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>, only eclipsed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Holt said the game "outperformed all our expectations" and became "part of the cultural landscape of college football."</p><p>Another change for CFB 26 could be how much the student-athletes are paid to be part of it. The original deal for CFB 25 was a payment of $600 and a free copy of the game to more than 11,000 players, amounting to a total cost of more than $6 million for EA. Some players got more money for promoting the game. For CFB 26, a Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) company called Pathway Sports &amp; Entertainment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">attempting to sign players with $1,500 up front with the potential for a revenue-sharing deal as well</a> based on copies sold. EA has not commented on Pathway's proposed plans.</p>

                <p>Capcom has revealed the release window of Title Update 1 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and teased some of what players can expect from it. Specifically, it looks like more content is coming to the game for players who beat the story and want more of a challenge.</p><p>Title Update 1 will come out in early April, placing its launch over a month after the base game's release. That might seem like a big gap between launch and the first update, but the official Monster Hunter X account explains that Capcom wanted to "give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them!" Capcom had previously teased this update with a vague Spring 2025 release window <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">during a State of Play</a> earlier this month.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1895092830176952494" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Title Update 1 – Release Date!</p><p> We’re pleased to confirm that TU1 for Monster Hunter Wilds will arrive in early April! <br>This will give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them! <a href="https://t.co/xbbPY2z5B9" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xbbPY2z5B9</a></p></div>  — Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1895092830176952494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the most approachable games in the series yet, Capcom will also add more-difficult monsters in TItle Update 1. There will be two new monsters for players to hunt, including one with strength "at a level above Tempered." During the State of Play, it was confirmed that Mizutsune from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-generations/" data-ref-id="5000-433646">Monster Hunter Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a> will be one of these monsters.</p><p>Capcom also <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1895097872502190478" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased on X</a> that this update will add "a new place to communicate, have meals together, and more with other hunters," although it clarified that players will have to complete Monster Hunter Wilds' story before they can access this. With this addition and those tough new monsters, Title Update 1 looks like it will strengthen the endgame of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p>You can start playing the game and preparing for Title Update 1 yourself when Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S tomorrow, February 28.</p>

Today brought our first look at gameplay footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">the Pokémon Presents presentation</a> - as well as a narrowed release window for the Switch 1 game.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive in "late 2025", it was revealed - a little later than some were expecting. No mention at all was made of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in late 2025," said Takato Utsunomiya, chief operating officer of The Pokémon Company. "We hope everybody can wait just a little longer for their adventures in Lumiose City to begin."

<p>As we knew already, Pokémon Legends Z-A was shown to be an action RPG spin-off from the series' main games set in a redesigned version of Lumiose City, the Kalos region's Parisian-inspired metropolis. The action looks set to take place entirely within the city limits, though there are rooftops to explore and suburban wild areas with roaming Pokémon.</p>
<p>These areas, gated by green neon fences, contain various familiar creatures inside. Today's trailer showed off Buneary, Spewpa, Fletchling, Sandile and more. Numerous other species can be seen alongside humans in the game's other areas - this surburban setting filled with Pokémon reminiscent of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a> games.</p>
<p>Today's trailer was devoid of any new Pokémon species or Mega Evolutions, though it did at least confirm the three Starter Pokémon you'll use in the game: Gold and Silver's Grass-type Chikorita and Water-type croc Totodile, plus Black and White's fire hog Tepig.

<p>Presumably the evolved versions of all three will get to Mega Evolve - though we didn't see that today. This new footage did at least confirm what was hinted at last year, which was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-futuristic-in-2025">the Kalos region's Mega Evolution mechanic is back in Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> and will work in the same way - with select Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution requiring a Mega Stone.</p>
<p>Also on show was a new battle system, where it looks like you can lead your monster around the battlefield, and where attacks will differ in power based on their range.</p>
<p>As for the game's main plotline, the city is being redeveloped by the Quasartico Inc. company, whose bosses are clearly Bad Guys. You team up with a mystical-looking old dude named "AZ" who runs the hotel in which you stay. Legendary Pokémon Zygarde appears briefly, as does one of its individual cells, though nothing more of its involvement is confirmed.</p>
<p>There's plenty we're still to find out about Pokémon Legends Z-A - and perhaps it made sense for today's first look at gameplay to hold back some of the details, since there's still at least six months until it arrives. What  were your first impressions?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
