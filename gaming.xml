            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The earliest known cartridge copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, which may also be the iconic platformer's master copy, is going up for auction next month, with the proceeds entirely going to benefit a major gaming preservation charity.</p>

<p>Auction house <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6566468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christie's</a> will play host to the auction, in which a 1985-era&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>cartridge will be up for grabs. The price will be pretty steep, though; Christie's estimates the cart will cost you somewhere in the region of £100,000 to £150,000 (about $130,000 to $200,000).</p>

<p>The auction is being held to benefit the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF), a charity organization that's involved with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">preserving</a> some of the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-computer-entertainer" rel="nofollow">important</a> (and esoteric!) artifacts from throughout gaming history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=5q1pvI1f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=SeT4JrqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It may not look like much, but this could be the master copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The Video Game History Foundation says that this cartridge was created at Nintendo before mass production on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>began, and that while the charity can't be certain, "it is possible that this was the original master copy of the game", i.e. the one on which all retail copies were based.</p>

<p>Of course, given the cartridge's age, it's possible that the game wouldn't work if you were to slot it into a Famicom console, but I don't suppose anyone picking this up will be buying it so they can play&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>; it's more of a collector's item.</p>

<p>This is far from the first&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-related retro gaming auction. During 2021 alone, two&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-sells-for-over-600k-at-auction" rel="nofollow">cartridges</a> sold for eye-watering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-copy-sells-for-record-breaking-price" rel="nofollow">amounts</a>, and other games in the franchise have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-3-most-expensive-game-ever-sold" rel="nofollow">commanded incredible prices</a> at auction as well.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>itself, well, the game needs no introduction; as the Christie's lot essay for the above cartridge says, it's "the most influential video game of all time", or at least a strong contender for that title.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-brings-a-minigun-and-more-next-week.1364515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have announced Python Commandos, a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing an honest-to-god minigun and more next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Python Commandos launches on December 2nd (that's next Tuesday at time of writing), and as has been the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, you can expect new weapons, new armor, and new emotes to bring with you into the field.</p>

<p>First off, the M-1000 Maxigun is a belt-fed, ultra-high-capacity minigun that should let you tear through bugs, bots, and whatever else gets in your way with aplomb. Just try not to turn it on your teammates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Z7NgMf0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Uhnai22j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond has a minigun for you to lay waste to your enemies with.</figcaption></figure><p>A new Guard Dog drone equipped with a flamethrower is also being added, but once again, you'll need to make sure it doesn't accidentally set your teammates on fire (or perhaps they'll need to make sure they're not in its way).</p>

<p>Hacking your way through&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s jungles just got a lot easier, too, as the aptly-named CQC-9 Defoliation Tool (which, yes, is basically a machete) can cut through everything, be it brush, bugs, or, uh, buddies.</p>

<p>You can also get to grips with a brand new primary weapon in Python Commandos, namely the AR/GL-21 One-Two, a "combination assault rifle and grenade launcher" that lets you switch between these two modes depending on what you need.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to brand new armor sets with a passive that makes your Helldiver harder to ragdoll, as well as two new capes, a new emote, and a brand new camo pattern for your gear.</p>




<p>You'll be able to get your hands on <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s Python Commandos Warbond when it arrives across all platforms on December 2nd. The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">review right here</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This week’s most popular game is not a robovoiced extraction shooter or a buggy martial arts RPG, but Guess The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> Price: a well-meaning (if largely speculative) timepasser wherein whoever most accurately converts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-confirm-the-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-with-similar-specs-rather-than-a-console">Valve’s teasing</a> into a final street price for the resurrected SteamOS mini-PC wins. In 2026, when it launches.</p>
<p>I feel left out, so will have a go myself below, though there’s quite a serious kink in mine or indeed anyone’s plan to ticket the Steam Machine by speccing an equivalent DIY PC. Alas, RAM prices have gone stratospheric, in a manner not seen among computing components since the Great Graphics Card Dumpster Fire of 2020.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As then, but now, the cause is an industry-wide shortage, only this time trigged by – <em>you again</em> – artificial intelligence. In short, AI data centres are rapidly expanding, eating up memory output and leaving scant RAM supplies for consumer PC building. What’s left has, broadly since October but this past week especially, been slapped with obscene markups: this unremarkable <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CTHXMYL8?th=1">Crucial DDR5 32GB</a> kit, for example, was £88 a month ago. Now it’s £206. A bog-standard Corsair Vengeance DDR5 32GB set? Was £100 in September, now yours for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CBRJ63RT?th=1">£350</a>. This premium 64GB kit was already pricey at £210, again back in September, and now sits at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0C5M9P5GK/">£557</a> – more than an RTX 5070, a base PS5, or 1,011 packets of M&amp;S extra cream Bourbon biscuits. 1,011! Makes me <em>sick</em>.</p>
<p>Hardware manufacturers can purchase at scale, and may have enough RAM sticks squirreled away to maintain production, potentially for the several months that shortages are expected to continue. But those who haven’t stockpiled parts will end up feeling the crunch – Microsoft are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">allegedly considering yet another price hike</a> for their Xbox Series X/S consoles to cover the higher memory costs.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>None of this bodes well for the Steam Machine. Worst case, Valve must pay top dollar for its DDR5 modules (these are smaller, laptop-style sticks rather than desktop DIMMs, but the type in question still appears affected) and bump up the Machine’s price to compensate. Best case, they have enough memory from the pre-crisis days for a more affordable launch. But, at some point that stock will run out, and Valve will need to choose between supplying more Steam Machines with this AI tax in play or wait it out while those digital shelves grow cobwebs.</p><p>For now, though, nobody actually knows what the situation will be in early 2026, likely including Valve themselves. Indeed, it wouldn’t be remotely surprising if fluctuating parts prices are among the reasons why they didn’t just announce pricing for the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> as part of the initial reveal. In any case, I wouldn’t put too much weight on anyone’s Steam Machine price estimates just because they’ve totted up the cost of a similar home-built PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s my Steam Machine price estimate, based on totting up the cost of a similar home-built PC. I’m specifically going for parts that would closely replicate the Steam Machine’s <em>performance</em>, based on my testing of it at Valve HQ last month, and not necessarily its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">on-paper specs</a>. Partly because it has something akin to a custom-built laptop CPU and nobody’s going to bother putting something like that in a DIY desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case:</strong> Lian Li A3 mATX Wood Edition (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEbNd" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank">£60</a>)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 7600X (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZM3rM" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank">£162</a>)</li>

<p>Hope that was helpful. It won't be. But I hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve is running a big Black Friday sale for the first time in Steam’s history. Normally, around this time of year, we get a Fall sale and a Winter sale. Now Valve has decided to join in with every other online retailer and treat Black Friday as a week-long sales event. But hey, cheaper games are always nice, especially when they are new releases.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/?flavor=contenthub_topsellers&amp;offset=74">Valve surprised many by announcing a large Black Friday sale</a> on its hugely popular PC gaming storefront, Steam. The sale runs from now until December 1 and features a large list of games across basically every genre and sub-genre you can imagine. Better yet, a lot of the discounted games include titles, both big and small, that launched in 2025.</p>

 <p>For example, you can grab <em>Battlefield 6,</em> one of the biggest games this year, for $10 less than usual. If you are looking for something big to sink into over Thanksgiving, the remastered <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> is just $34 this week. Or maybe you want some puzzles to solve with your family and friends? Well, good news: <em>Blue Prince</em> is discounted to just $20 during Steam’s big sale. And if you crave a fun zombie game, this year’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is excellent and even better at $45.</p>

 <p>And it’s not just games that are on sale. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-black-friday-sale-discount-pc-gaming-2000647222">Valve has also marked down the Steam Deck, too.</a> You can get the base LCD model for $80 less than usual. It might be a bit old now, but the Steam Deck is still a damn fine way to play most indie games and smaller titles in 2025.</p> <p>Of course, with a sale this big, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> want to help you find a good deal. So our crack team of experts (me) used advanced algorithms (I spent an hour digging through deals) to assemble a handy database of big discounts worth checking out. (I made a list for you.)</p>  <ul> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 2026</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Of Ash &amp; Steel</em> – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $34 ($50)</li> <li><em>Blue Prince</em> – $20 ($30)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – $25 ($30)</li> <li><em>Dying Light The Beast</em> – $45 ($60)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>– $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Hellclock</em> – $14 ($20)</li> <li><em>Mars First Logistics</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Metal Eden</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Wildgate</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Camper Van: Make It Home</em> – $11 ($15)</li> <li><em>Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> – $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Time Flies</em> – $12 ($15)</li> <li><em>to a T</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Tron Catalyst</em> – $17 ($25)</li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> – $70 ($35)</li> <li><em>Jackbox Party Pack 11</em> – $24 ($30)</li> </ul>

              <p>Following the success of the Steam Deck PC gaming handheld, Valve announce an all-new lineup of gaming hardware including a Steam Controller, a VR kit called the Steam Frame, and the Steam Machine. The last of those is a retread of Valve’s attempt at having a home gaming console, but the company is in a much better position to be an Xbox killer now given current hardware capabilities along with the work put in to make the Steam OS into what it is now. That said, the big question is price. We currently have no clue what it will sell for nor when it will come out. So if you’re aching to get some gaming in right now, maybe go with a gaming laptop.</p>

The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even harder</a>—which was brutal—and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first expansion was revealed.</a> The developer has no intention for you to go outside and see the light anytime soon.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The night never ends. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC is currently scheduled to release on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>This would be quite apt as it would be nearly one year on from Nightreign’s announcement at The Game Awards 2024. With no word on how much content Nightreign is expected to get—especially with FromSoftware resources being diverted to The Duskbloods—this could end up being the only major DLC expansion for Nightreign.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated if any late announcements indicate a delay to The Forspoken Hollows.</p>







<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc">Everything Included In Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC</h2>



<p><strong>Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC includes new playable characters, new bosses, a new Shifting Earth, and much more on top of this.</strong></p>



<p>FromSoftware is a master of its craft. It doesn’t short-change gamers and constantly provides value for money. These are the full details that have been provided for The Forspoken Hollows DLC so far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This product is an additional&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;for&nbsp;ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. It includes&nbsp;2 additional Nightfarers,&nbsp;2 new Bosses, and&nbsp;1 new Shifting Earth, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are <strong>Scholar </strong>and <strong>Undertaker</strong>. Here’s a brief explainer provided for each new character:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> “An&nbsp;academic&nbsp;who walks the&nbsp;Lands Between.&nbsp;Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.”</li>



<li><strong>Undertaker:</strong> “An&nbsp;abbess&nbsp;who was mandated to slay the&nbsp;Nightlord.&nbsp;Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the Shifting Earth brings about gorgeous crystals in an enchanting locale. The rest remains to be seen on December 4. As usual, the content is playable on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>You can see tidbits of new content and a snippet of what’s to come in the official gameplay reveal trailer for the DLC expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie horror game Horses is preparing to launch on December 2 on the Epic Games Store, GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store. But one place it won't be is on Steam, because Steam has banned the game for, according to the developer, reasons that remain unclear even after two years of back-and-forth with Valve. And according to the developer, this ban seems likely to result in the shutdown of their entire studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with Pietro Righi Riva of Italian studio Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, Wheels of Aurelia, MirrorMoon EP), who explained their side of the story. According to Riva and a <a href="https://horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed FAQ</a> shared with IGN, Santa Ragione first submitted Horses to Steam in 2023, when the game was in a <em>very</em> unfinished state. "We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam’s request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before," Riva explains. It was at this stage that Valve rejected the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Riva goes on to say that Valve did not offer any explanation as to why the game was rejected, nor was there any opportunity for the team to change whatever the offending content was. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get anyone at Valve to work with them to reverse the decision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Steam’s decision came without detailed feedback, and the ban notice did not cite any specific scenes or elements," Riva says. "For months we repeatedly asked what triggered the ban and received no answer. We also offered, unsuccessfully, to change any content deemed unfit, especially since the game was still early in development at the time of submission."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Chasing Wild Horses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So what triggered the ban? Riva still doesn't know. While minds may jump to Steam's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-censorship-of-adult-games-highlights-how-payment-processors-wield-immense-power-that-even-nations-cant-control-says-japanese-politician">recent banning of a number of adult games</a> to comply with sudden crackdowns from payment processors, Riva says this ban took place long before that was even a conversation, and all the content in the game is fully legal. He does have a theory, though. The automated review sent by Steam in 2023 included a link to <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, as well as the following sentence: "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses, Riva says, does not contain any such content. All characters in the game are older than 20 "as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game." He also asserts that the game is not pornographic. It is, per the studio, "about the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility." From the FAQ sent to IGN:</p><blockquote>While it does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content. (We apologize if we got your hopes up for horse porn.)</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What Riva thinks triggered the ban is a scene that existed in the game during the initial Steam submission, where a man and his young daughter visit the farm. As the FAQ explains:</p><blockquote>The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the “horses” are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one. What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag. We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Riva says he has tried everything. He has tried speaking to contacts at Valve who had previously worked with the studio on past games. According to him, they claimed not to know the specific reasons for the ban and said it would not be possible to find out and tell them. He's reached out to Valve again and again, but has yet to receive any official explanation of what content was offensive, nor an opportunity to resubmit it without that content. IGN also reached out to Valve for comment for this piece, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Riva also says he's had no issues with any other platform: GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store had no issues with it. Epic asked the studio to update just the screenshots on the game's store page so as not to include nudity, which Riva says they complied with, and the game was accepted. As for consoles, he says he's shown the game to console partners and hasn't heard any concerns about content. Horses also has received PEGI and ESRB ratings that would be required for console distribution. "The only reason we haven't actively started porting the game is lack of funds."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Reining It In</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Horses is unsettling to say the <em>least</em>. I watched a colleague play some of it at a demo at Day of the Devs in 2023, and it's not for the faint of heart. It's about a young man who comes to a farm to work a summer job caring for horses, only to discover the horses are actually naked adult humans wearing horse head masks, chained up in the yard. Snippets from trailers show the "horses" watching what seems to be horse propaganda, being ridden by other people by carrying them on their shoulders, being fed carrots, and being on the receiving end of humiliation and violence. It challenges the player to either accept what they're seeing and continue to participate in it, or try to subvert what's going on at the horse farm, a process that seems like it will be utterly terrifying and unpleasant in some way. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Santa Ragione also has a solid track record of making and publishing artistic, esoteric, disturbing games with poignant messages, many of which have been up for awards for that very reason. Their board game Escape From The Aliens In Outer Space was nominated for the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. MirrorMoon EP was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the Independent Games Festival after its launch in 2013. More recently, in 2024, Santa Ragione published Mediterranea Inferno, which won the Excellence in Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival. And Mediterranea Inferno is just one of a handful of games published by Santa Ragione as part of its efforts to promote the work of up-and-coming Italian creators, with Horses being another example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again from the FAQ:</p><blockquote>We are committed to producing challenging, adult storytelling. Horses uses grotesque, subversive imagery to confront power, faith, and violence. We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of “decency” were used to silence artists. Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions. Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art. Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, the verdict stands. Riva and Santa Ragione are stuck: one week until launch, and no ability to publish their game on the most massive PC storefront in existence. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Long Faces</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Riva, the inability to release on Steam almost certainly means that Santa Ragione is done for. The studio already was struggling with financial troubles: it initially invested $50,000 when they signed the game with its creator, Andrea Lucco Borlera. They were hoping that sales of the team's previous game, Saturnalia, would help make that money back, but it didn't do as well as they'd hoped. Riva says they even lined up "a great bundle opportunity" for Saturnalia, but had to cancel it when Valve refused to give them Steam keys for again unclear reasons.</p><blockquote>Around the same time, we were informed that Horses had been banned and would not release on Steam, which completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable. After two years of seeking these funds through traditional venues while trying to get the game unbanned, we had to seek private funding from friends to complete development, which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopeless as this seems, Riva isn't closed to the possibility that Santa Ragione could be saved. He says if it manages to sell "tens of thousands of copies" without being on Steam, they'd be able to break even and keep working on future projects. But he's not banking on that. Ideally, he says, Valve would revert its decision and reconsider the game, but after two years, that doesn't seem likely to happen either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Riva says their team won't fully disappear from gaming. The team has funds set aside for six months to support Horses post-launch with bug fixes and quality of life updates. Riva also tells me that the studio has known this was a possibility for a while now, and has been preparing accordingly. Its members have all found other gigs, some of which are in games. Riva himself says he's always worked multiple jobs in teaching, consulting, and curation while directing Santa Ragione, so he plans to "do more of that." And Horses director Borlera is already pitching new projects elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Riva would love to see a miracle leading to Horses recouping its costs and saving the studio, he says what he actually wants more than anything is for Valve to be transparent about its policies on mature content, which have fluctuated over the years and never really been clear. From the FAQ:</p><blockquote>Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games; some of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating “All characters depicted are over the age of 18” in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog. This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">As a final word, Riva urges game developers to stand up together to demand transparency from Steam. "I know developers are understandably scared of voicing their complaints about Steam, but I hope we can collectively ask for better conditions to make our work more viable and more creatively free," he says. "The current landscape is one where very few actors control the distribution of almost all games that are produced, and that should mean they are responsible not just for the commercial sustainability of the industry, but also for the growth of games as an artistic medium."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valves-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-dont-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-don%E2%80%99t-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one.1364482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After Valve announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">its upcoming Steam Machine living room box</a> earlier this month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">some analysts suggested to Ars</a> that Valve could and should aggressively subsidize that hardware with “loss leader” pricing that leads to more revenue from improved Steam software sales. In <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">a new interview with YouTube channel Skill Up</a>, though, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais ruled out that kind of console-style pricing model, saying that the Steam Machine will be “more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market.”</p>
<p>Griffais said the AMD Zen 4 CPU and RDNA3 GPU in the Steam Machine were designed to outperform the bottom 70 percent of machines that opt-in to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Valve’s regular hardware survey</a>. And Steam Machine owners should expect to pay roughly what they would for desktop hardware with similar specs, he added.</p>
<p>“If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,” Griffais said.</p>
<p>The new comments follow similar sentiments relayed by Linus Sebastian on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo">a recent episode of his WAN Show podcast</a>. Sebastian said that, when talking to Valve representatives at a preview event, he suggested that a heavily subsidized price point would make the Steam Machine hardware into “a more meaningful product.” But when he suggested that he was imagining a console-style price in the range of $500, “nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great.”</p>
<h2>Forget about $500</h2>
<p>Based on these comments, we could start estimating a potential Steam Machine price range by speccing out a comparable desktop machine. That would likely require building around <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-7600x-ryzen-5-7000-series-raphael-zen-4-socket-am5/p/N82E16819113770">a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asrock-challenger-rx7600-cl-8go-radeon-rx-7600-8gb-graphics-card-double-fans/p/N82E16814930093">Radeon RX 7600 GPU</a>, which would probably push the overall build into the $700-plus range. That would make the Steam Machine competitive with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">the pricey PS5 Pro</a>, even though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oxg6r0/a_hardware_engineer_from_the_canal_moores_law/">some estimates</a> price out the actual internal Steam Machine components in the $400 to $500 range.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a> and Wheels of Aurelia developers Santa Ragione have announced that they will "wind down operations and face a high risk of closing the studio", following Valve's refusal to allow their upcoming horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> on Steam, PC gaming's largest digital storefront by some distance. They say they have the funds to support and update Horses after launch for around six months, but claim they "will not be able to start new projects unless Horses somehow recoups its development costs without access to more than 75% of the PC gaming market".
</p>
<p>
The studio have published <a href="https://horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">a FAQ on their official website</a> explaining the situation in depth. They claim that Valve rejected Horses based on an unfinished build from 2023, at which time Steam's approval teams commented that "this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute", with the specific addition that "we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor".
</p>
<p>
We'll return to that last line. Firstly, some context. Horses, if you've yet to have the displeasure, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-is-an-absolutely-cursed-horror-game-from-the-creators-of-saturnalia">an unholy cauldron of surreal body horror and silent cinema techniques</a>, now due to release via Epic, GOG, the Humble Store and Itch on 2nd December. It casts you as a young man who must spend two weeks working on an isolated farm. After meeting the Farmer - a lumpen gargoyle whose lips and teeth get far too much screentime - you're introduced to the titular Horses, who turn out to be naked human slaves in horse masks, their private parts blurred out.
</p>
<p>
Around two years ago, Santa Ragione submitted a "rough, incomplete" version of Horses for Steam approval. "We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam's request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before," the developers comment. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they received an "automated" review statement from Valve in June 2023, rejecting the game on the grounds that it infringed Steam's content policies. Find it in full below.
</p>
<blockquote>After review, we will not be able to ship your game HORSES on Steam. While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute. Regardless of a developer's intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor. While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation--even in a subtle way that could be defined as a 'grey area'--it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted.</blockquote>

<p>
The developers spent the following months asking for more details about the ban, while offering to change anything Valve deemed unfit for publication - something that would have been relatively straightforward, given that Horses was still being made at the time of Steam review submission. They say that Valve have yet to reply, but they believe Steam's content reviewers may have had misgivings about one particular scene when another man and his daughter visit the farm. 
</p><p>
"The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the "horses" are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one," the developers explain. "What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. 
</p>
<p>
"The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag," they continue. "We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character." 
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Santa Ragione</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The developers note that all characters in the game "are clearly older than 20 years old, as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game." They also comment that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." Valve have, of course, already rejected the argument from intent in their alleged statement above.
</p><p>
I've now played through Horses myself - look out for a review next week - and as regards the final version of the game, at least, nothing about the scene with the young woman strikes me as some kind of child pornography. It's disturbing material, but it's also very clearly a commentary on abuse and exploitation rather than an endorsement, with appropriate dialogue, and yes, the characters are depicted as adults (the young man protagonist is elsewhere described as 19 or 20 in a letter from his parents). Still, it's not clear that this is the scene that has triggered Valve's ire. We've mailed them to ask for comment on Santa Ragione's claims.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they have invested around $100,000 making Horses. The developers invested $50,000 initially after signing the game with its primary developer, Andrea Lucco Borlera, and had hoped to cover the remaining costs based on sales of their previous, very good horror game Saturnalia. The latter has not sold as well as hoped, however, something Santa Ragione attribute partly to Valve's refusal to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" - this came around the time they were told that Horses had been banned from Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say that the ban has "completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable". They have raised the remaining $50,000 via private funding from friends, "which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs". 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione perhaps merit some criticism on this last count - if you know that your videogame project is not "viable", isn't it more responsible to hedge your bets rather than continuing to raise funds? Still, I'm sympathetic to the developers' predicament otherwise.
</p><p>
Given that it dates back to 2023, the Horses ban pre-dates the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">swathe of "adult" game delistings</a> on Steam and Itch.io precipitated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a payment processor crackdown</a>. In their FAQ, Santa Ragione are careful to draw lines between the situation and wider efforts to restrict access to sexual material online.
</p>
<p>
"It's important to note that HORSES' ban has nothing to do with the recent restriction on adult content pushed by payment processors," they write. "This decision was solely in the hands of Steam's curatorial team." In other words, they're putting the blame for all this squarely on Valve. 
</p>
<p>
"Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games," the developers comment. "[S]ome of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating 'All characters depicted are over the age of 18' in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. 
</p>
<p>
"By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog," the developers go on. "This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art."
</p>
<p>
Again, we'll ask Valve for a comment.

              <p><strong>USB-C is now the universal norm for charging</strong> and data on everything from smartphones to tablets to laptops, ending the cable chaos that had plagued tech users for decades. Even Apple gave up its <em>Lightning</em> connectors in favor of USB-C across all devices so now <strong>everyone needs quality USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> for charging and syncing.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/">$6, down from $8, this Anker 2-pack works out to just $3 per cable for Apple-approved accessories</a> from a brand trusted by millions. This r<strong>ecord-low Black Friday price</strong> on Amazon makes stocking up on essential charging cables affordable enough to place them everywhere you need power.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>60W Fast Charging That Powers Real Devices</h2>
<p>The capability for <strong>60W power delivery manages fast charging for iPhones, iPads, MacBook Air</strong>&nbsp;and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocols without bottlenecking charging speeds. This wattage proves enough to charge most phones at maximum speed and also supports tablet and laptop charging at respectable rates that keep most devices powered during use.</p>
<p>An<strong> iPhone 16 or 17 will charge from empty to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> when paired with an appropriate 20W or higher charger, while an iPad will charge comfortably sans the frustratingly slow speeds that plague inadequate cables. The 60W rating provides headroom beyond what most phones require and ensures the cable never becomes the limiting factor in your charging setup even as devices demand more power in future generations.</p>



<p>The <strong>3.3-foot length strikes the practical balance</strong> between reach and portability that makes these cables work across multiple usage scenarios. This length extends comfortably from wall outlets to nightstands or desks without excess cable creating tangled messes, while remaining short enough to pack neatly in bags without bulky coils. Bedside charging reaches from floor outlets to mattress height with ease, office setups connect from desktop power strips to devices on desks, and car charging extends from dashboard ports to passenger seats.</p>
<p><strong>Apple’s approval from Anker</strong> offers the assurance of strict quality and safety standards that come inherently with the official compatibility certification process. What that means in real life is these cables will work seamlessly on your iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks without triggering any compatibility warnings or experiencing those frustrating connection issues like other, lesser, non-certified cables do. The extensive testing for electrical safety, data integrity, and durability makes sure such cables will not damage your expensive devices due to voltage irregularities or poor construction.</p>



<p>The two-pack quantity provides immediate redundancy by placing cables in several locations, rather than continually moving a single cable from room to room and risking loss or damage. Leave one cable at the side of your bed for overnight charging, using the second at the desk for daytime top-ups, or designate one for home and another for your work bag.</p>
<p>The fact that Anker is an Apple-approved accessory maker gives them a level of quality you just can’t get from some no-name cheap cables. If you want reliable USB-C cables without paying Apple’s premium pricing, this record-low deal makes essential charging infrastructure absurdly affordable.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="518">Have you upgraded your laptop recently? No? Well, if you’re still using a device that’s been around for like a decade, it might be time to consider replacing it. The 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is a fantastic, versatile option that can meet the needs of almost anyone—whether you’re a student, a small business owner, or simply someone looking for a more powerful device than using your phone for everything. Right now, you can save up to $450 on the 2024 model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/">This significant 38% discount brings the price down from $1,200 to as low as $750 for a limited time. And it’s not even officially Black Friday yet!</a></p>

<h2 data-start="520" data-end="557">Powerful Performance for Any Task</h2>
<p data-start="559" data-end="1248">The Microsoft Surface Laptop is built with performance in mind. It features a choice between two processors: the Snapdragon X Elite 10-core or 12-core CPU. The 12-core processor is especially impressive, delivering speed that even outpaces the MacBook Air’s M3 chip, ensuring smooth and fast performance for all kinds of tasks. Whether you’re tackling school assignments, handling business operations, or simply browsing the web, this laptop can keep up without a hitch. It also offers 16GB or 32GB of memory, ensuring smooth multitasking and the ability to run demanding applications. Additionally, the 512GB storage capacity provides ample room for all your files, photos, and documents.</p>
<p data-start="1250" data-end="1923">As expected with pretty much any tech product to release in the last couple years, the marketing for this laptop is leading with it’s support for AI features. Microsoft markets this Surface Laptop as built for the AI era, offering integration with Copilot+, which is their new AI assistant. Copilot+ can generate art from text prompts and help you easily access documents or websites. In addition to this, Copilot+ promises to improve video call quality by enhancing lighting, reducing background noise, and blurring distractions, though these features have been around for a while—just now labeled as AI.</p>


<h2 data-start="1925" data-end="1964">Stunning Display &amp; Versatile Design</h2>
<p data-start="1966" data-end="2748">The Surface Laptop boasts a large and vibrant display, available in 13.8-inch or 15-inch sizes. With HD resolution and support for HDR and DolbyVision IQ, the screen offers sharp visuals that bring all your content to life. Whether you’re watching videos, working on projects, or browsing, you can expect vibrant colors and clear details. The laptop also features a touchscreen, allowing you to easily switch between tablet mode for a more interactive experience or use it like a traditional laptop with the keyboard and mouse. The minimal bezel design maximizes the screen space.. Plus, it’s incredibly thin and lightweight, making it easy to carry between classes, work meetings, or perhaps your local coffee shop.</p>
<h2 data-start="2750" data-end="2805">Convenient Port Selection &amp; Impressive Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="2807" data-end="3264">In terms of connectivity, the Microsoft Surface Laptop comes equipped with all the necessary ports, including two USB-C 4 ports for fast data transfer and charging. The laptop is also designed to be highly portable, with long-lasting battery life that can keep you going for up to 20 hours before needing to plug it back in.</p>
<p data-start="3266" data-end="3608" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/">Whether you need a reliable laptop for work, school, or personal use, the 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is an excellent choice.</a> Get it now for as low as $750 ahead of Black Friday.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has come up with an entirely new way to promote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">Chapter 6 finale event</a> and launch of Chapter 7 this weekend: by briefly turning the storm circle into a "storm seven" for an hour on Tuesday morning. Look at this:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047" data-ratio="0.562423500612" data-width="1634" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047"></a><figcaption>Fortnite Battle Royale's storm circle took on a new shape for a bit.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg"></figure><p>The change occurred at 6 AM PT and was reverted at 7 AM, with all games that started during that one-hour window having this odd new storm circle. The change was a promotional stunt to build hype for the Chapter 7 launch on Saturday, November 29--the chapter finale live event, which will only play one time ever, is Fortnite's biggest event every year, as it usually draws player counts in the tens of millions for whatever spectacle Epic has in store.</p><p>But the emphasis on the number 7 isn't just because we're about to start Chapter 7. During the finale live event we're also expecting the return of the Seven--Fortnite's Avengers-esque team of superheroes that had been led by Dwayne "The Foundation" Johnson until the end of Chapter 3, when they were eaten by evil liquid chrome. No members of the Seven have been seen since the start of Chapter 4, and the game pretty much stopped referencing them completely in Chapter 5, so their return would be a big deal.</p><p>The Chapter 6 finale is going down on November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, with virtual doors opening 40 minutes before. You can read more about what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">here</a>.</p>

<p>"I think partly," Houser said. "I think it's partly that, partly it put you in this exaggerated cinematic world, and mostly I would argue because it was this sense of freedom. Before that, games were either a shooting game or a driving game or a simulation game, and [GTA] was all three smashed together in a way that felt very free. And just, also, you know, when people talk about the metaverse or this digital world, those were the first games that showed you this idea of living in this fake place."</p><p>Houser went on to say that it was really GTA 3 that skyrocketed the franchise's popularity. Although the game came out two months after the devastating attack against the Twin Towers in New York, Houser noted that the team (formerly DMA Designs, now Rockstar North) was still excited about the project because there was something "magical" about what GTA 3 was doing.</p><p>"I think all of the team felt, with GTA 3, which was the kind of big breakthrough one in 2001 and we were very much running out of money at the time as a company--I think all of the team thought, 'This could be amazing. There's something really magical about this,'" Houser continued. "It was very raw and put together, but as it began to come together, it had these sort of moments of real innovation and real, kind of--it felt like the future in a way. But then, until it came out, no one outside of our company was very excited by it. That came out just after 9/11 in late 2001, and as it came out, people started to get more excited about it."</p><p>While Houser reminisced about the GTA series during the chat, he also talked about the controversial technology everyone loves to talk about: AI. He's currently "dabbling" with it but believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">it's overrated</a> and "not as useful" as some would have you believe.</p><p>In other Grand Theft Auto news, Rockstar Games announced earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">GTA VI has been delayed</a> to November 2026. The company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">a history of delaying its games</a>, which we broke down in detail.

It all paints a dour picture for GTA VI, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">analysts believe won't save the struggles the games industry has faced</a> lately, despite its almost-certain success.</p>

<p>New gameplay is more than Peppy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Chuhai Labs has shared the first gameplay trailer of its stunning-looking on-rails shooter, <strong>Wild Blue Skies</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Wild Blue</strong>), featuring some anthropomorphic animals piloting flying vehicles through the skies to fight evil. Sound a little familiar?</p>
<p>Okay, so the game still isn't confirmed for Switch (or Switch 2) yet — just PC and Xbox — but just watch the gameplay up top. Trust us. This is <em>basically</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a> with lovely cel-shaded-inspired visuals and all the barrel rolls, shooting and banter you'll ever need.</p>
<p>Here's a run-down if you need a <em>little</em> more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features Ready for Takeoff:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Modern Take on 90s On-Rails Shooters:</strong> Experience the thrill of classic aerial combat reimagined with modern design, smooth controls, and updated visuals.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>From an Aerial Legend:</strong> Developed by Chuhai Labs, the indie studio founded by Giles Goddard, the legendary programmer behind <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Stunt Race FX</em>, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and <em>1080° Snowboarding</em>.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>High-Flying Adventures:</strong> Take control of Bowie Stray and soar through vast environments from scorching deserts to frozen tundras and beyond.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Cinematic On-Rails Combat:</strong> Engage in thrilling dogfights and take down waves of enemies as you navigate intense, cinematic levels.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Environments:</strong> Each mission offers unique hazards and landscapes that challenge your reflexes and reward skillful flying.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Stylish Visuals &amp; Smooth Performance:</strong> A polished, modern aesthetic that channels the spirit of classic 3D shooters with crisp effects and fluid motion.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Streamlined Systems:</strong> Slick controls and intuitive gameplay make it easy to jump in while offering depth for veterans of the genre.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Rewarding Progression:</strong> Rack up high scores, complete optional tasks, and discover hidden collectibles as you battle against Grimclaw’s forces.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And look, if you need more convincing, one of the programmers of the original Star Fox — Giles Goddard — is working on this game' he's also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/stunt_race_fx">Stunt Race FX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080° Snowboarding</a>. of course, his most important work is in helping bring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> to GameCube.</p>
<p>Oh, and this is the same studio that worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cursed_to_golf">Cursed to Golf</a>. Basically, Wild Blue Skies looks absolutely lovely, and we would really like to see this on Switch.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get some news on other platforms soon!</p>

<p><em>Are you looking forward to Wild Blue Skies on Steam or Xbox? Do you hope it comes to Switch (2)? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

What was perhaps even more surprising was the reveal of Rosalina's Storybook, a hardback edition of the in-game page-turner that would be arriving in book stores a few months after the game.</p>
<p>Well, the day of release is finally upon us! Rosalina's Storybook is now available from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOorjBh-pADv0QYnniN05v02d6vsG-TfDFVi9uokLBXpP6ZTRWJ8e">My Nintendo Store</a> for $24.99 (or your regional equivalent), or from a bunch of other storefronts, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rosalinas-Storybook-Nintendo/dp/1506754902/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3GT8eJ_Pq9l9H4bUowCmpP16_qC-bT9pYu4wza_QqzoxwyQ0C7siKCKdrk2RyL2M409SBi0Ot_XpZuCfgtC3_7URhBjBtcV4rRQCXCh_olm8TVOfno18L3Azm_s0R0gStkNb6uXGdq2p0lHJPmQQWoO97Gu5wHwwKygEqna50Sw7xI9FHzMHEvyunDYHH0WGozV_8Xo9oCnmcfp7FwuR8ePcqnKcUVmLsB2B5bV503c.tfK6Je2N0XPqluVRHGK2bSnu9Y-TsyLjIQXo6eXZDgM&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;qid=1764086601&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANintendo&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3&amp;text=Nintendo" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/rosalinas-storybook/nintendo/9781506754901">Waterstones</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytws0BZJ-l_eg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890yojgiz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Much as you might expect, the book contains all the pages from the <em>original</em> game, retelling the story of a young girl and her relationship to the Lumas. Weirdly, it does not contain the new pages which were added for the Switch re-release, which feels like a bit of an oversight.</p>
<p>Either way, here's the book's official description from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.<br>
Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present <em>Rosalina’s Storybook</em> —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that the book, or some variation of it, will cameo in the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, with <strong>Captain Marvel</strong>'s Brie Larson taking on the all-important role of reading it as Rosalina. Larson joins <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> director Benny Safdie (Bowser Jr.) as the movie's new voice cast, whom we'll get to hear in full next April.</p>
<p>But the big question is, will you be picking up a copy of this galactic text for yourself? Sure, it might be a story we've all heard before, but it sure would look nice on a shelf. You can let us know if you've already nabbed yours in the following poll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Spellcasters Chronicles is the latest debut multiplayer game from a studio that is known for its single-player games, with Quantic Dream stepping up to try its hand in the genre. Ahead of the game's first closed beta, which will take place from December 4-7, I got the chance to play the game and ask game director Gregorie Diaconu a few questions about the coming title.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/spellcasters-chronicles-hands-on-preview-quantic-dream/">check out my hands-on preview with the game here</a> if you want to see how I got on with the time I had checking it out. In short, I'm not exactly convinced that Quantic Dream will be the first single-player-turned-multiplayer-studio that'll make both sides work. But there's still plenty of time for Quantic Dream to prove me wrong.</p>



<p>And, considering Diaconu's answers, the studio is ready to prove itself to me and to every other player currently looking at Spellcasters Chronicles with a doubtful eye.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Spellcasters Chronicles - Official Fire Elementalist Beta Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47UB8IVATOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>What was the driving force behind making a multiplayer game? What drew Quantic Dream towards this kind of project?</strong></p>



<p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles was born very organically inside the studio. Right after wrapping Detroit: Become Human, a small team started experimenting with a prototype that mixed action, strategy, and summoning, starting for the universal fantasy of being a powerful sorcerer who can summon armies of creatures of all shapes and sizes, and the simple joy of being able to fly without any limitation. It was fresh, energetic, and unlike anything we had done before, yet it still carried the things that define us: strong identity, systemic depth, and a desire to let players express themselves. </em></p>



<p><em>The prototype quickly caught everyone’s attention at the studio. What started as a side experiment became a fully-fledged production, and we built a dedicated team around it in 2020. In a way, Spellcasters Chronicles is a very natural extension of nearly three decades of Quantic Dream exploring new forms of interactivity. Since Omikron, we’ve constantly reinvented our grammar, whether through narrative branching, animation or technology through our custom engines and tools. We’ve never repeated ourselves, and we’ve always created original IPs. Adding multiplayer, competitive tension, and social interactions was simply the next step of that evolution.</em></p>



<p><em>And of course, as with all our projects, it’s an original IP conceived by David Cage, whose long-time desire to explore multiplayer gameplay and a high-fantasy universe naturally shaped the creative direction of the project. Spellcasters Chronicles allowed us to finally dive into those themes in a bold, stylized setting.</em></p>



<p><strong>Was it always going to be a free-to-play game? How did the studio fall on that choice, and is it a point of concern with how difficult it is for any game, F2P or not, to garner player attention?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes, from very early on, we felt that Spellcasters Chronicles needed to be free-to-play. The genre thrives on accessibility: we want players to be able to jump in without barriers, to try different Spellcasters, to experiment with strategies, and to enjoy the competitive ecosystem from day one. But being free-to-play doesn’t mean compromising our values. We’re dedicated to having fair monetization and, above all, to avoiding any pay-to-win elements.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re fully aware of how tough the multiplayer landscape is today, whether you’re free-to-play or premium. But we believe in this project because it comes from our studio’s own DNA. It’s bold, it’s different, and we think players will appreciate that. We also feel the market still rewards originality and sincerity, even in crowded genres. Our job now is to prove ourselves, one update at a time</em>.</p>



<p><strong>What will be the cadence of updates? Are new Spellcasters going to be added</strong> <strong>with each major update? How often will new maps be released?</strong></p>



<p><em>We’re not ready to share a full roadmap yet. But I can say that players can expect a very active update cycle. Major updates and seasonal drops will introduce new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, and even new Titans.</em></p>



<p><em>The goal is to keep the game feeling fresh and reactive to our community. We want players to always have something new to explore, master, and influence!</em></p>



<p><strong>What does it mean for Spellcasters Chronicles to have a "<em>community-driven narrative</em>"?</strong></p>



<p><em>This is one of the aspects we’re most excited about, and one we’ll reveal more about after the early beta phases. Right now, our priority is to let players focus on the core gameplay experience, because we’re not known for multiplayer games and we have a lot to prove. We want the gameplay foundations to speak for themselves first.</em></p>



<p><em>But at a high level: community-driven narrative is about giving players collective influence over the evolution of the universe. Each season, the community will face meaningful choices that can impact the lore, the world, and even gameplay elements. It’s a way of extending something that has always defined Quantic Dream: empowering players to shape stories. Except for this time, instead of individual branching paths, it becomes something shared, a story built by a community.</em></p>



<p><em>This closed beta is just the beginning. As we expand into the macro loop over the coming months, we’ll unveil how players can steer the fate of the world.</em></p>



<p><strong>How long does Quantic Dream expect to support Spellcasters Chronicles?</strong></p>



<p><em>Our intention is to support Spellcasters Chronicles for the long term. This isn’t a short experiment for us, it’s a major new IP and a project we’ve been building passionately for years. We’ve designed the systems, the narrative framework, and the seasonal structure with longevity in mind. Ultimately, the game’s lifespan will also be shaped by the community, and our commitment is simple: as long as players are there and engaged, we will continue to grow the world, expand the roster, and make the experience evolve.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will the game's first year look like?</strong></p>



<p><em>Again, the full roadmap will come later, but the first year is built around seasonal beats. Players can expect new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, Titans, seasonal events, and narrative updates tied to the community’s collective choices. The goal is to make Year One feel full of surprises, setting the tone for everything that will follow.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

              <p>Is Saudi Arabia’s takeover of EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">another big-brain play</a> or a sign of desperation? Can a more generous <em>Black Ops 7</em> battle pass convince players to keep playing? What does James Cameron&nbsp;<em>really</em> think about Netflix? It’s another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>As we skid into the long holiday weekend, I’m trying to decide exactly how many <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday</a> discounted game controllers I should buy to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. Or maybe I should just stop paying my electricity bill and force them all to take up knitting instead.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia is having an Embracer moment</h2> <p>The country’s Public Investment Fund has made a bunch of bad bets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). It reports that the sovereign wealth fund is running low on cash for new investments. You might remember one of them being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ig.ft.com/saudi-neom-line/">concept for a futuristic city</a> in the desert in the shape of one long line.</p>

 <p>This makes the fund’s massive bid to take EA private seem somewhat more desperate and precarious, given that much of it will be debt-financed at high interest rates. Embracer itself <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-saudi-arabia-dead-island-2-borderlands-deal-1850475619">once looked to the PIF to save it</a>, rapidly unraveling once a multi-billion dollar deal failed to materialize. It never recovered. We’ll see how long Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can continue flooding the zone with oil money to whitewash the country’s human rights record.</p>

 <p>Notably, the EA Saudi deal was reportedly facilitated by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. MBS recently visited the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl">in exchange for</a> fighter jets, advanced AI chips, and god knows what else. Trump brushed off MBS’s alleged role in having a Washington Post journalist murdered a few years back as “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-asked-about-khashoggi-murder-trump-says-things-happen-and-mbs-knew-nothing-about-it">things happen</a>” and claimed his family has done “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5613866/fact-checking-trumps-claim-his-family-has-done-little-business-with-saudi-arabia">little</a>” business with the Kingdom. I guess the largest leveraged buyout of an American firm by a foreign entity is just table stakes these days.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Black Ops 7</em> battle pass will be more generous than the <em>Black Ops 6</em> one</h2> <p>You’ll still have to battle FOMO, but unlocks will come more easily. “The team has taken learnings from <i>Black Ops 6</i>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey,” the devs <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Battle-Pass">wrote in a new blog post</a>. “The result: each season’s Battle Pass in <i>Black Ops 7</i> will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.”</p>

 <p>Initial pages will be shorter, and players can earn Battle Pass Tokens from Daily Challenges including in the co-op campaign, in case you’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">glutton for punishment</a>.</p> <h2>Palmer Luckey’s N64 clone is getting revealed soon</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ModRetro M64 hardware is getting a full reveal on Black Friday – features, colors, our incredible new controller, cutting-edge <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMD</a> hardware, etc.</p> <p>Much has changed since we launched early bird pricing at $199 earlier this year, things like inflation, component shortages,… <a href="https://t.co/T8MLilyweh">pic.twitter.com/T8MLilyweh</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ModRetro M64 is the arms dealer’s latest side project: an FPGA machine that plays old N64 cartridges on modern displays. Despite things like “inflation, component shortages, tariffs, and more,” the price will remain $200, which is 20 percent less than the recently launched Analogue 3D. The devil will be in the details, however. Luckey says all will be revealed on Black Friday, though a holiday 2025 release seems like a long-shot at this point.</p>

 <h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> gets a free update this week</h2> <p>The November 27 patch will <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">add more</a> weapons, enemies, and other small features, like some fresh team-up attacks for the musou fighter’s characters.</p> <h2>Helldivers 2 is getting jungle armor and giant chainsaws</h2> <p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos Warbond</a> will go live for players on December 2. In addition to the new Contra-style kits, players will get the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool which looks like a long buzz-saw that will slice through enemies and trees alike.</p> <h2>Big Jim hates Netflix</h2> <p>The <em>Avatar 3</em> director and box office giant James Cameron had some harsh words for the streamer’s Oscar strategy <a href="https://t.co/U5tk94vdNU">in a recent interview</a>. “We’ll put the movie out for a week, we’ll put it out for 10 days; we’ll qualify for Academy Awards consideration,” he said, critiquing the company’s free-loading strategy. “See, I think that’s fundamentally rotten at the core. The Academy Awards, to me, mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”</p> <p>Basically, he’s accusing Netflix of trying to draft off of the prestige of awards nominations without actually investing in theaters, all while its platform is directly undercutting the broader movie-going experience. Personally, I think Cameron could do a lot more to help theaters by releasing good movies instead of more <em>Avatar </em>sequels, but his underlying logic is unimpeachable.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967">People are training for ICE raids inside <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-multiplayer-metagross-xerneas-garchomp-2000646988"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> online battles are already super boring</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/dan-houser-ai-rockstar-gtav-rdr2-absurd-ventures-2000646935">Dan Houser is not buying all of the AI hype</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again. Early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are rolling in hot, which means you don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of top-rated items across all categories (TVs, laptops, smartphones, kitchen appliances, games) have already dropped to their lowest prices ever. Finding the right discounts that are worth your hard-earned money, however, can be a little overwhelming during such times, but that’s where we come in to help. Our shopping team is keeping an eye on the best deals around, so you don’t have to!</p>
<p>Those looking for a reliable storage solution — we have good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">Seagate just dropped its massive 4TB external hard drive by 20%, which means you can bring it home for just $100 today.</a> The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase, too. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. The deal, however, wraps up soon. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for it, but we’re not expecting it to last more than a couple of days. If you have been wanting to expand the storage of your computer or gaming console without spending a ton, now is the time to act. Grab it before the price shoots back up to $125.</p>

<h2>Stores All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>Running out of storage is never fun, and this drive is sure to take care of that issue for years to come. The storage capacity it offers is truly massive. 4TB storage means you will have space to house all your old and new data, which can include thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, years of backup, tons of research papers, an unusual number of work documents, plus all your favorite titles. And even after all of this, you will still have plenty of space left for future downloads. If you have ever been in a situation where you had to delete some of your old files to make room for new ones (like all of us), you’re going to greatly appreciate the peace of mind this brings.</p>
<p>It’s designed to work with Windows or Mac computers and select gaming consoles, with the setup being fairly straightforward. If you’re planning to use it with a Windows-based computer, you just need to plug in the power and then plug in the included USB cable. The drive should now appear in the (My) Computer/This PC and Windows Explorer/File Explorer. Using it with a Mac requires you to reformat the drive. Once that’s done, the system will detect the drive, and you can start using it.</p>



<p>This drive, despite the massive capacity it packs, is quite minimal and lightweight. It easily slides into a laptop bag without bulking things up, which makes it easier to take with you on the go when working remotely. You also don’t have to worry about losing your important data, as your purchase will include a year-long access to Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services. The service connects you to a team of world-class data recovery experts, offers one in-lab data recovery attempt, and gets you an encrypted storage device containing your recovered data if recovery is successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">In short, if you’ve been after a reliable storage solution for your important files, the Seagate 4TB external hard drive is a great option to consider, especially now that it’s available for just $100.</a> It not only offers a massive capacity, but is compatible with a range of devices and is easy to use, as well.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s next Premium Warbond, Python Commandos, drops on December 2, 2025; introducing a minigun, new weapons, stratagems, and more. </p>



<p>Premium Warbonds is the paid battle pass system in Helldivers 2, which provides players with exclusive content, including cosmetics, weapons, and more. A few months ago, we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST</a> Legendary Warbond, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils</a> followed it next. Now, the next Premium Warbond has been announced, adding a highly requested weapon to the game: a minigun. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond Weapons and Stratagems </h2>



<p>Revealed through the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Helldivers 2 is getting one new weapon and three new stratagems thanks to the Python Commandos Premium Warbond. First up is the M-1000 Maxigun, a new minigun that has an ultra-high ammo capacity. Next up is the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, which is a drone equipped with a flamethrower. It follows the player and coats their enemies with the fires of freedom. </p>



<p>Next up is another stratagem: the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, essentially a chainsaw that can cut through trees and enemies. Last, we have the AR/GL-21 One-Two, which is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher. It is a heavy weapon, but it deals heavy damage too, and basically puts two weapons in your primary slot. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-armors-and-capes">New Armors and Capes</h2>



<p>Let’s look at Helldivers 2: Python Commandos’ armors and capes; there are two new items in each category. The first armour is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set, “the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers.” Next is RS-40 Best of Prey: “a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.” Both armours come equipped with Rock Solid passive, which makes the player more resistant to staggering and ragdolling attacks. </p>



<p>There are two new capes and coordinating player cards: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.</p>



<h2 id="h-emotes-and-patterns">Emotes and Patterns</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond will add the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote, allowing players to “drop and give ‘em 20 anytime.” A new Chameleon Camo Pattern will also be included for FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-talk-about-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about their next game</a>.
