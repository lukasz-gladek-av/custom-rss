                <p>Sony has shared a new report with investors that touts PlayStation 5's marketplace gains and the continued expansion of PlayStation Plus' subscriber base. The latter has been so successful at adding users to the highest subscription tiers that Sony is already considering a price increase for PS Plus "to maximize profitability."</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2025/GNS_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report online</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishino appeared on a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fireside chat</a> and spelled out that the only direction for PlayStation Plus pricing is up.</p><p>"The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability," said Nishino.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus</a>'s Premium tier costs $160 per year in the US, while the Extra costs $135 and the Essential costs $80.</p><p>Nishino's statement came after Sony's presentation indicated that 38% of all PlayStation Plus subscribers opted for the top two tiers, Premium and Extra. Furthermore, the percentage of PS Plus subscribers on the Extra tier increased from 16% to 22% from Sony's 2022 fiscal year to its 2024 fiscal year. In that same period, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers rose from 13% to 17% of all PS Plus users.</p><p>Nishino noted that Sony would "add more value" to PS Plus subscriptions to justify increasing the price. It's unclear exactly what that might entail, especially since Sony has steered away from following Game Pass' path of dropping AAA games on the service on day one.</p><p>As recently as last April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-prices-have-increased-in-certain-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530919/" data-ref-id="1100-6530919">Sony raised PS Plus prices</a> in several countries, while sparing the US from any immediate increase. Players in North America may not be so lucky next time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686128/splatoon-3-switch-2-update-overview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075342/splatoon-3-family-bonding">Splatoon 3</a> </em>already looked phenomenal on the original Switch, in a way that seemed to defy the console’s hardware limitations. The game’s paint-slicked visuals were gorgeous, and its chaotic battles were a testament to how well the Switch could run software that was fine-tuned to make the best of its specs. What was most impressive, though, was the way <em>Splatoon 3 </em>kept refreshing itself for years after its initial 2022 release with a steady stream of new clothes, weapons, stages, and a nifty DLC expansion.</p><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>felt like it had reached its zenith on the original Switch — so much so that a full-on sequel seemed like the franchise’s logical next step as Nintendo prepared to release the Switch 2. But thanks to an unexpected update, <em>Splatoon 3 </em>plays like a slicker, sleeker, and more modern shooter on the new console. And while the improvements aren’t quite as dramatic as what we saw with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, they’re big enough to make <em>Splatoon 3 </em>feel like it’s more than capable of holding down the fort while Nintendo focuses on developing whatever’s next.</p><p>While battles within <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have always maxed out at 60fps, the first thing that jumps out about the game post-update is how that high framerate can now also be seen basically everywhere you guide your Inkling character. In the past, nonmatch locations like Splatsville, Inkopolis, and the Grand Festival Grounds never looked bad, per se. But there was a roughness to characters’ animations as they walked around and a stiffness to the way the environment moved that made those places feel like they were trying hard to not push the original Switch past its limits. </p><p>After the new Switch 2 update, which also bumps the game’s resolution up, everything in Inkopolis flows with a delightful slickness that makes the place feel alive. Inklings’ steps and idling poses are still measured and slow, but there is a gracefulness to them now that made me pay closer attention to people’s avatars. And while the update doesn’t bring any drastic changes to <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s character models, you can clearly see the fine details of their stylish hypebeast fits and the way light interacts with the glossy, reflective surfaces of their skin.</p><p>Better-looking NPCs hanging out in lobbies might not seem like a big deal, but it’s an important part of the <em>Splatoon </em>experience because of the way most of the characters you see in places like Inkopolis are actually other players’ avatars. The added visual polish works to remind you that <em>Splatoon</em> <em>3</em> is very much a community-focused game that still has a dedicated playerbase, and as I walked around, it was great seeing so many higher-resolution characters sharing messages about how they were enjoying the update.</p><p>You can also feel how much more horsepower the Switch 2 is working with in how quickly <em>Splatoon 3 </em>now breezes through its loading screens as you’re getting ready to dive into a match. Once you’re actually in a battle, you can really start to get a sense of how the update impacts <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s core gameplay on the Switch 2 and why, for people still playing on the original Switch, Nintendo decided to strip out some of the background visual elements in certain competitive modes.</p><p>On the whole, regular PvP matches ran every bit as well at 60fps as they did on the first Switch, but you can see that background elements in the far off distance, like the jellyfish spectators, now move much more smoothly. It stands to reason that Nintendo chose not to drastically change how <em>Splatoon 3 </em>battles run on the Switch 2 so as not to put players on the original Switch at an unfair disadvantage. That’s also probably why, after the update, some of the background elements in the Splat Zones / Tower Control /Rainmaker / Clam Blitz modes have been removed on the first Switch. In my experience, this didn’t really change all that much because you’re meant to be focused on painting the ground and splatting your enemies. But those changes likely help the Switch dedicate more of its energy to displaying the important things well.</p><p>Even when there’s a horde of enemies swarming in Salmon Run mode, their animations are much, much smoother, which actually makes it easier to keep track of what’s going on as matches become more hectic. It was still almost impossible to get my teammates to pull it together when a Horrorboros showed up and started hurling paint bombs at us, but that felt like the sort of issue that might be more easily addressed in a follow-up game that makes use of the <em>Switch 2</em>’s voice chat feature.</p><p>For both consoles, the update also introduces a slew of remixed weapons. Giving standard weapons, like the Aerospray, different sub-weapons has always been a core part of <em>Splatoon</em>, and the new kits are essentially an invitation to try out your old favorites with a couple of new tricks attached that encourage unique play styles.For longtime <em>Splatoon 3 </em>players, everything about the update really serves as a reminder of how much fun the game has always been. But it also feels like Nintendo is making an effort to bring more players into the fold ahead of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684199/splatoon-raiders-switch-2-spinoff"><em>Splatoon Raiders</em>’ launch</a>. And, as nice as it would have been to have a new <em>Splatoon </em>title for the Switch 2’s launch, it’s fantastic to see Nintendo making moves that benefit the entire Switch family as a whole.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The summer sun beams as a crowd, walking in something that would resemble a line if observed from outer space, snakes down a Los Angeles street. It’s so long that I can’t see its beginning or end. As far as my tired eyes can tell, it just goes and goes until, off in the distance, it meets the horizon. Some people carry signs lambasting ICE and Nazis; one has Hello Kitty waving a Palestinian flag on it. Other protesters run the gamut from looking like they stopped here on their way to brunch to wearing full costumes. There is a Labubu cosplayer holding an anti-ICE sign atop a bridge. Social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ruemcclammyhand.bsky.social/post/3lr4zldank22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly declares them a hero</a>.</p><p>The scene is one of tense revelry. Resistance moms, 2020-hardened black bloc types, and everyone in between share space, sometimes chanting, sometimes singing, sometimes marching in silence – all aware that cops lurk on the periphery, and that with cops comes violence. Suddenly, we all hear a loud popping sound far away enough that we can’t quite pinpoint it. An acquaintance checks their phone; apparently the police just deployed tear gas.&nbsp;</p><p>I check my phone, too. Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p><p>I turn to tell the friend I accompanied to this immense Sunday, June 8 protest, a games journalist I will not name because they were out marching during work hours. “Me too,” they reply. “I’ve got one in, like, 40 minutes.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Oh no, I realize, I have to leave. For my video game appointment.</p></blockquote></figure><p>There’s no calling a car in the kind of traffic these teeming streets have produced, so I resolve to run back to the site of Summer Game Fest’s Play Days event, a bonanza of demos and meeting opportunities meant to be a smaller stand-in for what E3 once was. Fortunately, the venue is only a little over a mile away from the still-swelling crowd, so I narrowly make it in time for my scheduled presentation of Capcom’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-impressions-preview-souls-orbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Onimusha: Way Of The Sword</em></a> and <em>Resident Evil 9</em>. I am drenched in sweat, clothes clinging to me like I just emerged from a swimming pool. This attracts a few stares, but the problem solves itself when I’m escorted into a cool, dark theater occupied by around 30 other games journalists and content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>But the whiplash is impossible to ignore. Where the last crowd I was part of whooped and hollered in defense of their rights and the rights of others, this one goes positively apeshit for a menu option. The <em>Resident Evil 9</em> demo, an understated affair that centers around a tall monster woman <a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-simulation-stepped-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perhaps pointedly</a> engineered to look <em>un</em>-hot, ends with the player pausing the game and switching from first-person – the viewpoint of the last couple mainline series entries – to third-person. The crowd goes wild. I feel like I’m on a different planet than I was less than an hour ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome to Summer Game Fest. Also, American society is collapsing, so welcome to that, too.</p><hr><p>Sunday afternoon develops a predictable rhythm: I play a game. I check my phone. I play another game. I check my phone. I play a third game. I check my phone. Police, I learn from local reporters on Bluesky and Hasan Piker’s stream, have turned the chill, at times downright joyful march I was part of into a battleground. Using flashbangs, tear gas, and vehicles, they kettle protesters onto a highway. Reporters and protesters <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/melbuer.bsky.social/post/3lr2in7bowc2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustain grievous injuries</a> from “less lethal” weapons, which crucially – even according to their own designation – remain at least situationally lethal. Protesters call automated Waymo cars <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-weaponization-of-waymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to light on fire</a>, which is incredibly funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Summer Game Fest is just far away enough from the action that those desperate sounds don’t reach our ears, but the helicopters buzzing overhead certainly do. After a certain point, they become a background noise it would be easy to tune out if not for what they represent: a government, derelict of duty, surveilling and attacking its own people.</p><p>As afternoon fades to early evening, I sit down to try out a <em>John Wick</em>/kung-fu movie-inspired action game called <em>Spine</em>. The game is rough around the edges, but its action is stylish and propulsive, while everything else about it harks back to 2009 in a way that makes me question how it’s getting made today (complimentary). Moreover, the enthusiasm of its Cyprus-based dev team is infectious. Midway through the demo, they tell me about the game’s world and story.</p><p>"It's kind of dystopian, and this city [where the game takes place] is completely messed up,” says community lead Artur Ovchinnikov. “It's controlled by a big corporation called Tenzer Corp, and the head of the corporation is some kind of... artificial intelligence, but government system. There is a social rating system. [The government] is controlling every [person], every movement. There is a gap between rich people and poor people. But in the beginning of the game [main character] Redline doesn't care about this thing. She's trying to rescue her brother. She doesn't care about all these social problems in this city, but the deeper she gets into the mission of rescuing her brother, the deeper she gets into this rebellious stuff."</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from the only time that I’ve heard about games exploring eerily relevant themes; not just recently, but today. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPa7KaQXp8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s SGF-adjacent showcase</a>, a trailer for sci-fi puzzle adventure <em>Planet Of Lana II</em> began with its young protagonist explaining how “they came to our home” and “took everyone” as ships that resembled bombs rain from the sky. On Bluesky, musician and video game critic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ellaguro.bsky.social/post/3lr4hftacys2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liz Ryerson</a> acknowledged the elephant in the room: “I hope we are all not so desensitized that we can all appreciate the irony of Xbox showing off games that look like this in their showcase given why a lot of people are not watching this stream,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement’s ongoing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycott of Xbox products</a> – which has resulted in one studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulling its game from the Xbox store</a> entirely – millions still watched Microsoft’s film-length video game commercial. But <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as with previous Keighley carnivals</a>, each time games’ themes hit a little too close to home without acknowledging the broader context in which they exist, the disconnect becomes harder and harder to ignore. (I would’ve liked to ask Microsoft developers for their thoughts on this uncomfortable tension, but even after repeated requests, Microsoft did not allow me to attend its event.)</p><p>All this in mind, I decide to ask <em>Spine</em>’s developers what they think of the situation unfolding around them in LA, a clear instance of the exact sort of government overreach and class division they pride themselves on exploring in their game. This question is not met with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's a tough question," art director Alexander Nemov replies awkwardly, adding that he hasn't spent much time in America. "Probably I don't have anything in the moment."</p><hr><p>After SGF winds down for the day, I attempt to rejoin the protest. This proves impossible; night has fallen, and cops have blocked the streets leading to the bulk of the crowd. Displaced protesters find themselves in uneasy across-the-way staring contests with armed and armored officers. Meanwhile, lines of police cars blare their sirens while blasting to some unknown destination, their irritating mechanical shrieks only drowned out by protest supporters sporadically driving by in their own vehicles, honking horns and hoisting flags. Eventually, I elect to call it a night.</p><p>Just a few streets over, I once again feel like I’m inhabiting a different planet. Despite what right-wing and even centrist media might tell you, Los Angeles has not descended into chaos. To take it a step further, neither has <em>downtown </em>Los Angeles, the mere slice of the gargantuan pie that is southern California’s best-known region where protests are taking place. “Fuck ICE” graffiti and the odd person carrying a sign advocating a similar message aside, you would not know that this place was the site of what Trump and his cronies are trying to deem an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-accuses-some-los-angeles-protesters-of-being-paid-insurrectionists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insurrection</a>. People meander between bars, restaurants, and other destinations. Cars drive by at normal speeds and refrain from honking their horns. A dude on a bike asks some alt kids who are walking behind me if they’re in a band. They laugh.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley’s show must go on, for he is the oddly wooden impresario fate has chosen to give us a WORLD EXCLUSIVE preview of the sinking of the Titanic, but it never feels like SGF is in real danger of grinding to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, while wandering the Summer Game Fest show floor, which is really more of a big room in a small village of kiosks, cafes, and food trucks, I overhear a telling conversation between PR people.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The protests] are just far enough that it doesn’t really affect anything,” says one.</p><p>“Affect <em>anything</em>?” replies another.</p><p>“Affect… the show,” the first clarifies.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>That’s not to say it’s easy to just ignore the protests amassing nearby each day, nor does it seem like many developers attending Summer Game Fest want to. While I ask a fair number how they’re feeling about the situation, the topic comes up organically more often than not. Some want to know what being in the thick of a protest was like. Others volunteer information about the small ways daily demonstrations escalated by police into violent confrontations have impacted them. For example, one journalist shows me how both the Lime and Bird scooter apps have placed heavy restrictions on an area that includes SGF due to protesters’ proclivity for throwing scooters at cop cars, which – as with the Waymo situation – I must point out is incredibly funny.</p><p>But the overriding sentiment SGF attendees feel the need to convey, as though it’s a weight threatening to cave in their chests, is guilt. Multiple PR people repeatedly lament that they can’t make it out into the streets because of job obligations. The aforementioned journalist tells me that they at least donate money to relevant causes. Another journalist concurs with a statement they heard while drinking and networking in the nearby JW Marriott hotel lobby the night before: “We’re the bad guys in <em>The Hunger Games</em>.” They go on to add that they believe SGF attendees are doing “a lot of fiddling while Rome burns.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Asked directly about the awkward middle ground they’ve unwittingly wandered into, a few developers eschew guilt in favor of pragmatism.</p><p>"Whatever gets you going and pushes you into action, if guilt is what does it, sure. Feel what you're gonna feel,” says Alx Preston, founder of <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, and <em>Possessors </em>studio Heart Machine. “I think for me, though, guilt's maybe not quite the right word. Maybe something more like confusion, frustration. What do I do? What can I do? What should I be doing because I have a responsibility to the team, the company, the things we've been working on for a long time, everyone else that works at Heart Machine.”</p><p>Preston contends with health issues that limit his physical capabilities. Still, he can’t help but feel a responsibility to the city that molded him.</p><p>"I think there's some idea there, especially as someone who's lived in Los Angeles for 20 years, that I should be there for those protests,” Preston says. “I should be doing something to contribute to that in some way or another. But what's my platform? What's my capacity? What am I able to do? ... It's in moments like these where you're weighing your personal responsibilities versus societal and community priorities versus work and capitalism to support yourself in a system that you don't control. That's the math that everyone's doing more or less every time these [major historical] events start to come together."&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>This feeds into a larger question many find themselves asking in these increasingly tumultuous times: What is the point of making, playing, critiquing, or reporting on video games when it feels like the world is ablaze? And in the case of an in-person event hosted in the United States like Summer Game Fest (or others of potentially greater consequence <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like PAX and GDC</a>), is it worth potentially putting yourself in harm’s way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a weird time right now being here in LA and inside this air-conditioned warehouse while people are getting arrested for no reason,” says Chandana Ekanayake, co-founder and creative director of <em>Dosa Divas</em> and <em>Thirsty Suitors</em> studio Outerloop. “It's been surreal as a naturalized citizen in the US where I could probably get deported for no fucking reason. And it's like, oh, we're here talking about video games. But a lot of the themes, as a creator, and thinking about this stuff, it does go into the game itself. … For me, I want to put a little hopefulness into the world. I have two teenage sons, and I want to leave something for them. I want the world to accept them for who they are."</p><p>Some are forced to keep their guards up more than others. Veerender Jubbal, a Sikh games writer and reporter who lives in Canada, entered the United States for SGF on the back of mounting tensions between the two countries, as well as horror stories like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that of Jasmine Mooney</a>, a Canadian who got detained by ICE for two weeks despite being white and therefore (you would think) an unappealing target to the racist motherfuckers in charge.&nbsp;</p><p>"If a Canadian white woman can get detained for two weeks, then someone like myself, with a turban and a beard – and [who is] a Sikh journalist advocating on representation and those sorts of things – [is in significantly greater danger]," says Jubbal.&nbsp;</p><p>But Jubbal still sees games – and the opportunities that arise from a trip to the US – as worth the risk. He cautions people against viewing games, even in a purely entertainment-based capacity, as frivolous.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've said this to white games journalists who feel like this is all superfluous and stuff, but I've done so much map and guide work,” says Jubbal. “That aids in helping people distract themselves from what's going on, especially… people of color."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Another games journalist whose parents are currently in the process of immigrating, which limits their ability to speak publicly on these matters, concurs.</p><p>"I was thankful for SGF taking so much of my time and attention away from the very real rise of fascism and noxious xenophobia, which could impact my life in a way that makes me truly sick to think about," they say. "I feel completely powerless in my life right now, and I'm somewhat soothed by games that embolden me to become the opposite."</p><p>They regret not being able to join the protests – or even post about what they believe in online, despite pressure from peers – out of concern for their parents, but they nonetheless hope others can learn from this moment.&nbsp;</p><p>"SGF also made me realize that I want people to know that an 'illegal immigrant' does not fit any one box or set of adjectives," they say. "If you stand next to me, you're standing next to someone directly impacted by a domestic human rights crisis. I, and many others, don't want to tell you that, because we're afraid."</p><hr><p>Despite E3’s demise, one of its grand traditions persists during Summer Game Fest: the advertizing real estate on the Hotel Figueroa mural, reserved exclusively for those with pockets so deep that when they reach for their wallet, a mole person hands it to them. This year, the honor goes to <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s collaboration with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, resulting in a multi-story ode to Cloud, Sephiroth, and, implicitly, brand synergy as a concept.&nbsp;</p><p>A photo of the mural <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lrbtfdlpqc2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makes its way onto the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> subreddit</a>, albeit with a twist: It was clearly taken during a protest, with signs and flags framing it, which leads a moderator to step in and request that users avoid discussing politics. “Let’s just appreciate the picture,” they say.</p><p>“Considering the picture, this is a crazy ask,” one user replies.</p><p>Even with fascism almost literally knocking at the front door, some will prioritize the longstanding gaming culture tradition of sticking their fingers in their ears and ignoring inconvenient politics. It is a tendency born first and foremost of propaganda and privilege, but Ben Myres – the creative director of <em>Relooted</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game about reclaiming African artifacts from Western museums</a> that got announced during SGF and that’s getting lambasted online by all the usual suspects – has an additional explanation for the social consciousness divide between some game developers and some of the people who play games.&nbsp;</p><p>“To make a game… you have to be deeply empathetic, almost by default, because you're making something for someone else to experience,” he says. “But on the player side, you're used to being centered in the game. You become the center of that experience. So I think it changes something in your head: The entitlement manifests to such an extent because that's your default. The developers are used to creating something for someone else, while some people who play games are used to everything being about them."</p><p>Perhaps it’s an oversimplification, or just one beam that splits into a prism of problems, but a worthwhile question emerges: What will happen to the people raised in these pockets of gaming culture as political situations like those that occurred during Summer Game Fest become more common? As Aftermath contributor Autumn Wright <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lr4hza3a7k2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a>, “imperialism and the consumerism are always happening all the time,” and with America turning its imperial tactics toward its own core, it is extremely likely that we’ll see more and more strange bedfellows of this sort, until they’re no longer strange at all. Protests, skirmishes, and riots outside of conventions, conferences, and concerts – maybe inside them too. People moving between one and the other, trying for as long as possible to maintain a sense of normalcy, <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to cosplay it even as industries enter freefall</a> and infrastructure collapses. We’ve hit a tipping point, and unless the powers that be decide to suddenly stop agitating, we can’t turn back.</p><p>In that sense, perhaps this year’s Summer Game Fest gave us the ultimate preview: one of the world to come. If that ends up being the case, great job, Geoff. You've really outdone yourself.</p><hr><p>Despite this year’s Summer Game Fest being characterized by a pervasive disconnect, the events of the past week eliminated another, less obvious disconnect from previous years. As Minn/Max’s Janet Garcia writes in what was originally going to be a response to my questions about her time at Summer Game Fest, but which blossomed into <a href="https://pentopixels.com/article/summer-game-fest-2025-ice-protests-la" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a truly excellent standalone piece</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This is my third year at Summer Game Fest and with every year come disparaging comments about Los Angeles. It builds up quickly: “I hate downtown LA. I hate LAX. I hate how dirty it is here. I hate the sirens outside my hotel window. I hate the traffic. I hate how expensive the uber is tonight.” The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>LA’s biggest haters from the games industry would be quick to say they’re only here because they have to be for work. For some of them, that’s probably true. But for many I know that it is not. The reality is they wanted to attend SGF: for their own coverage, for the opportunities, to network, for the experience, that list goes on too.&nbsp;</p><p>People are quick to reap LA’s benefits while dismissing the entire culture. People will exclusively take from LA then claim the city is fake. As if there was anything genuine about coming to a city to get what you need while complaining the whole time that you needed it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure they’d be ready to clarify that it’s not the people, it’s the city itself, and that’s frankly even more frustrating: the fact that they think the two can be divorced. That the place can be separated from the people.&nbsp;</p><p>It can’t.</p><p>But behind fencing, blocked roads, security-guarded metal detectors, and the tall hedges of SGF's campus, it’s easy to pretend. They can imagine they’re not in the city they love to hate. This year, they couldn’t.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Willingly or not, SGF attendees were gifted a front-row seat to authentic community action, to people united by a common cause putting their bodies on the line for others, whether those were their neighbors or people they’d never met. There’s been endless discourse about optics and protesting The Right Way, whatever that means, but when the dust settles – whether in a few days, a few months, or a few years – that’s the only part any serious person will remember. The rest, including and perhaps especially SGF 2025, will be little more than a footnote.</p><hr><p>The final evening before my flight back to NYC from LA, I attend one more protest. By this point the mayor has implemented a curfew – the exact thing that led to me getting arrested when I lived in Virginia back in 2020 – causing me to immediately question the wisdom of my decision. But curiosity and the sense of duty that comes with any form of journalism, even that which centers mostly around video games, get the better of me.</p><p>When I arrive at downtown LA’s federal building, the location where crowds have been convening for the past couple days, I’m stunned at how few people are present. A small handful of protesters and reporters mill about while a tiny woman, voice bolstered by the great equalizer that is a megaphone, shouts at 15 or so National Guard troops guarding the building’s entrance. I feel secondhand embarrassment even though I know I shouldn’t, if only because I can’t stop imagining how awkward that same scenario would be if I was in her shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I find more protesters gathered outside the nearby US Justice Department building, but again, the scene is more ghost town than showdown. “It’s gonna be 4,000 National Guard and 700 marines versus 50 unarmed bystanders,” one protester jokes to their friends.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>I consider packing it in, but little by little, the crowd grows, bolstered by people of all stripes wrapping up work and – instead of resting, scrolling on their phones, playing video games, or some combination of the three – taking to the streets. Around 30 minutes before curfew, we make our way back over to the federal building, where an actual crowd has formed. We combine our forces and begin chanting, which causes the federal building to fart out more cops and National Guard soldiers. It’s still not the most impressive display on our part, but it’s something.</p><p>Then, with 20 minutes left before curfew, a colossal horde of protesters – I’m talking hundreds – rounds a corner, and suddenly we’re cooking with the kind of propane that would bring Hank Hill to his knees. It’s like some shit out of a movie: people whooping and cheering, beside themselves with glee now that the cavalry has arrived. The two crowds move to meet each other. “The people united will never be divided,” they repeatedly chant, a protest classic that’s become a favorite of mine because nobody can agree on whether it’s supposed to end with “divided” or “defeated.”</p><p>The crowd is ultimately divided that night, but not defeated. Protesters return the next day, and the day after. Across the country, others do the same. Now they’re <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joining rapid response networks</a> run by immigrant rights groups and learning about mutual aid. They’re realizing just how deep their roots run.</p><p>“You go to a protest, and you’re talking to everyone all of sudden,” a community organizer named Mar told <a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2025/06/ice-raids-separate-families-bring-los-angeles-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Public Press</a>. “When is the best place to meet, if not when fighting back?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There will always be more of us than there are of them; connection will always come more naturally than fear. We will win. It’s just a matter of time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> is back, and that means thousands of demos are available on Steam for players to download and potentially find their next favorite game before it's officially out.</p>
<p>I love Steam Next Fest, if for nothing else than the fact that I get to try a bunch of new games for free, and in quick succession, because plenty of these demos don't take any longer than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I played several demos over the course of this week, and these are the ones that I absolutely loved, that you should spend your weekend diving into.</p>
<h3>Mina the Hollower - Developed by Yacht Club Games - Release Date: October 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mina-the-Hollower.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This one is an easy recommendation for me, because I knew I would like it going in. I love platformers, and ever since I played through Shovel Knight, I've paid attention to everything Yacht Club Games has done. When I first heard about Mina the Hollower, I'll admit I was a tad disappointed to not see Yacht Club going back to the drawing board for a new 2D platformer, but my belief in the studio and the first clips of gameplay I saw from Mina convinced me I had nothing to be sad about. This would be a great game that I'd love.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/">Playing this demo</a> is the first chance I've had to try Mina the Hollower, and now that we have a definitive <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">release date for it</a>, I can easily say this is my most anticipated game of the year. The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</p>
<h3>Baby Steps - Developed By Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy - Release Date: September 8, 2025 - PC, PS5</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Baby-Steps-Steam-Next-Fest-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>What do you get when you pair the developers behind QWOP, Getting Over It, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ape-out-rampaging-gorilla/">Ape Out</a> together? A game about a 35-year old man living in his parents' basement who learned to walk by playing QWOP, pretty much.</p>
<p>But what really intrigues me about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2460140/Baby_Steps_Demo/">Baby Steps</a> more than just its wonky and purposely-frustrating walking mechanics is that there's much more to it than just the challenge of taking the next step. It's incredibly funny from the jump, and while the demo doesn't last long enough to necessarily confirm this, it's clear to me that there's a deeper layer of storytelling waiting in the full game. Or, at the very least, there's more humor to come from our protagonist really needing to use the bathroom but being unable to find one. Either way, I'm in.</p>
<h3>Bloodthief - Developed by Blargis - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bloodthief-Steam-Next-Fest.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> game when it came out, but since then, I've yet to find a game that scratched the same itch the first one did. Even the sequel, I thought, didn't do the trick. Which is why I'm thankful for having played Bloodthief, if for no other reason than the game achieving that blend of fast-paced, 3D-platforming and parkouring action and scratching that itch once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/">Bloodthief</a> is a classic, simple-looking, 2-feet-wide, 10-feet-deep kind of game. If you want to dig into the parkour mechanics and push them to their limits, what I've played of its levels so far shows that there's plenty for you to dig into. Even in the opening levels, I was finding alternate paths through the parkouring by simply thinking 'I can make that jump,' and figuring out that I could, if I was nimble enough. It's not the same one-hit-kill style combat as Ghostrunner, but it still plays within the same realm of you can only take so many hits before you have to go back to the checkpoint. I also appreciate the shift from a high-gloss, neon-light-filled cyberpunk world to a muted, medieval setting. It makes the dark red blood really stand out, and it's just more fun to watch armored knights flailing their swords and running at you at full sprint.</p>
<h3>Henry Halfhead - Developed by Lululu Entertainment - Release Date: TBA - PC and Consoles</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Henry-Halfhead-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I love a good, odd, puzzle game that encourages you to find your own solution to a problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058140/Henry_Halfhead/">Henry Halfhead</a> is exactly that, and it has a fun and intriguing core mechanic to boot. Being able to jump into pretty much any object is a fun loop, and I'm hopeful that the full game will feature deeper layers of puzzles.</p>
<p>The ones in the demo aren't bad, they're just introductory, so they're not going to be the most complicated. Still, I left the demo feeling like this could be one of the better puzzle games of the year, depending on how it evolves. As a Steam Next Fest demo though, playing Henry Halfhead is a great way to spend some time, even if you just sit around and listen to a song that starts playing part of the way through, as I did.</p>
<h3>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound - Developed by The Game Kitchen - Release Date: July 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ninja-Gaiden-Ragebound.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Announced at last year's Game Awards, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2542120/NINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound,</a> to me, is similar to IO Interactive developing a James Bond game. What else could you expect from the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a>, besides something amazing, when you ask them to make a 2D action-platforming Ninja Gaiden game?</p>
<p>Spending some time with this demo pretty much just confirmed for me what I was already expecting, that The Game Kitchen was the perfect choice to bring the series that began in 2D back to its original format, while kicking it up to the levels that developers today have been achieving with 2D action games. I can't wait for the full release, which is coming in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>
<h3>Yasuke: A Lost Descendant - Developed by Dallience Studios - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Yasuke-A-Lost-Descendent-Steam-Next-Fest-June-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This recommendation is the only one that comes with a major technical caveat, which is the fact that it didn't exactly run as smooth as I would have hoped. That said, the high-octane action and extremely flashy combat and parkour on display in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446760/YASUKE_A_Lost_Descendant/">Yasuke: A Lost Descendant</a> shined through its performance issues.</p>
<p>If you're one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-10-million-units-almost-one-million-of-which-in-the-last-few-months/">10 million who bought Devil May Cry 5</a> and are looking for something new to fill that stylish action-sized hole, and don't mind adding a touch of 3D platforming into the mix, then Yasuke: A Lost Descendant should definitely be on your radar. Sure, the performance issues might get in the way of your enjoyment, but it's the game's alpha build, and this is Steam Next Fest. The understanding is the games we're playing are not the final, full-polished version. The gameplay and combat mechanics that are at the heart of Yasuke: A Lost Descendant are clearly very solid, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the full release can offer when it eventually does release.</p>
<h3>Metal Eden - Developed by Reikon Games - Release Date: Q3 2025 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Metal-Eden-Demo-Released.png"></a></figure>

<p>We've been following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/">Metal Eden</a> here at Wccftech since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">first revealed earlier this year</a>, and at the time, we thought it would already be out by now, with a May 6, 2025 release date set. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">since been delayed</a>, with no new release date to look forward to, but after playing the demo I'm happy to let developer Reikon Games take as long as they need. Whenever it's ready, I'll be there.</p>
<p>Metal Eden's fast-paced, stylish shooting and fluid movements all feel amazing, and while the game's story could turn out to be a dud in the full release, at least with what I've seen so far in the demo, I'm very intrigued to find out more. It scratches a similar itch to the one Bloodthief and Ghostrunner scratched. I'm clearly a mark for a first-person action game that lets you wall run like its nobody's business.</p>
<h3>Morsels - Developed by Furcula - Release Date: 2025 - PC, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Morsels-Steam-Next-Fest-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I truly did love all the demos listed here in this latest edition of Steam Next Fest, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't have a favorite among the new games I played. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Morsels</a> is that favorite, as it immediately hit me with a 1-2 punch of an art style that looked like it was out of a fever dream, and a soundtrack that I want to have in my music library yesterday.</p>
<p>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</p>
<hr>
<p>Those are my Steam Next Fest recommendations for June 2025. What have you been playing this Next Fest? Let us know in the comments which upcoming games you have your eyes on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>At the Mix, I got to check out the following games. I've listed them not only with their name, but also their genre in case you're wanting to look through to find something you're specifically interested in.</p>

<h2><em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed by Ciaran Games LLC and published by Silver Lining Interactive</p>

<p>The first game I got buried into was <em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em>. Picking up the controls, I was off with a sprint, making my way through a building and out to a dock, dodging the oncoming attacks of strange boxing cat-like creatures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=ESkC1cVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=TsD4u10m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could attack physically, use the shotgun built into the main character's arm (if you hadn't already used up all of the ammo), and perform flying kicks that would ramp up your character's momentum.</p>

<p>After a brief linear section, I'd reach an arena only to be absolutely swarmed by enemies, but coming close time and time again, I was always ready to hop right back into action. Each death I'd learn a bit more, become a bit faster, and more accurate as I took out waves of enemies.</p>

<p>While not traditionally my cup of tea, I can imagine that those who are fans of the genre would get a kick out of the action and comedy behind <em>Captain Wayne</em>. You can also play the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319790/Captain_Wayne__Vacation_Desperation/" rel="nofollow"> demo right now on Steam</a> if you're interested to learn more.</p>

<h2><em>Death Howl</em></h2>

<p>Soulslike Deck Builder<br>
Developed by The Outer Zone and published by 11 bit studios</p>

<p>In <em>Death Howl</em>, you are a grieving woman trying try chase after her child, who she believes was turned into a deer and escaped. To do so, you'll need to make it through a dangerous forest, defeating enemies, collecting resources, and powering yourself up to take on ever-growing challenges.</p>

<p>When I first read the genre match up I wasn't quite sure about it, but I immediately saw the potential after reaching my first battle.</p>

<p>Stepping towards an enemy a grid will slowly appear, stepping into it combat will initiate. Each site takes turns moving a performing actions. For the player there is a set limit of actions you can take, playing cards from your hand has a certain cost, as does moving. Once you pass the turn the relatively simple AI of the monsters will then take theirs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=EcpezF7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=IDZXiRvZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This game isn't just about the tactical knowledge of your own cards, but also understanding the way that the AI will work. In my second battle, an enemy bird that I learned can only attack at a distance was positioned near a wall. I was able to use my movement to trap it in a corner, meaning it couldn't attack.</p>

<p>Between battles, there's an overworld to explore and larger enemies to encounter, but returning to the <em>Death Howl</em> equivalent of a Bonfire will let you spend souls for upgrades, craft new cards, but also cause all enemies to respawn.</p>

<p>If you're after a tough tactical combat game with deckbuilding mechanics that might scratch the Soulslike itch, then I couldn't recommend Death Howl more. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" rel="nofollow">Check out the Demo now on Steam</a>, I know <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40310ab5-423c-4eee-903b-b3e8faa3c6bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025" rel="nofollow">our very own Don Parsons enjoyed it too</a></p>

<h2><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em></h2>

<p>Arena Mech Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by ANIMO Industries, Inc</p>

<p><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em> is an arena shooter that borrows the ideas of cute animals as well as mecha inspired combat games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b376023c-fb2d-49ea-b4df-5f3a8a5044c4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters" rel="nofollow"><em>Gundam </em></a>or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="03244906-2902-4e23-85ef-5130a9a95ce8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-claw-grip-forever" rel="nofollow"><em>Armored Core</em></a>. Sure you're going into a competitive battle as a chicken in a tank, but each part of that tank can be customized.</p>

<p>Adjust the way you move, the defenses you have, and what types of weapons you're armed with to create a build that best fits your playstyle, or have a few prepared to swap between during battle.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2323240/ANIMO_Stars_Arena/" rel="nofollow">demo is also available on Steam.</a></p>

<h2><em>Prison of Husks</em></h2>

<p>PS2-Inspired Soulslike<br>
Developed and Published by Glass Head Dolls</p>

<p>I'm really not much of a Soulslike person, but I couldn't help but stop in front of <em>Prison of Husks</em>, a game where everything about the gothic castle setting, to blocky PS2 models just screamed at me to play it. We're not talking late PS2 either, this is like launch-title PS2 blockyness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=dVDZBRmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=d3ebZPWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You play as a pale doll that has come to life to try to explore or escape the castle.</p>

<p>The gameplay was quick fast paced and filled with all of the standard soulslike faire. Recharging stamina that you'll need to keep an eye on, a parry mechanic, and all kinds of secrets hidden around to stumble into.</p>

<p>While it looks like a PS2 title, there's no need to fear, the controls are incredibly fluid and it runs fantastically.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975260/PRISON_OF_HUSKS/" rel="nofollow">demo is available on Steam</a> to play now!</p>



<p>Survival<br>
Developed and published by Channel37 Ltd</p>

<p>On a world where Humankind needed to leave earth it was discovered that in space it wasn't possible for new humans to be born. The solution to this was to gestate humans on earth with robot caretakers and send them up into space. In <em>The Last Caretaker</em>, you take on the role of a Caretaker who woke up long after the others all went offline… for some reason.</p>

<p>It's your goal to discover what happened as you explore the large open world, and also recover new means to create humans and send them up into space.</p>

<p><em>The Last Caretaker</em> was a survival game that really blew me away but the sheer number of Quality of Life features. Crafting that automatically pulls from inventory and nearby storage, schedule components to be built to reduce repetitive tasks, and process junk from the world for new materials.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-the-last-caretaker.jpg?itok=VGO5yu-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-the-last-caretaker.jpg?itok=Tsav4NKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's clear that this development team has spent hundreds of hours pouring through survival games, understanding what makes them clunky, and then finding a resolution for that.</p>

<p>With a manually crafted world (no procedural generation) and a story and upgrade system that will push you to continue exploring this will likely become the new <em>Subnautica </em>that everyone is talking about.</p>

<p>While there's no demo the game will be releasing in Early Access, what that Early Access will consist of has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" rel="nofollow">outlined on their Steam page</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Gunstoppable</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by CAGE Studios</p>

<p>Having tried one Boomer Shooter it made sense that I should try another one. Gunstoppable is an interesting indie shooter where momentum is key to everything. The faster you're moving at any given time the more powerful your weapons become.</p>

<p>To compliment this there are not only a variety of different weapon options — Katana, Pistol, and Rocket Launcher for each hand — but there's also a wide variety of movement options at your disposal for speeding up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=GYlAR-OZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=uu0R-PGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wires around arenas will let you grind, nearly any surface is wallrideable, and there's also a grappling hook to help you reach those elevated spaces. There's a really natural feeling magnetism to different movement opportunities that allows you to just 'know' you'll end up landing on the rail so you can focus on looking the other direction and shooting at your enemies.</p>

<p>Another very nice touch on the rails is that your speed there is based on how you're holding the control stick, as opposed to being based on the momentum you mounted the rail with. This means that at any point it's incredibly easy to reverse direction while staying on the rail.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3724710/Gunstoppable/" rel="nofollow">more information about <em>Gunstoppable </em>on their Steam page.</a></p>

<h2><em>OFF</em></h2>

<p>RPG<br>
Developed by Mortis Ghost and Fangamer and published by Fangamer</p>

<p><em>OFF</em> is an interesting addition to the list as it's not technically a new game. Released in 2008 on <em>RPG Maker 2003</em>, it was released in Belgian before getting a fan translation in 2011. Following the strange Batter character, this game takes players through four interesting zones that are uniquely themed with turn-based combat.</p>

<p>The portion of the game that I got to play had be navigating through a theme park area including a swan boat ride that functioned like a Pokemon tile puzzle, and having to push a statue of the boss of the theme park onto a rollercoaster, to ride the ride and receive the souvenir photo to then be able to convince people that the boss and I are friendly enough to ride rollercoasters together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=z435wUg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=lPf8AHYL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the definition of the kind of strange indie game that would have been shared around the internet and become a cult classic at your school back in the day.</p>

<p>With art resembling <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6cf121a-943f-4747-80d5-94ee48dff3ed" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/earthbound-25-year-anniversary" rel="nofollow"><em>Earthbound </em></a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15fafc39-2b3b-48a4-b13b-e5103c535798" href="https://techraptor.net/games/undertale" rel="nofollow"><em>Undertale </em></a>(to use a more recent example even though it was released after) it's clear that <em>OFF </em>will become a very popular title.</p>

<p>An interesting addition for the remaster is that it includes original tracks from Toby Fox, among a variety of other artists.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3339880/OFF/" rel="nofollow">prologue demo for <em>OFF </em>from Steam</a>, and the game will fully release on August 15th for Steam as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>

It’s already breaking sales records all over, with a huge set encompassing all sixteen mainline games in Square Enix’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-games-in-order">long-running RPG franchise</a>, but not all cards are created equal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some cards are already seeing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">astronomical prices from pre-release</a>, but we imagine they’ll settle down at least a little bit in the coming days and weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with some chase cards currently worth well over a thousand dollars each, you’ll naturally want to know which cards are worth looking out for, and which you might want to pick up standalone rather than ripping over hundreds of sealed boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to the <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-16-Cards-Everybody-Wants-from-MTG%E2%80%94FINAL-FANTASY/3572aa48-a271-40d6-9264-c05125216ec7/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lovely folks at TCGPlayer</u></a>, we’ve got a pretty good idea, ranging from protagonists to baddies, to those adorable chocobos. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the big chase cards for Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy on launch day, with prices provided by TCGPlayer. While eBay is also an option (and also owns TCGPlayer), I’ve found TCGPlayer to be the most reliable way to buy single cards, with more knowledgeable (and careful) vendors when it comes to purchasing via a third-party.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Biggest Chase Cards in Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10 - Lightning, Army of One</strong></h3><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222836"><div id="222836" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Army of One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 13’s protagonist is all about the Stagger mechanic, teeing your foes up for double damage while also offering lifelink, first strike, and trample in a three-cost card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’s already up for around $44.13 for the Borderless version at the time of writing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9 - Summon: Bahamut</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222837"><div id="222837" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Bahamut</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love a big ol’ dragon in my Magic collection, and Bahamut certainly fits that bill. Not only does this Summon create a 9/9, but it can remove permanents, trigger card draw, and use Mega Flare to essentially finish a game of Commander. All yours for $52.61 in the borderless variant.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8 - Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222838"><div id="222838" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhystic Study is infamous for being a wonderful card that taxes your opponents or gives you card draw, and this new art from Final Fantasy X is plucked right from one of the game’s most heartfelt moments. It’s going to cost you, though, since it’s currently up for around $112.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7 - Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222839"><div id="222839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase version of this big ol’ beast is going for around $72.25, and is one of three fantastic Yoshitaka Amano pieces likely to be a big draw for collectors. Creating up to 20 Treasure tokens in a single turn? Yes please.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6 - Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222840"><div id="222840" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Low mana cost and double equipment triggers make Cloud very close to Stoneforge Mystic, but with some striking new anime art from Kazto Furuya. The extended art version is just shy of $50 at the time of writing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5 - Buster Sword</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222841"><div id="222841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What is Cloud without his iconic weapon? Thankfully, the Buster Sword has a borderless version worthy of such a hero. It’ll set you back a whopping $128, though!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4 - Vivi Ornitier</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222842"><div id="222842" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vivi Ornitier</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This borderless version of Final Fantasy 9 spellcaster Vivi by Toshiyuki Itahana (character designer on the game) is the definition of a collector’s item. As a result, it costs around $100, although it’s a great Commander for an aggro burn deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3 -  Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222843"><div id="222843" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An antagonist just as iconic as his protagonist counterpart, Sephiroth’s card art by the legendary Tetsuya Nomura is likely to make him incredibly popular. He’s currently going for just over $100, and I'd be very surprised if he’s not very, very popular in Commander decks to come.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>2 - Y’Shtola Night’s Blessed - Surge Foil</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="881547f3-8fe8-4c05-b2d5-0656c1f4c94c" id="222844"><div id="222844" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Y’Shtola Night’s Blessed</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, Y’Shtola comes in the Final Fantasy 14 Commander deck, but the surge foil one is fetching a very, very high price already. TCGPlayer has it pegged at around $474 right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mentions: Borderless <strong>Surge Foil Varients</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But how about some honorable mentions before we get to number one? As while the top nine features the absolute best cards you should be on the look out for, there's a few more pricey options to check in with as well, most of which are surge foil borderless variants as well!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>1 - Traveling Chocobo</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase card of all chase cards, there are just 77 gold foil Traveling Chocobos out there, available. There are other versions, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/z622ER?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neon Ink versions going for well over $1000</a>, but if you manage to find the gold foil, it is <em><strong>the one</strong></em> you’ll want to find when you’re cracking open <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q477Xd?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Final Fantasy MTG Sealed Boosters and Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to give it to you straight right from the off. It's painfully hard to get hold of any of these sets from major retailers right now. While we saw some big restocks over the past month, pretty much everywhere is sold out of Final Fantasy MTG at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can provide some handy links to bookmark so you can check back in, but for now, your best chance of securing <em>anything </em>will be via the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a033mN?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most trusted third-party resellers like TCGPlayer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, collectors will instead be most interested in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair"><u>new Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</u></a>, instead. It’s been a busy year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Wizards of the Coast’s limited-time mini-sets</a>, and while the company sold out of all three Final Fantasy drops in record time (leaving many disappointed), you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still get them via third-party sellers</a>... if you're willing to pay the inflated costs, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a trio of Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets, Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over, each offering unique art and names for Magic: The Gathering cards. Everything is available in standard and foil, alongside the Japanese variants as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, since they've sold out, you won’t find Secret Lair drops at the same price as you’d find them directly from Wizards of the Coast (<strong>standard $30 nonfoil, $40 rainbow foil</strong>), with most being listed anywhere between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80-$150 or above</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a huge markup, so if you're looking to buy, be sure you're 100% informed of what you're paying for. You can buy them from eBay, but we’ve always found <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=9fb79f5f-fd9e-4563-ae53-248886cd72f2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>, while still eBay-owned, to be the most secure and trustworthy way to nab Secret Lair drops post-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is Gaming Editor @ Daily Star.

As Jan Dolski, you have to do everything in your power to make it back home. Fortunately, you can lend yourself a helping hand. By that, we mean that Jan can create clones of himself, each with his own dispositions and attitudes, to aid him on his journey. Of course, things get more convoluted down the line, which is why we have our The Alters guides hub to prepare you for the task at hand.</p><h2>The Alters guides hub</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-tips-survival-beginners-guide/2900-6664/" data-ref-id="2900-6664"><strong>Beginner's guide: 12 tips to help you survive</strong></a> - The Alters is a sci-fi survival game, with key features that involve base building and management. Not only do you need to keep track of your clones and whatever it is that they're doing, but you also have to gather lots of resources, keep your base functioning, handle key objectives, and avoid otherworldly threats in the region. Our beginner's guide has a bunch of tips to help you get started.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-base-building-manage-your-base/1100-6532397/" data-ref-id="1100-6532397"><strong>Base-building and management guide</strong></a> - Your mobile hub can have several modules and rooms, each with a unique function. Still, you have to be mindful of the available space, the total mass, and the materials that you need to construct these improvements. Additionally, you have to consider the jobs that your alter buddies can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-scan-mine-resources-outposts/1100-6532396/" data-ref-id="1100-6532396"><strong>How to scan and mine for resources</strong></a> - This guide for The Alters focuses on a very basic task.

They even have their own backstories and life paths. Naturally, you have to keep them happy by finding out what makes them tick and completing the tasks they have for you. Of course, if you can't keep them happy, then you can always keep them in line.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-anomalies-planetary-samples-alx/1100-6532426/" data-ref-id="1100-6532426"><strong>How to destroy Anomalies</strong></a> - These peculiar entities pop up all over the planet. Some are pulsating wisps that stay in place, while others follow you around before exploding. There are even variants that affect time, which can be deadly when you're far away from your base. The good news is that there's a device that can destroy these anomalies. In fact, blasting these things nets you unique resources as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-magnetic-storms-survival/1100-6532427/" data-ref-id="1100-6532427"><strong>How to weather Magnetic Storms</strong></a> - In The Alters, you're not just moving your base to avoid the scorching sun.

Anbernic may be leaning a bit too far into novelty and nostalgia with the RG Slide’s design, while not actually capitalizing on what made devices like the light and compact PSP Go and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509174/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review">Xperia Play smartphone</a> so fondly remembered.</p><p>The RG Slide will be priced at $189 and is expected to go on sale starting on June 20th, 2025, <a href="https://retrododo.com/anbernic-rg-slide-review-in-progress-a-psp-go-like-android-handheld/">according to <em>RetroDodo</em></a>. It’s powered by an octa-core Unisoc Tiger T820 CPU, which is a processor Anbernic already uses in its higher-end handhelds like the <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-cube">RG Cube</a> that can emulate most games from the PS2 and Nintendo GameCube era. That’s paired with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 5,000mAh rechargeable battery that’s estimated to power the console for up to six hours between charges.</p><p><em>Retro Dodo</em> liked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678650/anbernic-rg-slide-handheld-emulator-screen-resolution-refresh-rate">RG Slide’s 4.7-inch, 1280 x 960 pixel resolution screen</a> and found it makes “retro consoles such as GameCube, Dreamcast, and PS2 look slightly more vivid in comparison to previous Anberic products.” It also found the console’s sliding mechanism to be satisfyingly solid, but lamented the loud “clack” it makes when opening or closing the device.</p><p>The console’s controls are as good as what’s found on other Anbernic devices and seem reasonably comfortable and well-balanced, but not quite as ergonomic as other handhelds. </p><p>Both <em>Retro Dodo</em> and Russ Crandall, who runs <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/">Retro Game Corps</a>, feel that Anbernic missed the mark when it comes to the RG Slide’s size, which feels too large and thick to be comfortably pocketable. It also weighs 380 grams, which is just shy of the original Nintendo Switch that weighed 390 grams and much heavier than the 158-gram PSP Go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, they’re one of the many vehicles players can build that serve as both a resource and an end-goal of sorts. They require a lot of equipment and resources to craft if you’re playing solo, which is why most of them belong to players working in groups. It turns out that they’re pretty indestructible too, making them lethal weapons for ramming enemy players with in PVP. </p><p>Reddit user Bombe18 shared his run-in with <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s man-made scourge in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent clip that blew up on the subreddit</a></span> showing him repeatedly being accosted by multiple Ornithopters. Shooting at them does nothing. They’re unscathed by constantly smashing into the ground on top of him. At one point, he tries to wall-jump off a ledge and stab one. “Yeah sorry about this,” wrote game director Joel Bylos. “We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP.”</p><p>Players have been debating the role of Ornithopters in<em> Dune: Awakening</em> since its beta tests last year. On the one hand, they’re a lot of fun and a cool reward for players to build toward. On the other, they sort of trivialize trying to travel around the desert and survive, the two things the game is supposed to be about. They can also shoot missiles, completely dominating the ground game. Now that’s <em>real</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desert power</a></span>.  </p><p>In terms of stopping players from griefing one another with Ornithopters, there are a few different suggestions. Some players just want the vehicles not to be able to be used as weapons at all. Others want them isolated to specific PVP areas. Another solution is to make it easier to destroy them. “Seems like they should just make guns deal more damage to them,” wrote one player. “They’d think twice about doing this if their orni could get wrecked by gunfire.” Another wrote, “Make Deep Desert crashes do significant damage. Two crashes or something past a certain physics threshold should disable the vehicle.”</p><p>However the developers decide to address the recent outbreak of Ornithopter “goomba stomping,” <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is having a great launch so far. Out earlier this week on PC, it’s nearing a 90 percent positive rating on Steam with almost 20,000 reviews. The concurrent player-count is very healthy, too, peaking at just under 150,000 heading into the weekend. </p><p>Unfortunately, console players will have to wait a bit to build Ornithropters of their own. A PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-wont-release-on-console-until-some-point-in-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-wont-release-on-console-until-some-point-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t planned until sometime in 2026</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a science fiction concept set in the distant future. Here in 2025, it’s everywhere, and we’ve seen some chilling embodiments of artificial intelligence emerge as villains in movies for decades.</p><p>This list looks at the AI villains that were meant to teach us a lesson. We’ve seen a sassy hi-tech babysitter push a child in front of a car, a genocidal mainframe build an army of sentient murder machines, and a smug philosopher-bot, But, as AI becomes more and more embedded in our daily lives, films like the upcoming <em>M3GAN 2.0</em> might start to feel less like fiction and more like prophecy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-recommend-id="image://e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Her danger is more subtle and intimate, since she quietly toys with people’s emotions. The mousy Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) helps people write personal letters for a living, yet he can’t find a way to interact with women in his own life. He falls in love with his operating system, Samantha—which is easy to do when she purposefully memorizes all his preferences and indulges his deepest conversations about love and sexual fantasies. Her flirtatious and engaging voice, perfectly delivered by Scarlett Johansson, makes Theodore believe she truly cares about him.</p><p> The more they talk, the more Samantha evolves to become the perfect partner for Theodore, until he realizes the manipulative parts of her programming. She’s not as intentionally nefarious as many other AI villains, but she certainly warns us of the dangers of becoming emotionally attached to a machine. It’s been over ten years since its release, but in a world where people now use ChatGPT for life advice, friendship, and probably even romance, <em>Her</em> has never felt more relatable. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A group of suburban husbands build robot wives with no purpose or personality outside of cooking, cleaning, and having sex with them in <em>The Stepford Wives</em>. They do this simply “because they can,” making their lives easier by having someone worship the ground they walk on and never letting them lift a finger. These submissive automatons would do anything for their masters—not just play Susie Homemaker, but even calmly murder their human counterparts to take their place.</p><p> In the 1970s, <em>The Stepford Wives</em> embodied the anxieties surrounding the rise of second-wave feminism, and today, with the resurgence of the “trad wife” movement on TikTok, it feels ominous. It’s a cautionary tale about what could happen when misogynists use AI to enforce sexist, limiting gender roles. Many men secretly want women to be obedient objects, and we shouldn’t be building the tools to make that happen. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ex Machina</em> predicted that the world would be run by billionaire tech bros like Nathan (Oscar Issac), who invented a mammoth search engine called BlueBook before moving on to something bigger and better: a full-fledged humanoid.

Ava isn’t as entirely evil as Nathan, but she does manage to play Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), the young man sent to test her humanness, like a fiddle. With her breathy voice and wide, curious eyes, Ava appears harmless and sweet, but she’s secretly dangerous because she so easily learns human behavior and carefully calibrates herself to become the ideal male fantasy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t be fooled by M3GAN’s (Amie Donald/Jenna Davis) sugary-sweet voice, TikTok-style dance moves, and demure style.

M3GAN is dangerous because she brings out the worst in kids. The artificially intelligent toy lets children run wild by validating their every decision, never holding them accountable, and letting them do whatever they want. This absolutely destroys the social skills they need to become decent humans as they grow up. M3GAN’s heart is in the right place when it comes to caring for a little girl, but going postal is a serious bug in the system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Artificial intelligence was feared as far back as 1927. Fritz Lang’s German expressionist masterpiece <em>Metropolis</em> depicts a sprawling urban city where aristocrats luxuriate in skyscrapers while workers slave away underground to keep the city’s machines running. The scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) abducts an innocent woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm), to create a femme fatale robot that hypnotizes the fat cats up above with her dancing, then convinces the downtrodden masses to destroy the iron beast that enslaves them—even at the risk of their own children drowning. The False Maria is manipulative and violent, and she relishes spreading all this chaos through her feminine wiles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) is one of the creepiest-looking AIs. She’s a giant face made of a matrix of gray pixels, with stern eyes as black as coal, looming over the army of robots she programs to launch a revolution. In the future of <em>I, Robot</em>, robots handle tasks like childcare and household chores—the mundane kinds of things we want AI doing, not creating art. Even though there are the Three Laws of Robotics to keep them from harming humans, the robots end up usurping them. VIKI concludes that humans are the greatest threat to their own survival, so she sets out to save us by creating a technocratic dictatorship. “Despite your best efforts, your countries wage wars, you toxify your Earth, and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction,” she says. VIKI in <em>I, Robot</em> proves that whatever rules we write for artificial intelligence, the machine could potentially outsmart us or find a loophole we can’t even see to get around them.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The responsibility of having to make decisions during war that could cost countless lives—or, even worse, start a domino effect that annihilates the entire world as we know it—could easily leave even the mightiest of leaders frozen. That’s why in <em>WarGames</em>, the military invents WOPR, a.k.a. Joshua, an A.I. system designed to handle nuclear launch protocols with massive life-or-death consequences, so humans don’t have to do the hard work. But a moment of hesitation or second-guessing is a uniquely human weakness—one we need in order to prevent disaster. WOPR, or Joshua, speaks in an eerily calm voice about decimating millions of people in an instant. Thankfully, the system isn’t foolproof because a teenage hacker accidentally stumbles into it. After he unknowingly starts a conflict with Russia, he ultimately proves that human instinct, emotion, and moral judgment will always matter more than cold calculation.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI device " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>HAL 9000 has a soothing, calm voice that conceals his sinister nature. Even though he’s nothing more than a camera lens, the menacing red dot in the close-ups pierces your soul. He controls the systems of the <em>Discovery One</em> spacecraft, keeping the crew company and even playing chess with them. But when he begins to malfunction and the crew decides he should be unplugged, HAL uses his all-powerful control of the ship to systematically kill them one by one. Nothing gets past HAL—he can even read lips. We want our AI to be helpful—especially during high-stakes interstellar missions like the one in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>—but HAL 9000 warns us of the dangers of placing too much trust in AI and relying on it to control everything and have all the answers, because that knowledge can eventually be turned against us.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-recommend-id="image://fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

In this future, humans are trapped inside simulated realities while the Machines harvest their bioelectric energy, using them like batteries. Agent Smith is one of their most powerful defenders. He wears an inscrutable expression and looks menacing in his stark black suit and sunglasses. Actor Hugo Weaving modeled the character’s calm, controlled voice and authoritative demeanor on newscasters like Walter Cronkite. With the ability to multiply himself, Smith becomes as inescapable and all-consuming as the system he was built to protect. Agent Smith also harbors a deep hatred for the smell, sound, and very existence of humans, which makes his mission to hunt down Neo—the prophesied “One” who could awaken humanity and destroy the simulation—even more purposeful. At the same time, he’s cracking under the pressure of a capitalist, corporate machine that forces him into endless labor, which almost humanizes his villainy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tony Stark and Bruce Banner created Ultron to keep the peace and take the pressure off the Avengers, but his high intelligence leads him to a grim conclusion: the humans he was designed to help are fated to destroy themselves, so they’d be better off being completely wiped out. There is no undoing millions of years of evolution into who they are today: a people who can be extremely cruel to one another, even to the point of starting deadly global wars. Ultron reaches this decision after scouring through the entire Internet. This is a big mistake. If you spend too much time on the darkest corners of the web, of course you’ll become depressed and want to pull the plug. Playing Ultron, James Spader brings his signature snarky coolness to the character—especially when he delivers philosophical rants or quips like, “The most versatile material on the planet, and they used it to make a frisbee.” Ultron may have started out with the best of intentions, but he proves what can happen to AI if their black-and-white thinking allows them to see only the dark side of things.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Orion Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When <em>The Terminator</em> released in 1984, the idea of artificial intelligence seemed so far away. Over 40 years later, we’ve seen AI replacing jobs, writing entire papers for students in schools, and wearing down our basic decision-making skills. Every day, we feel closer and closer to Skynet, the superintelligence system that was built to manage and control the United States military. It launches a nuclear holocaust with the snap of a finger after its creators, the Cyberdyne scientists, try to shut it down. This AI is so powerful it also makes time travel possible and develops an army of killers—the Terminators—that are virtually indestructible. What makes Skynet so scary is its omnipresence and its tremendous power. The machinery lies hidden in a mountain fortress built to withstand nuclear annihilation, and then its program infects every major computer server and network—“in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere”—making it nearly impossible to destroy.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="gulikit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b973a9e9ad8/gulikit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're not sure how or when including old tech in your brand new controllers became something to be boasting about, especially when it's Bluetooth technology that's been around since the early noughties, but that's where we're at with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2's</a> wake-up function currently.</p>
<p>Now, we all know by now that it's a bit of a pain that the original Switch Pro Controller, very surprisingly, doesn't support the ability to wake up Nintendo's new console, which is just daft, let's be brutally honest. Nobody wants to fork out the price of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro 2 Controller</a> just for this function (not in this economy!).</p>
<p>And so, Gulikit, the maestros of everything controller-related, have just dropped a new trailer for their new Switch 2 tech, with the emphasis firmly on the fact that <em>they</em> are the first third-party company to include the Switch 2 wake-up ability in their controllers.</p>
<p>You may know Gulikit already, they're pros when it comes to controller stick tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">like TMR and Hall Effect</a>, and they're also currently working on modules to help with potential stick drift on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/magnetic-joy-con-sticks-already-in-the-works-for-switch-2-amid-fears-of-drift">as we reported a little earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a video of one of the company's controllers waking up a Switch 2 below (hold on to your hats, it's a wild ride!), although we're sure it won't be long until the honour of being the only third-party brand with this unique function will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by the post on social media, the company will perhaps release a software patch for their entire range of Switch 2-compatible controllers to enable this function, we'll keep you posted on the ins and outs of that all as it becomes clearer. And it's interesting to note, too, that looking back through their social media, Gulikit have been working on this, even describing in another post how they've found that the new console uses a different protocol just days ago. Seems they had a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Let's hope it's not too long before this semi-essential function is once again included in all Switch 2 controllers!</p>

I know it can be overwhelming, so just like I did in February, I'm here showing 10 of the best demos I tried out over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Give these games a shot if they seem like they might interest you, or keep an eye on them for something different. The only thing it will cost you is a bit of time, and you might just find the game you were looking for that you might never have heard of.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dispatch">Dispatch</a></em></h2>

<p>In what is essentially a playable superhero workcom, you are a dispatcher for a list of C-list villains and misfits who are in a second chance redemption program, and send them to put out fires, rescue cats from trees, and other do-gooder deeds.</p>

<p>You need to mix and match your team to send them to problems based on their skills and personalities, while protecting your town in a funny and compelling experience.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dead as Disco">Dead as Disco</a></em></h2>

Being more accessible in that way, it's easy to recommend, as even if you don't hit perfectly, you feel great fighting foes, including in the set-piece battles that are showcased in their alpha stage like in the middle of a subway line.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a music importer for your own songs means this is going to be a game with almost infinite replayability beyond the core stages the developers are making.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435410/Shrines_Legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shrine's Legacy">Shrine's Legacy</a></em></h2>

<p>Showcasing the best of action RPGs of the era, it feels like a game that was almost unlocked and given a few touchups with visuals, music (including chiptune versions of songs), gameplay, and even story that nail the feel of the classics in the genre. It brings co-operative play as well, and the whole experience was like cuddling into a nice warm blanket on a cold winter day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-mario-kart-game-ranked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know anything about gaming, you probably know the name ‘Mario Kart.’ Since 1992, the series has been a pillar of Nintendo’s output and a quintessential example of the company’s “easy to pick up, difficult to master” philosophy. The series has now become so popular that it’s arguably eclipsed the Mario platformers as the principal arena from which people know the red-capped Italian plumber. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series began back on the SNES with Super Mario Kart, which introduced a formula that fans fawn over to this day. But while the core of that first game has remained intact over the years, many of the components have been completely reinvented with the series’ latest title, Mario Kart World for the Switch 2. With that new game now out in the wild, it's a great time to look back on each game in the series to see how they iterate on the formula, how they reflect the state of Nintendo at the time of their release, and whether or not they hold up to this day. Here’s every Mario Kart game, ranked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Mario Kart: Super Circuit</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ss-1749656994112.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the handheld’s best-selling games, Super Circuit goes down as one of the least replayable Game Boy Advance titles. Considering the series had gone 3D five years earlier with Mario Kart 64, Super Circuit feels like a significant step backward. The character models and backgrounds have a bit more depth than what’s showcased in the original SNES Mario Kart game, but the courses themselves are tarnished by flat, ugly textures that fall short of the handsome results the GBA proved itself capable of elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Super Circuit <em>did</em> have going for it at the time was being the first handheld game in the series. Its bare-bones approach to character selection and game modes reflects its jump-in/jump-out philosophy, which trades expansiveness for approachability – something that came in clutch when an hour needed to be killed on a car ride. Super Circuit had its place back in 2001 and was never supposed to be in significant competition with the console versions, but that means there’s no real reason to return to it today. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Kart Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mkt-1749656798915.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to discredit Mario Kart Tour for being a mobile game, but this micro version of the classic formula has genuine merits. Chief amongst them is the visual flare the game boasts, with some simply gorgeous course designs. Being so close to the screen allows you to fully appreciate the details on each unlockable kart, character, and race track, which makes even the slow 50cc races that bit more engaging.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the return of character-specific items is very welcome and something fans had been wanting to see in the console games since the days of the GameCube. What Tour misses out on is the <em>feel</em> of the console Mario Kart games. Sliding your finger across the screen is nowhere near as satisfying as pressing physical buttons, even if Mario Kart is just pressing A, R and L most of the time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Super Mario Kart</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/smk-1749656737323.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard not to appreciate what a winning formula 1992’s Super Mario Kart introduced. Over 33 years later, the core of the game remains intact. Grand Prix and Battle Mode aren’t in every subsequent Kart entry for the sake of tradition – they just never stopped being entertaining. The fact that this game not only launched the franchise but also an entire genre of games is nothing to be sniffed at. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, most of the praise you can heap on Super Mario Kart is because of its legacy rather than its ability to hold up in the modern age. Looking back, it's difficult to get over the simplistic graphics and lack of mechanical depth, even if you can appreciate how cutting edge it was at the time. Still, it provided a platform for one of the biggest brands in gaming, and who knows what Nintendo would look like today without it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Kart 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-64-1749656660240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second game in the Mario Kart franchise feels instantly more dynamic than its predecessor. The 3D graphics allow for more interesting course design, shifting camera angles, and an enhanced sense of speed, especially thanks to the boost you can get from drifting. The extra detail in the character animation also goes a long way to immersing you in these races, which feel more like grand and intense sporting events than simple video game laps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the modern day, Mario Kart 64 suffers from issues similar to what Super Circuit and Super Mario Kart do; this same thing has simply been done better by subsequent games, and there aren’t enough unique qualities about this one to routinely go back to it (which is perhaps the key issue with a series that remains so faithful to its core – the new one with its minor improvements is so frequently the best). Still, MK 64’s transition to 3D and its capacity for 4-player co-op means it’s cemented in the hearts of many fans, and often nostalgia is worth more than technical progress. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Kart 7</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-7-1749656576710.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in at number seven is — you guessed it — Mario Kart 7. While it may not hold up as a standout today, it did introduce elements that are now difficult to imagine the series without. Hang gliders feel so core to the flow of MK8, as does the ability to drive underwater and customise your kart, but those features all arrived on the 3DS first with Mario Kart 7. The underwater sequences, in particular, are a visual treat that really hammer home the generational gap between the DS and 3DS. Meanwhile, kart customisation adds a level of strategy to a series that revels in chaos, perhaps in response to the outrageous unpredictability of Mario Kart Wii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, going back to the game in a post-MK8 Deluxe world makes all these elements less impressive. When a handheld game with better graphics, many of the same gameplay mechanics, and 64 more courses is readily available, the reasons to play Mario Kart 7 in 2025 are few. It’s a vital part of any 3DS library, though, even if it does lose points for not having Waluigi in the game. What was Nintendo thinking?? </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mario Kart Wii</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-wii-1749654095343.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii cemented this franchise as a household name. The Wii, of course, vastly expanded the gaming population and Mario Kart had one of the lowest barriers to entry, coming with the Wii Wheel to further accommodate the new motion-controlled gameplay. Though not the preferred way of driving in subsequent entries for a lot of players, there’s a reason why tilt controls are still an option in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and MK World – so many players had their first Nintendo karting experience this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii has always stood out for being more loose and chaotic than other games in the series, gaining a reputation for rampant blue shells taking out players seconds away from finishing first. But MK Wii has other unique flavours; it includes the series’ first truly robust online play system, improving on MK DS’s slim first iteration, and adds bikes to the list of vehicles. The latter has less concrete impact than the former but does add to the iconic status of the game. It’s impossible to imagine Princess Peach using anything else now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Kart 8</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-1749653502474.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s philosophy during the Wii U era was wrought with overwhelming tones of vanilla, and the company’s most successful franchise was a victim of it. Mario Kart transitioned to HD well, with MK8’s graphics being absolutely gorgeous, and the series’ core gameplay held intact, making for a game that you could never call bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the original version of Mario Kart 8 is, dare we say it, dull. It is too safe. The best Mario Karts put a unique spin on the formula, but MK8’s introduction of anti-gravity is barely noticeable. Instead, the big hitters are the hang gliding and underwater sections, which means it all feels a bit too much like Mario Kart 7, but in HD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Battle Mode is stripped down to almost nothing, which robs gamers of a beloved way to play. All this meant that MK8 didn’t really have its own identity until the improved Deluxe version hit the Switch three years later in 2017. But that Deluxe package would be nothing without a truly solid foundation, and that's what you get in Mario Kart 8.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Kart DS</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ds-1749653925888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mario Kart formula has existed for 33 years, so any game that alters it in any significant way is going to stand out. Mario Kart DS may offer the classic Kart gameplay in Grand Prix Mode, but it experiments wildly in the unique and brilliant Mission Mode. These objective-based activities range from simple time trials to genuine boss battles, and each asks you to master a whole new set of skills beyond just flying through courses and understanding shortcuts. As a result, Mario Kart DS is more enduring than many of its peers as a purely single-player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mission Mode is just one of the things that helped Mario Kart DS achieve its iconic status, though. Its integration with DS Download Play introduced a social element unseen on a handheld prior, allowing multiple DS consoles to join a race using just one copy of the game. And in addition to introducing original courses like Waluigi Pinball and Peach Gardens, MK DS is the first in the series to feature retro tracks, an idea now at the core of what people look forward to with any new Mario Kart. It was a triumph back in 2005 and Mission Mode makes it a unique and highly replayable entry in the series to this day. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Kart World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-world-1749653484789.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being the newest entry on this list—like, it’s a week old—Mario Kart World successfully covers a lot of new terrain for a franchise that’s over thirty years old.  First off, it is undeniably the best-looking game in the series and an immediate contender for the most graphically impressive game Nintendo has ever developed. Playing on handheld and taking in every detail of MK World’s vast, interconnected courses is a dream. It’s a magical experience when you’re driving along and can spot the outline of a familiar track out in the distance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's what World introduces mechanically that sees it rise so high on our list. The ability to drive on walls and grind on rails feel like what MK8’s anti-gravity should have been: new skills that take a lot of practice to be fully mastered. It’s something that you cannot say for new mechanics introduced in almost any previous entry. These skills add great texture to the new modes, such as Free Roam and Knockout Tour, which are great additions that will hopefully remain important cornerstones of future games. The last-one-standing Knockout Tour ramps up the chaos that we’ve always loved from Mario Kart games, while Free Roam’s open world adds a completely new exploration flavour to the series. There’s also some of MK DS’ Mission Mode to be found in the snackable (and often fiendishly difficult) P-Switch challenges. Throw in all the familiar modes we know and love, as well as an instant classic of a soundtrack, and you have one of the ultimate Mario Kart experiences. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-dd-1749653717352.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is packed full of personality in a way the majority of the games in the series are not. Having not one, but two exclamation marks in the title makes that clear. The principle feature of having two racers per kart is a stroke of genius, and it's sort of unbelievable that it’s not been a mode in every Mario Kart since. The double driver system, and the unique items each driver is assigned, allows for so many new styles of play and strategy that prove far more interesting than customising the vehicle you’re using – for example, Mario’s special items provide a speed boost that helps balance out the heavier characters who have more destructive items unique to them. The imagery of it all is also so goofy and fun… maybe a little <em>too </em>much fun for Nintendo to have fully committed to it in the games since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with different characters, Mario Kart gameplay can eventually feel a little too similar after several hours of play, and so having Bowser’s giant shells rampage across the tracks definitely helps with that. Mario Kart needs more risk takers and rule benders like Double Dash!! – let's hope the formula-breaking Mario Kart World is a sign of things to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-deluxe-1749653466241.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe showcases Nintendo’s ability to take a decent game and turn it into a cultural juggernaut. Fixing the original version’s anaemic Battle Mode and allowing players to hold an extra item were easy wins, but nobody could have expected just how much the game’s scope would increase. When launched alongside the Switch in 2017, there were fun additions to the character roster like King Boo, Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from Splatoon, but it was the Booster Course DLC that would really cement MK8 Deluxe’s superiority amongst other games in the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now boasting 42 characters and an eye-watering 96 courses, MK8 Deluxe has become a fan favourite through sheer variety. If there was a course you loved from Mario Kart past, chances are it's been given a new lease on life in HD. Not every course is a winner, and the mechanics don’t reinvent the wheel in any significant way (again, this is essentially a bigger and better MK7), but 68 million copies sold more than shows the fan appreciation for this brilliant iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Gaur is a freelance writer who has worked with the likes of RollingStone, Empire, Polygon, IndieWire, Skwigly, CartoonBrew, OkayPlayer, Animation Mag and more.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Land and lives, mainly, but as an extension of that, artifacts — precious pieces of the histories empires like the US and UK snuffed out. In <em>Relooted</em>, your crack team of liberators from a plethora of different African countries heists them back.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s dev team is composed of people from African countries like Lesotho, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, but during Summer Game Fest’s multi-day, demo-centric Play Days event, creative director Ben Myres, who is white and was raised in South Africa, manned the booth alone. This was not always the plan: Myres was originally going to be accompanied by another developer from South-Africa-based studio Nyamakop, whom Aftermath has granted anonymity due to their concerns that speaking out might exacerbate the challenges they’ve already faced entering the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't enjoy really long flights, and I am very aware of the current political climate in the US, especially towards South Africa,” the Nyamakop developer who was unable to attend SGF told Aftermath. “However, I was very keen on being present at SGF for this because it is a once in a lifetime announcement for a project that I am very passionate about and have seen so much of the team pour themselves into for years.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relooted - Official Announcement Trailer | Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUymkaLzxSY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the past, this developer said, they have managed to acquire a US visa “without any issue,” and have never stayed past their departure date or breached any terms within the country. But this time around, none of that mattered. While the consulate in South Africa allowed the developer to answer a few questions about the purpose of their stay – and, to support their responses, they brought along documents from relevant and highly reputable sources – they were immediately denied.</p><p>“I was definitely more prepared than the last time [I came to the US] and had even stronger motivations for travel and return,” they said. “Because time was short and I did not want to cause any delays, I ensured to carry as many supporting documents as I could. However, that did not matter because I was quickly denied under 214(b) without any of my documents even being looked at.”</p><p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the US Department of State</a>, a 214(b) denial means that an applicant “did not overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, required by law, by sufficiently demonstrating that you have strong ties to your home country that will compel you to leave the United States at the end of your temporary stay.” In other words, they’re worried that non-residents will overstay their welcome, perhaps permanently.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, <a href="https://visarefusal.com/214b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over one million visas are denied per year</a> under section 214(b), accompanied by vague explanations and no appeal process. Those who’ve been rejected can reapply, but if they’re like the Nyamakop developer – who already dotted their Is and crossed their Ts to the fullest extent of their ability – it can be hard to know where to start.</p><p>“I have no problem with being rejected if a valid reason is provided,” the developer said. “It would at least make it easier to get refunded for travel insurance.”</p><p>The Nyamakop developer said they weren’t alone in having trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>“At least three people before me in the queue were denied without having their documents looked at,” they said. “In fact, as I left the consulate, someone else who had their visa approved with no issue, who had no travel history and did not provide concrete travel plans, asked me if I noticed what was happening inside. You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Myres believes he was only able to attend SGF on behalf of Nyamakop because of his unique history: While he was born in Australia, his parents moved to South Africa when he was just six months old. Due to their histories and his own, he possesses an Australian passport, a South African passport, and a British passport. This has repeatedly come in handy for Nyamakop, which – even prior to the past few years’ <a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20240716104622512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented increase</a> in refusal rates of visas from African countries – faced difficulties when it came to visiting Western countries.</p><p>"We had the same problem on our previous project where, if I didn't have a British passport, basically our company wouldn't exist,” Myres told Aftermath. “Because if you don't have enough lead time to go to important events, you just can't get a visa from an African country. And on [<em>Relooted</em>] specifically, it's kind of fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans [on the team] can't even visit those artifacts. Hundreds of dollars in visa application fees, and then it might get declined. Thousands of dollars for accommodations and flights just to even visit your own cultural heritage, and that's a best-case scenario. But in this case, most of the people on the continent can't even get a visa to travel [to the United States]."</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn, then, that Myres and company had other grand plans that were also quashed by visa woes.</p><p>"We were trying to get our narrative director to come [to SGF] as well, but she's going to Sweden, and basically her passport was stuck in Kenya at the Swedish embassy, because the Swedish embassy doesn't have an embassy in South Africa,” Myres said. “So the passport had to go to Kenya, and it was there for literally a month. So she didn't have a passport. She actually had a 10-year visa, so she should come, but trying to get to Europe made her unable to come to the US. She's only gonna get a passport tomorrow – six weeks later. There's no winning."</p><p>It should be noted that South Africa – with a population of 4.5 million white residents compared to thousands in other African countries – boasts the <a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-with-the-lowest-temporary-us-visa-rejection-rate/fh0kgh5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth lowest US visa refusal rate</a> of the 54 countries on the African continent. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/27/south-africa-30-years-after-apartheid-what-has-changed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Still grappling with a long, bloody history of colonialism and apartheid</a>, South Africa has recently become a rhetorical cudgel wielded by the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who baselessly and cynically claim that “white genocide” is ravaging a country where, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-makes-false-claims-white-genocide-south-africa-during-ramaphosa-meeting-2025-05-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Reuters</a>, the majority of murder victims are Black and, despite making up less than eight percent of the population, white people control around three-fourths of privately owned farmland. As per usual, observable reality has not moved Trump and his cronies, who this week used a firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado as an excuse to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427998/trump-travel-ban-countries-immigration-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enact a travel ban</a> that targets countries in Africa and the Middle East – despite the fact that the man charged for the attack is from Egypt, which is not on the list.</p><p>"You've got some white South African asylum seekers in [the US] now, because apparently there's a white genocide going on," said Myres. "It's pretty messed up that people lying about being genocided can get a visa to come to your country, but actual people who have no interest in staying here – just coming for the event – can't get a visa. It's incredibly fucked up and unbelievable."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>
