            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-presents-february-2025-officially-revealed-for-next-week.1114269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has officially announced a Pokemon Presents presentation for next week, and as you've probably come to expect by now, it's set to air on Pokemon Day.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/pokemon/status/1759850669333160265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Pokemon X account, the latest Pokemon Presents showcase is set for February 27th at 6am Pacific. That's around 9am Eastern and about 2pm GMT, in case you're wondering.</p>

<p>We don't yet know how long the showcase will be, but previous Pokemon Presents videos have been anywhere from around 10 minutes long to about 25 minutes, so expect something that's somewhere in that time range.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=7PfFw3mp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=L2p6k6D_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we finally be about to get more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info?</figcaption></figure><p>If past form is anything to go by, we can probably expect some updates for currently-running&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>(whose developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">might be about to sell up to Saudi Arabia's PIF</a>).</p>

<p>We can potentially also expect a new announcement or two, so this showcase might give us our first glimpse of the next major generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>The timing would track; the mainline games have been launching roughly every three years for the past few generations, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, so this year feels like the perfect time to announce whatever the next games will be.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is the Copperajah in the room at this point. We haven't heard much more about the game since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">its announcement during last year's Pokemon Presents show</a>, so hopefully, we'll get more info about it next week.</p>




<p>The timing of next week's Pokemon Presents might be slightly inconvenient for Nintendo given that the recently-revealed Switch 2 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to get its own Direct showcase in April</a>.</p>

<p>If Nintendo reveals any&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games coming to Switch 2, it might be jumping the gun on the console's launch lineup announcement (which will presumably come in April), but only covering games coming to the original Switch feels a touch odd in the shadow of the new console as well.</p>

<p>In any case, the next Pokemon Presents is due to air on February 27th at 6am Pacific. You can watch it over on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel.</p>

                <p>A recent report said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was at one point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-could-have-shuttered-xbox-prior-to-major-acquisitions-report/1100-6528826/" data-ref-id="1100-6528826">mulling the possibility of shuttering the Xbox division</a>. Before this, Microsoft's own co-founder Paul Allen's investment company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cofounder-s-investment-group-calls-for-xbox-spinoff/1100-6415919/" data-ref-id="1100-6415919">called for Microsoft to dump Xbox and spin it off as a separate business</a>. That never happened, and now Nadella is speaking up to express Microsoft's commitment to gaming. He told <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarkesh Patel</a> that it's not true that Microsoft's investments in gaming is part of some kind of "means to some other end."</p><p>Microsoft has a long history of supporting gaming, Nadella pointed out, referencing how Microsoft Flight Simulator was a Microsoft product before the company even made the first version of Windows.</p><p>"So, gaming has got a long history at the company, and we want to be in gaming for gaming's sake. I always start by saying I hate to be in businesses where they're means to some other end. They have to be ends unto themselves," he said.</p><p>Nadella's comments came in response to a question about if Nadella had some kind of "premonition" about how gaming could help contribute to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Microsoft's push into the artificial intelligence space by using games to train its models. </a></p><p>"We are a company where we have to bring all these assets together and be better owners by adding value. For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge. Ninja Theory has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Muse won't be use to make games</a>, but instead to help empower humans to work faster.</p><p>"I think about gaming data as perhaps, you know, what YouTube is perhaps to Google, gaming data is to Microsoft. And so therefore I'm excited about that," Nadella said.</p><p>AI is a controversial technology within the gaming space and across numerous other businesses. A recent GDC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">study</a> found that the majority of game studios worldwide use generative AI already, despite concerns about the technology. Microsoft itself has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">gone on record saying advancements to AI will lead to job losses</a> in the short term but may lead to more opportunities in the long term. Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 people in the past year in gaming roles, though whether or not the reduction had anything to do with AI is unknown. Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-hits-40m-after-seattle-studio-shut-down.1114251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit another major player count milestone, just a couple of days after the company closed the Seattle studio responsible for developing the hero shooter.</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fiscal year as a whole), NetEase confirms that <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has amassed "over 40 million players to date".</p>

<p>The game, which launched in early December, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">amassed 10 million players</a> within its first 72 hours on release, going on to hit 20 million players in less than two weeks. It's worth stressing, however, that these aren't necessarily active players, just "registered users".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=M_PowDQp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=qVzOyGKX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit 40 million players, but that didn't stop NetEase closing its development studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, a quick look at&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' Steam numbers (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) shows that it's attracted 320,376 players over the last 24 hours, with 130,699 players enjoying the game at time of writing.</p>

<p>NetEase also says that the first season of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>resulted in a new surge of interest in the game, causing the hero shooter to catapult to the top of Steam's top sellers and most-played charts when it arrived.</p>

<p>All of this, as well as what is clearly NetEase's continued faith in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, makes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">decision to lay off everyone at the Seattle-based studio</a> responsible for making the game even more baffling.</p>

<p>In a statement, NetEase said the decision was made "for organizational reasons" and in order to "optimize development efficiency", so in other words, it's all to do with corporate behind-the-scenes goings-on, which is pretty much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">exactly what you'd expect</a> in this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">day and age</a>, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=AoK2Gm_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=KPMVE0pW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase is pledging to support&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for a long time to come.</figcaption></figure><p>As for NetEase's financials, they're not much to write home about. The company reported a very small revenue increase for the 2024 fiscal year, going from 2023's total of around $14.2 billion to about $14.4 billion in 2024.</p>

<p>Gross profit also increased slightly, as did net income. NetEase's fiscal year ended on December 31st, so these figures do probably include&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' numbers, but NetEase doesn't provide a full breakdown of exactly how much the shooter made for it last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, NetEase says it's got a pretty stacked slate of games to come, including mobile shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, hero FPS&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Marvel Mystic Mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>The studio is, however, also pulling funding or pausing projects for several of its other investments, including&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a> and Mac Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Untold Worlds</a>, among others. We'll have to wait and see what all of this means for NetEase's bottom line in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/el-paso-elsewhere-2-officially-announced-by-xalavier-nelson.1114248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold have announced&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, a followup to the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-influenced 2023 shooter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lil6pnx6hk23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on his Bluesky account, Nelson says that it's "early days" for the sequel, but shares a title page for what is presumably its script. The page is pretty barren; it simply gives the name of the game, i.e.&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, and Nelson's name as a writing credit.</p>

<p>Amusingly, a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/glassbottommeg.bsky.social/post/3likzdm4gus24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">couple of replies</a> give potential <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3likzmdt7ok2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">names</a> for the game, including&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere, All at Once</em>, referencing the popular 2022 comedy movie. Of course, the game will probably just end up being called&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>. Ho hum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=X5Pdwdqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=BepxPOEY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>is officially happening, Xalavier Nelson has announced.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em>, it's a "third-person love letter to classic shooters" developed by Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>The game revolves around James Savage, troubled protagonist and&nbsp;<em>Blade</em>-style enemy to vampires. Savage must descend into a motel that's suddenly gained a few extra floors thanks to a vampiric incursion.</p>

<p><em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>features a fully original hip-hop soundtrack composed by Nelson himself, and presumably, the sequel will feature more of Nelson's musical talents. It's also got "hordes of destructible physics objects", a fully-voiced campaign, and plenty of&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-style slow-motion dives.</p>

<p>Naturally, we're almost certainly too early on in the development of&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>to know what it'll play like, but if you want a refresher, you can check out the launch trailer for the original game here.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>itself, Remedy recently revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which are being developed in conjunction with Rockstar, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">are "making steady progress"</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, they don't yet have a release date, so if you want to remind yourself how much fun <i>Max Payne&nbsp;</i>and games inspired by it can be, you can check out&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010236" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/el-paso-elsewhere/9P1H1KJB032N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

And in a lot of ways it does feel cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, but there are also some very important ways in which it doesn’t. The biggest of those is speed. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unless you’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257">mastered <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span> across multiple playthroughs, it can have a deceivingly plodding pace. You can run, jump, and explore anywhere you want. But <em>Elden Ring</em>, like other FromSoftware games, quickly teaches you to be wary of leaping before you look. Unexpected hazards and low-level enemies threaten to kill unsuspecting players around every corner. Through trial and error, <em>Elden Ring </em>trains its tarnished to be cautious, watchful, and prepared. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180"><em>Nightreign</em> is the opposite of that</a></span>. The multiplayer roguelite is not technically a battle royale, but it can often feel like one. Giant birds carry you through the sky and drop you off at specified locations. A damage-dealing ring of blue light is constantly closing in around you and your teammates across a randomized map based on the original game’s Limgrave. You then race to grind XP and collect loot before a day-night cycle ends with a showdown against a past FromSoftware boss at the center of the map. <br></p><p>I played a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..">few hours of <em>Nightreign</em>’s network test last weekend</a></span> and was surprised just how much the game encourages you not to dilly-dally. In addition to moving much, much faster than you do in <em>Elden Ring</em>, you also have to race against the clock to level up and find better gear in preparation for the scaling difficulty of the ensuing encounters. I thought our random trio would be methodically canvasing the map for secrets and fighting at one another’s backs. Instead, exploration was a chaotic scramble to ransack the map. </p><p>That is not the type of experience I associate with <em>Elden Rin</em>g, but that doesn’t make it a bad one. In some ways, <em>Nightreign</em> is closer to a multiplayer <em>Hades</em> than a traditional Soulsborne. Its action is more arcade-y, and the runs progress quickly and efficiently. And what can feel like a shallow free-for-all in the beginning comes into sharper focus during the boss fights which pit players against everything from Margit, The Fell Omen to a pack of three-headed hounds that spit fire. Here the pace slows back down some and offers a deep challenge more inline with the learning curves and the satisfying games of cat-and-mouse I associate with <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. </p><p>My squad and I weren’t able to finish any runs, ultimately dying each time to the Cerberus Night Lord with only half its health depleted. While you can revive companions by hacking away at their downed corpses, health potions are still finite and the last leg of the boss fight eventually depleted both our resources and our resolve. But even in failure I immediately wanted to plunge back into <em>Nightreign </em>and start a new run, not usually the feeling I get from  repeatedly dying in a FromSoftware game. That tells me <em>Nightreign</em>, while unorthodox, is on the right track, perhaps especially for those like me who enjoy the studio’s games but aren’t ride-or-die fans of them. </p><p>It helps that each run, win or lose, nets you new Relics that can be equipped for better stat bonuses on subsequent attempts. It’s this  loop, coupled with multiple classes (eight in the full game) and the teamwork around boss fights, that gives <em>Nightreign</em> a bit of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot flavor within its larger roguelite RPG framework. It’s not trying to be a live-service game, but it is the kind of thing I see myself getting the crew together to play in between <em>Rocket League</em> matches and <em>Helldivers 2</em> missions. It’s already been revealed that additional bosses and character classes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will eventually arrive in DLC</a></span>.

<p>Soulslike originators and imitators dominate the action-gaming scene. While this isn’t bad, the release of Lost Soul Aside could be a blessing in disguise for lovers of classic action titles with a sharp hack ‘n’ slash edge.</p>



<p>Let me preface by saying I need a Souls game every once in a while. Something to grind me down, make me feel useless, but make me feel like a God once I fell a great opponent—after an hour or two. I need insignificant mobs to cut me down and reduce me to human rubble. But even I’ll admit the genre has become saturated, so much so the art of a hack ‘n’ slash has died.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-2-black-remastered-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Remake</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> are almost remnants of a genre that used to be. But the tide could be turning with the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-lost-soul-aside-come-out">When Does Lost Soul Aside Come Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Lost Soul Aside releases on May 30 for multiple platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Did you know the thought process and development of Lost Soul Aside began in 2016? So this has been cooking for a while. The game’s director and company CEO Yang Bing has described Lost Soul Aside in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-may-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> as: “Fluid, fast, and stylish that you never want to put the controller down. Kaser’s shape-shifting weapon adapts to your combat style. Are you a precise swordsman? A fan of devastating ranged attacks? Maybe you like high-speed mobility? Whatever your preference, the different type of weapons will serve you well.”</p>



<p>There’s a distinct and almost unmistakable Devil May Cry vibe about Lost Soul Aside. With less attention being given to DMC, Lost Soul Aside has the chance to fill a void.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-platforms">Lost Soul Aside Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Expect to pick up a copy of Lost Soul Aside on either the PlayStation 5 or PC.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox love for Lost Soul Aside at present. Only the PlayStation 5 and PC are getting full launches for Ultizero Games’ new action title. The size, scale, and sheer detail of Lost Soul Aside make me question if a future <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port is possible. But never say never!</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-editions-amp-price">Lost Soul Aside Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, a Lost Soul Aside Standard Edition ($59.99/£59.99) and Digital Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£69.99) are the only ones available to purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Most new games come with at least three editions. That’s how I’ve been conditioned to think, so it shocks me when a AAA title only had a Standard and Deluxe Edition to choose from. It’s healthier on the wallet though.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at each edition and its price—so far.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Lost Soul Aside Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £59.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Digital Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Hack ‘n’ slash fans are eyeing up Lost Soul Aside with great attraction. It seeks to fill a hole in the gaming market left untouched for a while now. What is about Lost Soul Aside that appeals to you the most? Drop a comment and let us know.</p>

			<p>Despite dropping the mandatory PlayStation Network account sign in for single-player games on PC, looking at Lost Soul Aside, it looks like any single-player game published on PC by Playstation Publishing could still be blocked in unsupported countries.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-region-blocked-in-130-countries.1113747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1235001/info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Database </a>currently shows that the upcoming game developed by Ultizero Games will not be available for purchase in the 130 countries where the PlayStation Network is not available, despite mandatory account log-in having been dropped from the game as it was for other single player only games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-account-requirements-on-pc-dropped-for-spider-man-2-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-two-more-games/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part II Remastered and God of War Ragnarok</a>. Hopefully, this is just a leftover of the mandatory account login that has now been removed and will be rectified before launch.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside has been in development for a very long time, but its release is finally right around the corner<span>. It will launch, as confirmed during the latest PlayStation State of Play, which aired last week on<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;May 30th</a>. As mentioned above, the game originally required a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Network account sign in</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/">&nbsp;to play</a>, but now users in countries supported by the PlayStation Network won't require an account to play the game on Steam.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software beta update is now available for users invited to test it out before the public release, introducing new Activities improvements, and more.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-feb-25.1114107/">ResetERA forums</a>, the new firmware update introduces new Activity improvements that make it easier for users to view details by fully displaying them on the card itself while still keeping spoilers hidden. The update also introduces support for Unicode 16.0 emojis, some Parental Control changes, improved system software performance and stability, and enhanced message usability on some screens. So, all in all, this looks like a minor update, although more features and improvements could be added before the update goes live for all users.</p>
<p>Activities, in particular, have been receiving some attention in recent PlayStation 5 system software updates, as the latest update, update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-07-10-20-00-performance-improvements/">24.07-10.20.00</a>, made it so that each activity will display its current status. Besides improving specific features and enhancing firmware performance and stability, the latest updates have been pretty light since the latest major update, 24.06, which introduced the Welcome Hub, new Remote Play improvements, new personalized 3D audio profiles, and more. Everything that was introduced in the latest major PlayStation 5 system software update can be found in detail <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">here.</a></p>

            <p>Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, the saying goes. (This is why so many games journalists are unemployed - ba-dum tish.) Thankyfully the next expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> seems to understand the permeable boundary between passion project and career as purely aspirational. It's called Businesses &amp; Hobbies and it lets Sims open their own tattoo parlour, pottery studio or - if you have the right complementary expansion - a cat café.

<p>Expansion packs are the largest of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> various DLC types, adding both new content and new mechanics, and Businesses &amp; Hobbies seems pretty rich. Your new businesses can offer a range of services, from classes to products to services like tattooing, with players able to tweak pricing, hire staff, and denote areas of shops that are accessible to staff only.
</p>
<p>Within that template, there's seemingly a lot of detail been added to the new skills. Tattooing, for example, will let you design your own custom designs, drawing on the skin of your Sims or using clipart-style shapes. You'll need your Sim to get gradually better at the skill if they're going to have happy customers, though, and there's a new mentorship system that allows your Sim to learn from existing experts in the field.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the aspirational element I referenced above, the expansion also adds two new cities, at least one of which looks to be somewhat inspired by Copenhagen, here rendered as "Nordhaven". Northern European countries seem like the sort of place where owning a successful small business or pursuing a creatively fulfilling careers might still be possible.
</p>
<p>I referenced cat cafés as one potential small business, but it's worth noting that this particular flavour of business is only available if you also own the previous Cats And Dogs expansion. There are several other previous expansions that can function alongside this new one, letting you open an acting school (Get Famous expansion), a spa (Spa Day Game Pack), or a laundromat (Laundry Day stufff pack). All of the details of complementary DLC <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/businesses-and-hobbies-expansion-pack">are listed in the announcement on The Sims site</a>.
</p>
<p>The Sims 4's Businesses &amp; Hobbies expansion pack will launch on March 6th. In the meantime why not check out our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4-best-packs-guide-all-dlc-packs-explained">best Sims 4 expansions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will be released on April 13, 2025, and will consist of seven episodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-hbo-1236268901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, HBO announced The Last of Us Season 2’s release date and episode yesterday. The upcoming season will consist of seven episodes adapting the story of the second game from Naughty Dog’s series. It was revealed in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this month that each episode “packs quite a wallop,” and it is likely that the “story will extend past a Season 3.”</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 1 covered the entire first game of the series, so it will be interesting to see how Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann will divide the events from the second game across multiple seasons. However, the showrunners have reduced the number of episodes from 9 in Season 1 to 7 in Season 2. The creators will also mess around with time and how things are placed in a way that is appropriate for the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 featured new cast members for popular characters from the second game, such as Isabela Merced as Dina and Kaitlyn Dever as Abby. The trailer also included some intense sequences with hordes of the infected creating havoc in different locations, like the camp, abandoned subway station, and more. </p>

            <p>
Last night, Microsoft trumpeted the announcement of Muse, a new "generative AI breakthrough" designed to aid "gameplay ideation".
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">published some grainy-looking gifs</a> of AI-generated gameplay footage, based on Xbox studio Ninja Theory's multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. (The images were miniature in size, presumably to avoid highlighting some of the wonkiness AI is known for.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, Microsoft made the claim that Muse would "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future", and that the algorithm could be used to make older games compatible with "any device".
</p>

<p>
Reaction to Microsoft's announcement was swift, with social media awash with posts pointing out that, yes, Microsoft was absolutely jumping on the tech industry's AI buzzword bandwagon - but also the suggesting that Xbox was about to start using Muse to pump out AI slop. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, someone has done a better job than Microsoft itself of explaining what Muse is actually doing - and that person is AI researcher and game designer Dr Michael Cook.
</p>
<p>
For background, Cook is an expert on the subject of AI in games - he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-an-ai-win-a-game-jam">the guy who built an artificial intelligence to see if it could win a game jam</a> a full decade ago, whose work <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plastic-soul-one-mans-quest-to-build-an-ai-that-can-create-games">Eurogamer has covered on several occasions</a>. He's also a senior lecturer at King's College London, and has published and spoken extensively on the subject of AI.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-before-you-post/index.html">Cook lays out in an extended blog post on Muse</a>, the AI model is not generating gameplay or creating its own original ideas. 
</p>
<p>
In short, Muse was fed seven years of video footage of people playing a singular game - in this case, Bleeding Edge - to see if it could then generate further gameplay footage of it.
</p>
<p>
(If this all sounds familiar, it's similar to the process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-reaches-grim-ai-milestone-replicates-playable-version-of-doom-entirely-by-algorithm">Google used to generate footage of classic first-person shooter Doom</a> last year.)
</p>
<p>
So, what's the point of all this? Well, as Cook writes, it's so Microsoft researcher could ask Muse to predict what might come next if changes to a game were made.
</p>
<p>
"They made a tool that let game developers edit a game level using existing game concepts like adding in a jump pad to a place where there wasn't one before," Cook explains. 
</p>
<p>
"They then gave this new level to their model, and asked it to show what it thought the footage of a player playing from this new position would look like."
</p>
<p>
In other words, the idea is Muse could be used as a shortcut tool for predicting and visualising how gameplay might adapt to a particular input by a developer. And, crucially, that developer is still a human.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2025-02-20-123122.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Muse's AI-generated gameplay footage of Ninja Theory multiplayer game Bleeding Edge. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Microsoft's research paper on Muse says the AI model is required to understand persistency, consistency, and diversity in order to succeed. In other words, if a human input is provided, the AI needs to ensure the effects of that input remain, whatever else is going on, and that the effects remain similar while adapting to a range of player behaviours.
</p>
<p>
For example, say a human adds a jump pad to a game's level. The paper says Muse must predict gameplay footage to reflect this which also ensures the jump pad persists (no deleting it!), that it reacts the same each time (it should always make players jump), regardless of what else is happening (this should apply even if a different player activates it).
</p>
<p>
"The paper is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," Cook continued. "It's about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools."
</p>
<p>
Notably, there's nothing in the paper that discusses the implications of Muse being added to the development processes of teams with a strong aversion to using AI, Cook notes. 
</p>
<p>
That said, in Xbox's blog post on Muse yesterday, Microsoft gaming AI exec Fatima Kardar stated that the company had simply "empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI" - suggesting there was no specific mandate from Microsoft to use AI, for now.
</p>
<p>
But even with Muse being just used for a limited purpose, Cook has further questions around whether it will ever be fully viable.
</p>
<p>
"This is not a practical process," Cook writes. "It's impressive that it can do this using visual information because things like lighting, camera angles, user interface and so on are a lot for an AI model to handle. 
</p>
<p>
"But ultimately, even with all of this data, all the time spent annotating datasets, and so on, it was still only just about able to generate footage predicting player behaviour."
</p>
<p>
Such a system currently lacks any practical use, is enormously expensive, and requires any developer already have a vast vault of gameplay footage lying around for Muse to ingest in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"The research team behind this probably believe it will get more efficient over time, which might make it more affordable or tractable for small developers," Cook continues. "However, it still raises the question of how we get video footage of people playing our game in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"If you've been in development for a couple of months then you won't have enough footage, and even if we make the systems able to run on less input data there must be a minimum level required to understand the full game logic. So I think there is a question here not just of whether it makes sense as a tool now, but whether it can ever make sense."
</p>
<p>
Lastly, on game preservation.
</p>
<p>
"You could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run," Xbox chief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=225s&amp;ab_channel=Xbox">Phil Spencer said yesterday in a video on Muse</a>. "I feel that's really exciting."
</p>
<p>
Bluntly, Cook calls Spencer's comments "idiotic".
</p>
<p>
"I mean, in a sense anything is a preservation tool," Cook writes. "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort."
</p>
<p>
Despite a decade of AI growth, Cook says, there's no method yet to measure what exactly an AI model has captured and what it has not. Muse is able to provide grainy gifs of one fairly simple video game based on seven years of footage, but it is not a solution for holding everything about a game or every possible outcome of what players could do.
</p>
<p>
"This is absolutely not a solution for game preservation," Cook concludes, citing a <a href="https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/reports/37f6e434-73cf-43f5-8d7e-7ab37a6de832">report by gaming archeologist Florence Smith Nicholls about the archiving of digital games</a>. "What does it mean to preserve a gameplay experience? Even if this model was a perfect replication of the original executable software, this is not the be-all and end-all of game preservation. A generative model of what game footage maybe looked like once might be a nice curio on the side of a real preservation process, but it is always going to be inferior to other ways we approach the problem."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Strauss Zelnick weighed in with his opinion of AI</a>, saying that "artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has now surpassed 32 million players a year after release, though lawsuits filed by Nintendo remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Developer Pocketpair shared the news on social media, with those player numbers across Steam, Xbox and PS5.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky year Pocketpair and its monster-catching game, which first caught the attention of players for its Pokémon-with-guns aesthetic.</p>
<p>Upon release, the game hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-has-clocked-up-2m-players-in-just-24-hours">two million players in just 24 hours</a> and its all-time concurrent player peak on Steam remains just over two million players. Two weeks later, the game had surpassed 19 million players across PC and Xbox Series X/S, with Microsoft touting it as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-19m-players-sees-biggest-third-party-game-pass-launch-ever">biggest third-party launch in Game Pass history</a>.</p>
<p>The launch was soured, though, by comparisons with the Pokémon series, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">fans calling the Pal designs "lazy"</a> due to their similarities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">game eventually arrived on Sony's PS5 in September</a>, to further expand the playerbase. And that will increase further once a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-headed-to-mobile-courtesy-of-kraftons-pubg-studios">mobile release arrives, developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios</a>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo dropped a major bombshell in September when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">statement back in January</a> it would "investigate and take appropriate measures".</p>

<p>In November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">Pocketpair provided further details on the lawsuit</a>, revealing it related to three patents filed by Nintendo between February and July of 2024, which relate back to a pre-existing parent patent from December 2021. These patents cover gameplay mechanics like capturing digital creatures and riding them.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">Pocketpair ditched its Pokéball-style summoning mechanic</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, Nintendo has filed a number of patent applications in the US, as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/">GamesFray</a>. These appear to relate to similar patents filed in Japan. However, at present there is no suggestion Nintendo is bringing US litigation against Pocketpair - for now, the lawsuit remains in Japan.</p>
<p>Still, development on Palworld is ongoing, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Pocketpair is adding an "ending scenario"</a> as part of its second year roadmap, as well as co-op crossplay. It won't be the end of Palworld, though, as community manager John "Bucky" Buckley confirmed to Eurogamer this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">ending has been "mapped out for quite some time"</a>.</p>
<p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky told Eurogamer, discussing the past year. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Relic Entertainment has revealed their upcoming turn-based strategy game Earth vs Mars, an original IP that looks like a blend of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and classic Martian war romps from Hollywood like Mars Attacks! The game is expected to release for PC in summer 2025, and could be ported to consoles after that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth vs Mars - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dh0Jabqmb90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As mankind sets foot on Mars for the first time, the locals take that very, very personally, hijacking the airwaves to declare war on Earth. You’ll have to lead Earth’s military to fight back an overwhelming Martian invasion, battling against flying saucers, grav-tanks and the alien’s elite warriors with a blend of conventional military units and experimental hybrid supersoldiers courtesy of the Splice-O-Tron.</p>
<p>And we really mean experimental, as you mix pretty much any of Earth’s native species together: “Rain acid from the skies with the fast-moving cheetah-fly. Charge through enemy lines with devastating human-rhino hybrids. Or strike from the forests with your deadly squirrel-cow infantry.”</p>
<p>The game will feature a 30 mission single-player narrative campaign with hand-crafted levels, as well as online multiplayer, and AI vs mode, and map editor.</p>

<p>This is the first game in the new Relic Labs initiative from Relic Entertainment, who are looking to find their feet after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">going independent from Sega in early 2024</a> – this followed the underperformance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3/">Company of Heroes 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">significant layoffs across Sega</a>. Relic Labs games look to break away from the studio’s traditional stomping ground of real time strategy to explore new sub-genres and release more games more frequently.</p>
<p>The company will still, of course, continue to develop RTS games as their main output, and they have such a rich history that includes everything from Homeworld, Dawn of War, Company of Heroes and work for hire jobs, like Age of Empires IV.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nested-lands-preview-plague-centered-survival-builder.1114188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nested-lands-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="32d72e61-e11f-40d6-aadb-371cca8a505e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/nested-lands" rel="nofollow"><em>Nested Lands</em></a>&nbsp;is a new title from 1M Bits Horde that's heading to open alpha. Nested Lands is set during the medieval ages while a plague spreads across the world. As a survival game enthusiast, I was excited to try it out, especially with the focus on the plague adding a new challenge I've never had to face. After diving in, I can safely say that I'm going to be watching&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;as it continues to develop and is one fans of the genre should keep an eye on.</p>

<p><em>Nested Lands</em> gameplay features a melding of village management and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival</a> genres set in the aftermath of the Death Plague, though you can still contract the disease if you're not careful. You crash land on the small island of&nbsp;Norovellir and are aided by the only survivor of a small village. Your goal, the one your parents dreamed of, is to establish a thriving village in your homeland. Bandits are rife in the area, as are Plague Sites, making the safety and longevity of a village questionable.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=VK4arLB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=garXjFcP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully, there are many wanderers to be found on the island that are willing to work in exchange for a place to live, food, and water. One house can hold a single villager, and they can be assigned to specific tasks or crafting stations. This is where my biggest issue with&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;currently lies. The autonomy, which is being tested in the next alpha phase, is quite limited. While you can make a villager a blacksmith, they won't make ingots on their own. They will make nails once there are ingots, but won't make armor for you, even if all the materials are available. There's no way to ask them to craft specific items, so they often end up idle due to lack of materials, or only craft one type of item endlessly. Compared with titles like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b2075a3-87f2-4c12-a3d9-5541d2d6d84b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-villager-guide-how-to-grow-your-population" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a>, the villagers need some work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I enjoyed exploring the island and discovering pieces of history. The first of these comes at the beginning of the alpha when you're shown the cemetery. There's an odd tree growing there, with some sort of skull placed in front of it, almost ceremoniously. Some other locations I discovered while exploring were deep mines and plague sites that needed to be cleared out.&nbsp;Most contain letters pertaining to the general story, or personal notes that were left behind.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=sWhTVp0U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=5z9wzwXk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being an alpha test, the little tidbits of lore littered around the island give credence to the bigger story the team is developing. That's the part I'm most excited to watch get fleshed out. Who are the people that previously inhabited the area and what is their connection to the unusual trees you can stumble upon? What other secrets are hidden across the rest of&nbsp;Norovellir?</p>

<p>The available content is a little sparse, with only one residential house and under 10 crafting, wellness, and defense structures able to be built. However, you can build your village to its limits, adding as many of these buildings as you want. The alpha doesn't necessarily end when you reach the conclusion of the main questline. You can continue to explore, kill bandits, and avoid the plague for as long as you want.</p>

<p>More structures are going to be added in later stages of game development, as noted at the beginning of the game when you first load in. Specifically, a cookhouse is mentioned by one of the characters, though it's not shown as something you can construct. Official screenshots also show a medical building, different than the one you can build in game, so we can expect that to come in the future, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=AL6Xq628 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=2ylMUyXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the village management aspects of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>, it has basic survival mechanics like needing to eat, drink water, stay warm, and sleep regularly. Additionally, you need to keep clean to help stave off the plague. Characters, including yours, will remark when you smell bad, even stating something smells like it's rotting. Swimming in any body of water or using the bathhouse are easy ways to remain bacteria free. This reduces the chance of you getting sick or your villagers spreading disease around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best thing about the experience is knowing that <i>Nested Lands</i>&nbsp;feedback is getting looked at, especially on how to improve crafting and skills. You can directly impact how the game advances, which skills need tweaking and what ones are good as is. The open alpha is specifically looking at autonomy of villagers and how expansive villages can become, so all feedback on how those work will be extremely important for this test. I know I already sent in my opinion on the village management aspect of the title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alpha phase of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;has intrigued me enough to keep an eye on its development and want to continue my journey in&nbsp;Norovellir when additions are introduced to the game. It has staple survival mechanics along with village building and management. The inclusion of the plague and specific actions necessary to keep it at bay add a unique twist without over complicating things. How does this plague further hinder your chances of survival as your village grows is something I can't wait to experience. I'm excited to see where 1M Bits Horde takes&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands&nbsp;</em>in the future.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Answering GDC's 2023 survey, 78% of respondents said they considered the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/91-of-game-developer-survey-respondents-say-abuse-from-players-is-a-problem/">harassment and toxicity </a>developers receive from the public to be a serious issue. A simple sentiment is often the most effective, and the title of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> veteran Mark Darrah's <a href="https://youtu.be/0mkVfdbVAZE">latest video</a> cuts right to the heart of it: "Your $70 doesn't buy you cruelty."</p>
<p>You don't have to like a game, and you don't have stay quiet if you have complaints, says Darrah. You're entitled to be angry, and you're entitled to express that anger. "If you are mad at that Ubisoft game, be mad at Ubisoft," he says. "Express your anger to Ubisoft or the studio that made the game. But you cross a line when you start being cruel about it." (Thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mass-effect/bioware-veteran-calls-out-the-cruelty-of-fans-celebrating-layoffs-you-are-crossing-a-line-and-youre-probably-attacking-the-wrong-person-anyway/">PC Gamer </a>and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-and-anthem-producer-says-stop-harassing-developers-because-you-dont-know-the-circumstances-that-resulted-in-the-thing-that-youre-mad-at/">GamesRadar</a>)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"When you celebrate layoffs at a studio because the game that you don't like didn't do that well, you're crossing a line into being cruel, and fundamentally, you should have more grace for other human beings," Darrah says. "But if you're not buying that, let's go on to point two: you don't know what caused the results you don't like."</p>
<p>Mark Darrah! Are you suggesting to the internet that booting up a game doesn't instantly bestow you with a flawless grasp of development's every nuance like <a href="https://youtu.be/6vMO3XmNXe4">Neo learning Kung Fu</a>? I'd call it a dangerous play, but since you've already suggested commenters try a little basic empathy, I can only assume your tolerance for having bile slung at you is ironclad.</p>
<p>He gives an example of the sort of circumstances that might lead to issues. "Say you don't like the line delivery on a piece of dialogue. Is that the fault of the voice actor? It might be, but it could be a lot of other things". It might be the fault of the person directing them, he says. Maybe the writer gave specific stage directions, or the recording equipment went down and they were stuck with an imperfect take. Or maybe the writer themselves was under pressure from crunch.</p>
<p>"Maybe the direction of the game changed radically three months ago, and they had to rewrite this entire character in just three months," Darrah continues, which might well be an example plucked from experience. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which Darrah consulted on and has attracted a wave of the sort of ire he's calling out here, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">began life as a live service game</a>.</p>
<p>He gives several other examples of the sort of circumstances that can lead to perceived or real issues with quality, but the message is both clear and rings true: game development is complicated, and problems can occur at every level and cause ripple effects. It's also true that more public facing professionals often suffer the worst harassment, and for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">issues that are largely beyond their control</a>. None of which means that players should simply shut up about games that don't meet their hopes, but there's a line between proportionate feedback aimed at the company as a whole and just shitting on random designers over social media: especially when you're celebrating job losses.</p>
<p>"Express your opinion to the company that made your game. Tell them what you like, tell them what you don't like. Be specific. It will help you get games that are more like what you want. But when you are personally attacking individual devs, you are crossing a line, and you're probably attacking the wrong person anyway."</p>
<p>I'm concerned here that Darrah's words will not so much fall on deaf ears as ears deliberately chopped off by their owners. Call me cynical, but I don't think the sort of person who goes online to harass developers, writers, or actors is just one realisation away from stopping - whether that realisation is about the material or hierarchical realities of development, or simply the emotional toll the avalanche of abuse can take on their targets.</p>
<p>Still, if anything is likely to engender some empathy, developers speaking candidly about the realities of their work would be it, so hats off to Mark Darrah for speaking about this publicly. Just don't read the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NetEase revealed today that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players since its release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Daniel Ahmad on <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1892494212127502565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), NetEase released its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results today, revealing a new milestone for its hero shooter. Marvel Rivals reached 10 million players within the first 72 hours, 20 million within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two weeks</a>, and has amassed 40 million within three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that their Season 1 update, which arrived in January 2025, provided them with a “surge” that helped Marvel Rivals cross the 40 million mark and become one of Steam’s top sellers and most-played games globally. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 </a>brought a host of new balancing changes to the game along with fresh content such as Fantastic 4 characters, new maps and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, NetEase’s Where Winds Meet has reached 15 million players across PC and mobile, and their Justice mobile game has topped iOS download charts for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial results arrived right after an entire Marvel Rivals team in the United States was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly laid off</a>. The developers revealed later that this decision was made to “adjust the Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game.” You can check out the complete statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

Something about the way the body must contort to successfully crank a ball down the fairway just doesn't compute in my mind. But like few other games can, PGA Tour 2K25 takes everything I visualize myself doing in real life and executes it virtually, thanks to its in-depth simulation gameplay that lets my thumbs and brain do what my actual body simply refuses to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, I went into PGA Tour 2K25 a bit hesitant. While 2K23 wasn’t the worst golf game I’ve ever played, it lacked any shine in its personality or gameplay, which came as a surprise considering HB Studios has been dutifully working on successful golf sims like The Golf Club for well over a decade. Couple this with the fact that, unlike most sports games, PGA Tour 2K took two full years to put out a new iteration, and it was safe to say my expectations were in check.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To my surprise and relief, that extra time paid off: it didn’t take long for PGA Tour 2K25 to impress me with its improvements, especially in terms of appearance. While it still can’t quite match EA Sports’ rival PGA Tour game head to head in their respective visual recreations of golf, the difference is nowhere near as stark as it had been. Player models look much closer to their real-life counterparts, courses are more detailed, and animations are crisper. I found myself pausing while playing multiple times to take in the water crashing against the rocks or comparing the cut of the fairway, fringe, and rough areas for each course. The putting and driving animations are also fluid, no longer stopping abruptly after contact or feeling too weighty. Performance is smoothed out as well, and the only time I ever ran into issues with dropped frames on my PlayStation 5 was due to internet connectivity issues. Even the single-player Career Mode is always online, so there were a few instances where my shot would stutter and even a couple of times where my round didn't save.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found myself pausing while playing multiple times to take in the sights.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest gripe with the look and feel of PGA Tour 2K25 is the low-energy commentary team of Luke Elvy and Rich Beem. While they are both very knowledgeable, describing approaches and conditions beautifully, their lines could not be more flatly delivered. I know golf isn’t the most exciting sport, but there is no need to sound like a robot when discussing it.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They also seem to have a vendetta against me. If I do any worse than getting on the green in two or birdie putting, Rich Beem will berate me like Bob Barker going at Happy Gilmore—the price is wrong, Richie! At least thanks to my experience dealing with FIFA commentary for years, tuning them out wasn't very difficult. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that, it’s pretty much all good news. For example, it’s clear that HB Studios prioritized features that the community has been begging for. The most notable additions revolve around approaches, with the ability to change tee position and choose your hazard drop spot. It might seem like a small detail, but not being able to adjust position after a water hazard or move the ball at the tee for a better angle made for some of my most frustrating shots in PGA Tour 2K23. I love the amount of control that 2K25 gives me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change is that MyPlayer development has become an RPG system that allows you to unlock specific shots as you go, making your growth in the MyCareer campaign customizable to your specific strengths. Skills in the six trees vary from advanced shot types like the Stinger, which is ideal for dealing with high-wind situations, to proficiency boosts, which help buff each shot. I chose to build a Powerhouse archetype who focuses on driving down the fairway, getting my feet wet against other newbies in the Q-School. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was here that I got comfortable with the new EvoSwing mechanics. The new-and-improved golf swing technique focuses on proper posture, torque, and arc size, and after each swing it even breaks down how good your contact, rhythm, transition, and swing path are so you have detailed information on how to improve. You can even customize how it controls by choosing the classic Swing Stick or the 3-Click Swing, depending on your skill level. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a veteran golf (gamer) I love 3-Click Swing for the control it gives you over your shot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swing Stick simply requires you to pull the right stick back and release to swing, which is easy to get the hang of but it still has to be lined up well to get a good shot. The 3-Click Swing is certainly harder to master, since you have to press, hold, and release before clicking to push or pull the shot and finally click again to hook or slice, but it is something I love as a veteran golf (game) for the control it gives you over your shot. After using it to blow my competition out of the water, shooting 30 under par across four days, I moved on to the PGA Tour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the real deal, the goal here is to compete for points in tournaments, finishing in the Top 70 to earn a spot competing for the FedExCup. But instead of thrusting you into each event blindly, PGA Tour 2K25 features training and scouting scenarios before each event as a way to earn stat buffs and get the lay of the land. Training scenarios are bite-sized minigames, such as target challenges or competing to land on the green quickest or to sink the most long putts. Completing these gives your character a temporary boost in specific attributes, which is applied to the coming tournament. At first, I shrugged these off as ways to pad playtime, but once I played on harder difficulties I realized how what seemed like a minor buff to my drive power could mean the difference between hitting the fair way instead of a bunker. Practice Rounds also give you an edge for the coming tournament in exactly the way you’d expect: being able to play and feel out the specific run and shape of every course just before competing there is a real difference-maker. It is so satisfying to strategize for a course just like the pros would. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PGA Tour 2K25 Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every new feature in MyCareer lands on the fairway, though – especially the new personality and popularity mechanics. We’ve seen all this before in other games like Madden and EA Sports FC: Your pro spends time off the course gaining influence with fans, developing a following, and forming a personality based on the answers they choose in conversations and interviews. While this is a well-meaning effort to give MyCareer a bit more flair and make you feel like the belle of the ball, the system feels just as pointless as it does in other games. All conversations are done through text and don't have an effect on the actual gameplay, so it feels unpolished and isn’t a good use of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual way to get sponsorships and unlock questlines for XP is simply by doing well at playing golf. This was pretty easy to do at first because the default settings PGA Tour 2K25 feel like child's play: I was easily winning each tournament, destroying the likes of Viktor Hovland by -13 strokes a round. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dynamic option is my favorite addition to MyCareer since 2K23.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, I decided to experiment with the customizable sliders, which let you tune everything from CPU difficulty to green conditions to weather. The difficulty took the most time to experiment with, as it was hard to find the right percentages to match my own skills, and seemed uneven. In some games, one golfer would score 10 under the second-closest AI rival. However, once I adjusted weather and course conditions to random the playing field started to feel much more level, and scores were closer. Either everyone benefited from the smooth greens and shining sun, or everyone suffered the whipping winds and slick surfaces where the ball glides way too fast across them.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynamic option, though, is my favorite addition to MyCareer since 2K23: With this, you can choose the number of holes you want to play within a course, and which specific ones, and any skipped holes will be simulated. I don't mind playing a full 18 most of the time, but having the option to shorten the time commitment for some rounds by simming dynamically is a nice touch. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Andrew's Best Golf Games</h3><p>These are the best golf games around!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Microtransactions are, unfortunately, still present in PGA Tour 2K25, but mercifully they are mostly cosmetic-based. Yes, you can dump real money into making your player a superstar stat-wise and decked out with flashy clothes right off the bat, but you'll also earn upgrade points and different outfits at a decent clip by completing tournaments, so they aren't entirely necessary and are less objectionable than what 2K has been doing in its casino-like approach to NBA 2K in recent years. So playing online with others is still enjoyable, since this isn’t a sport where you’re being dunked on by someone who can run faster and jump higher because they paid extra.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same seven online modes from 2K23 return, including my favorite: four-ball. I loved competing against my partner and the other team, as it simply felt more competitive, fast-paced, and interactive than going against AI. For my money, this mode is the next best thing to being out on the course with your buddies competing in real life. Ranked and Casual games also let you choose between Swing Stick and 3-Click lobbies and select which gameplay features and aides you want off and on to make sure everybody’s on the same page. It’s also notable that Societies mode now offers crossplay features, letting you and your friends schedule asynchronous events regardless of platform differences. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/616296/twitch-storage-cap-highlights-uploads-speedrunning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Twitch is planning to cull some of the content archived by streamers to save on storage costs. On Wednesday, <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand?language=en_US#storage">the streaming platform announced</a> that it will introduce a 100-hour storage cap for highlights and uploads starting on April 19th, warning that users will have their content automatically deleted until it falls below the limit.</p><p>Twitch says it’s doing this because “Highlights haven’t been very effective in driving discovery or engagement,” and it isn’t worth the cost of storing thousands of hours of such content. Twitch is owned by Amazon, a market-leading cloud storage provider — a detail that hasn’t gone unnoticed by streamers criticizing the decision.</p><p>The update only applies to highlights — specific snippets edited from recordings of live broadcasts (VODs) using the Highlighter tool to showcase the streamer’s best moments — and uploaded footage created using third-party services. Other kinds of on-demand content, including Clips and VODs (the latter of which are already automatically deleted) won’t be impacted by the new storage limit.</p><p>Twitch users who have already exceeded the cap can download highlights and uploads before the restrictions take effect, after which content will be deleted starting with highlights with the least views. To make it easier to decide which videos to keep, Twitch is rolling out a new storage tracker on the Video Producer page and the ability to filter highlights and uploads by length, view count, and creation date. It won’t be possible to go over 100 hours of highlights and uploads once all users have been brought below the limit.</p><p>“Introducing this 100-hour storage limit, which impacts less than 0.5 percent of active channels on Twitch and accounts for less than 0.1 percent of hours watched, helps us manage resources more efficiently, maintain support of highlights and uploads, and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed,” Twitch said.</p><p>The automatic deletions and 100-hour cap will notably impact Twitch’s speedrunning community, whose history is largely archived through highlights. While highlights and uploads can be exported and uploaded to other platforms, the process is laborious and may interfere with how speedrunning records have been documented on the web. </p><p>“Not just world records, but most every run submitted that was on Twitch is stored as a highlight on speedrun.com. That includes users who no longer run, no longer stream, no longer have an online presence, or may even not be alive anymore,” <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/928429-channel-page/suggestions/49496519-do-not-implement-100-hour-limit-for-highlights-and#:~:text=Probably%20the%20most,for%20speedrun%20history.">one Twitch forum user noted</a>. “Crippling the highlights feature is going to be an unmitigated disaster for speedrun history.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has finally blessed us with Killing Floor 3 and a release date nine years after KF2. The second title delighted in the decimation and deliberate dissection of Zeds. Now, they’re back, and we’re back too to deliver unto them a three-course meal of bravado, bullets, and brain splatters.</p>



<p>Killing Floor has always been no-nonsense in what it’s trying to accomplish. Waves of Zombies (Zeds) trying to kill you, and us trying to repel their unsubtle advances with extreme violence and explosions. I spent many hours in Killing Floor 2 eliminating Zeds, earning cash, upgrading my gear, and having a tense showdown with the final boss.</p>



<p>It would appear <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. So let’s dive into the latest entry in the series and check out its launch date, platforms, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-killing-floor-3-come-out">When Does Killing Floor 3 Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that! Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 25 is Killing Floor 3’s scheduled release date—unless something changes at the last minute.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, March 2025 is a busy month. But, if there’s one thing we need, it’s a ferocious first-person shooter in the mix. <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> looks to distance itself from the pack with an affordable entry point and unique selling attributes.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-platforms">Killing Floor 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the listed platforms for Killing Floor 3.</strong></p>



<p>I find most games releasing in 2025 are doing the same thing: Releasing on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It’s rare to see old-gen ports, and even rarer for a third-party title to get Nintendo Switch attention. The eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could change things of course, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-editions-amp-price">Killing Floor 3 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Killing Floor 3 has three different editions to consider: Standard Edition ($39.99/£34.99), Deluxe Edition ($59.99/£51.99), and Elite Nightfall Edition ($79.99/£69.99).</strong></p>



<p>There’s no ultra-deluxe-premium edition for Killing Floor 3. But there are physical copies if you want to go that route—although not all editions are available in physical form.</p>



<p>Check out each edition and its price here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Killing Floor 3 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$39.99 or £34.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £51.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite Nightfall Edition</td><td data-align="center">$79.99 or £69.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<hr>



<p>March 2025 is shaping up to be a chaotic month for video game releases. Alongside Killing Floor 3, brace yourselves for the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <p>Marvel Rivals has amassed over 40 million players since its launch, but Chinese publisher NetEase has denied abandoning western studios after it laid off a number of developers from the game's US development team.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, the company also boasted the free-to-play hero shooter topped Steam's global sellers chart after launch and had over 10 million registered users within 72 hours.</p>
<p>However, earlier this week NetEase laid off an unspecified number of employees from Marvel Rivals' US development team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">game director Thaddeus Sasser breaking the news first</a>. "This is such a weird industry," he wrote. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games... and were just laid off!"</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">Netease stated afterwards</a> the layoffs were a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency". However, a new report from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">VentureBeat</a> suggests there's more to come.</p>
<p>Sources interviewed by VentureBeat said the company is losing its will to make games outside of China, in part due to the high cost of US developers. The success of games like Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also prove the AAA capabilities of China's own development studios.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that recent layoffs have coincidentally occurred alongside the trade war between the US and China, which could have further repercussions in the global games industry.</p>
<p>NetEase has denied such allegations.</p>
<p>"As far as overseas business efforts are concerned, NetEase has not wavered in its global expansion plans," reads a statement from the company to VentureBeat.</p>
<p>"Our 'two-pronged' approach, proposed in 2022 (combining self-research and investments to explore overseas markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results. For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024. These projects demonstrate NetEase's ability, along with our talented development teams, to produce high-quality games loved by players worldwide. For 2025, we have an extensive pipeline of titles in development, featuring a variety of genres, including FragPunk, Ananta and more."</p>
<p>NetEase did, however, acknowledge a "scaling down" of studios - something that has led to shutdowns and layoffs at an array of studios including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters' Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook's Jar of Sparks</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg's Liquid Swords</a>.</p>
<p>"As part of our investment strategy, we started scaling down two of our studios at the end of 2024," it said. "This decision was based purely on business evaluations and was not influenced by other factors. And this represents only a small portion of our overseas studio portfolio. Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects."</p>
<p>It continued: "We are very open and aim to leverage our company's strengths and accumulated expertise to support all developers. In order to achieve this vision, we have implemented an evaluation process, which applies equally to all NetEase studios globally – both domestic and overseas."</p>
<p>As far as the trade war is concerned, NetEase responded: "Regarding the tariff trade war, yes of course we are mindful of any developments in international trade. However, our decisions have been based solely on business evaluations and not influenced by other factors. We highly respect our gaming community in the US and their love and enthusiasm for our games is valued and appreciated."</p>
<p>Could other Chinese games companies pull out of the US? All eyes are on Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, the biggest games company in the world, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">US labelled as a military company</a> last month. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent threatened "legal proceedings"</a> in retaliation.</p>
<p>"While geopolitical concerns and cost pressures after two challenging years for the global video game industry are driving Chinese game companies to re-evaluate their US operations, this does not signal a withdrawal from operating and investing in studios overseas," gaming analyst firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/">Niko Partners wrote</a> yesterday. "It instead reflects a more selective and strategic approach to overseas investments, prioritizing projects with clear market potential - a business and fiscally driven strategy."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in its financial report, NetEase stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">wuxia action game Where Winds Meet</a> surpassed 3m downloads within four days of its PC launch in China - combined with the later mobile release, the game had 15 million players within two weeks. A release outside of China is expected this year.</p>
<p>"We boldly pushed the boundaries of innovation once again in 2024, delivering groundbreaking gaming experiences that captivated players worldwide," said CEO William Ding. "Our new hit titles not only redefined gameplay but also set new industry benchmarks, while our legacy franchises gained fresh momentum through striking enhancements in design, storytelling and immersive content. As our diverse game portfolio expands across more genres and engages an ever-growing global audience, we remain dedicated to fostering creativity and collaborating with top talent and strategic partners to shape the next wave of gaming trends."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals season 1.5 launches tomorrow, adding The Thing and Human Torch among other additions detailed in the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250218/41548_1212474.html">patch notes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/theres-a-pokemon-day-pokemon-presents-stream-happening-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s Pokémon Day on 27th February, and to mark the annual celebration, The Pokémon Company will have a Pokémon Present video.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Presents video will go live at 2PM UK time – <span dir="auto">6:00AM PST / 10:00 PM SGT – on that date.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="February 27 is Pokémon Day!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8gkKHR512M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s as far as The Pokémon Company has gone in revealing what will be shown, but we can absolutely make some educated guesses.</p>
<p>Top billing will surely go to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-for-2025/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the next big console game in the series that was announced at Pokémon Day last year with a 2025 target. An offshoot to the main series, just like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> was, this game takes us to the high tech new city of Lumiose City, where the world is being reshaped as part of an “urban redevelopment plan” to accommodate people and Pokémon together. We’re keen to see some meaningful gameplay from this one, and perhaps get a release date?</p>

<p>Beyond that we can expect plenty of updates on mobile and live service games. That will surely include the perennial Pokémon Go, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/12/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-launches-december-17th/">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, Pokémon Masters EX, Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Cafe ReMix and the slumbersome Pokémon Sleep.</p>
<p>But will there be any surprises? We’re in a bit of a lull for the franchise as a whole, as Arceus and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> both launched in 2022, the latter having DLC expansions through 2023. We know that Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming this year, but they might see fit to tease the next mainline game for 2026, perhaps?</p>
<p>If they did do that, we could be sure that these games will be cross-gen at the least. There’s pretty much no chance of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2</a> exclusive game coming within the first couple years of that console’s life – Sword and Shield was over two years after the Switch launched, to have a large enough audience, so expect the next mainline Pokémon game to want to tap into the huge playerbase that might not yet have upgraded. Additionally, there surely won’t be any Switch 2 chatter before the console’s big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Nintendo Direct presentation on 2nd April</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two-now-has-a-release-date-in-the-us-and-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>On HBO and Sky, respectively</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've known that HBO's Last Of Us adaptation was getting a second season <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-getting-a-second-season">since 2023</a>, but now it has a release date. The first episode will air in the US on April 13th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Season two is set five years after the first series, and is due to partially cover the events of the second game, The Last Of Us: Part Two. That's "partially" because the show's creators have suggested it will take several seasons to tell that story in full.
</p>
<p>UK viewers will be able to begin season two the day after its US broadcast when the first episode is shown on Sky and streaming service NOW on Monday, April 14th.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us: Part Two</a> is also due to arrive on PC in lightly remastered form on April 3rd. It'll be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">via Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>The first season of HBO's adaptation was critically acclaimed, and became the first video game adaptation to be nominated for several awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">such as the Emmy's</a>. It stuck closely to the plot of the original game, with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>I loved showrunner Craig Mazin's previous prestige series Chernobyl, but I confess I have very little appetite to watch The Last Of Us. It's a grim tale, and while that's arguably offset by the satisfaction of the interactions in the game, I can't imagine passively watching it without becoming deeply depressed. This is not a criticism of the show, mind you, merely an admission that I'm a softhearted babyman. I'll be watching old-fashioned cosy crime show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26591110/">Elsbeth</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The live-action Street Fighter film now has a new director: Kitao Sakurai.</p>
<p>Capcom is "deeply involved with the adaptation" reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">still set to release on 20th March 2026</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American filmmaker most recently directed Netflix film Bad Trip starring comedian Eric André. Sakurai also wrote, directed and exec produced The Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Sakurai also isn't a stranger to video game adaptations, having directed several episodes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> TV show. He was also exec producer on the second season of Netflix show Beef, and directed several episodes of forthcoming Amazon series Butterfly.</p>
<p>Legendary will co-develop and co-produce the film alongside Capcom.</p>
<p>A previous incarnation of the film was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-street-fighter-movie-gets-the-directors-behind-horror-film-talk-to-me">set to be helmed by Australian twin filmmakers and YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou</a>, known for the horror film Talk to Me. Last June the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-loses-talk-to-me-filmmakers-1235924842/">pair left the project</a> with scheduling partly to blame.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film, though Capcom's involvement will hopefully ensure its authenticity. I'm sure we can expect the likes of Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li to feature.</p>
<p>Of course, it's by no means the first Street Fighter film adaptation, following the infamous 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter film will be up against its traditional rival, Mortal Kombat.</p>

		<p>Indie psychological horror hit Mouthwashing is coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch in 2025, developer Wrong Organ and publisher CR Channel have announced. The game will have both a digital and physical release.</p>
<p>Mouthwashing released in September last year for PC, the game immediately getting plenty of attention for its dark narrative, in which five crew members of The Pony Express deal with dwindling resources and extreme isolation, descending into madness that’s accentuated by the retro PSX visual style.</p>


<p>The game has just passed the 500,000 sales mark on PC, with the team writing that this “honestly feels more surreal than any bizzaro psychosis.” They continue, “Everyone, you truly are incredible and we’re extremely grateful to you for taking a part in this painful journey and on behalf of everyone here both at Wrong Organ and CR Channel we want to say thank you!”</p>
<p>The next port of call is the aforementioned console releases. They’ve teamed up with Fangamer for a run of the game in physical form, alongside a digital release on both platforms. You can <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/pages/mouthwashing-physical-edition">sign up to be notified</a> of the physical edition’s availability –&nbsp;it’s sure to be in high demand, like so many indie game physical prints.</p>

<p>The Fangamer partnership will go beyond just the physical game, with a bunch of Mouthwashing merch that will include apparel, plushies, vinyl and more.</p>

			<p>Today, in <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetEase's Q4 earnings report</a>, we learned that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players to date across all platforms. Here's the relevant tidbit:</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals topped Steam's global top sellers chart shortly after its launch on December 6, amassing over 10 million registered users within 72 hours and over 40 million to date. Its Season 1 update in January 2025 sparked another surge, claiming the No. 1 spots on Steam's top sellers and most-played charts worldwide.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game had surpassed 20 million players just eleven days after its launch. In the first month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to have earned more than $135 million. That didn't stop NetEase from essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing the Western support team</a>, though, much to the disappointment of fans. Of course, that doesn't mean the publisher is putting less effort into supporting this highly successful game - but the workforce will be based in China, where development is obviously cheaper.</p>
<p>Anyway, Marvel Rivals will be updated tomorrow to introduce the final two members of the Fantastic Four: Human Torch and The Thing. The former is a Duelist type of character, while the latter is, predictably, a Vanguard. The update also adds a new Convergence map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. There are several gameplay and online matchmaking tweaks, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extra 0.5 seconds of grace time will be added at the end of the overtime in all modes, optimizing situations where games may end abruptly (like when players cannot be detected due to certain hero abilities or when accidentally drift slightly outside the valid range).</li>
<li>In Quick Mode, matchmaking for substitutes will no longer occur when a quick match is about to end.</li>
<li>Optimization: Improved loading speed at the start of matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side, this Marvel Rivals update adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, on PC. We've tested this as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090 review</a>, since NVIDIA provided advanced access to the feature.</p>
<p>There's good news for AMD users, too. The developers have improved frame pacing while using FSR 3 Frame Generation, so you should get a smoother experience. Additionally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-anti-lag-2-game-integrated-tech-counter-strike-2-preview-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon Anti-Lag 2</a> is available now, reducing system latency. As a reminder, Anti-Lag 2 requires an AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series or newer GPU.</p>

<p>A new Lord of the Rings Game is coming—Tales of the Shire. It has a release date, and we know its available platforms. You can put the swords away and forget about cave trolls as Tales of the Shire is a different type of LOTR title.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 are quite stacked. So much so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-the-shire-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a> is going under the radar. This could be for two reasons: The reception to Gollum and Return to Moira and the attention being given to other releases. But Tales of the Shire is a new type of Lord of the Rings game likely appealing to a large demographic.</p>



<p>It’s a life sim where you get to experience the day-to-day life of a hobbit in the Shire. You don’t need to pack wellies for the Dead Marshes, and Isengard can stay where it is for now. Let’s find out the juicy details for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game has a March 25 release date.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It arrives during a busy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2025</a> with the likes of Killing Floor 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a> might be the one for you if you’re not into life sims instead of shooters, post-apocalyptic titles, and wrestling</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-platforms">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch are the peculiar choices of platform for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</strong></p>



<p>I say peculiar because seldom do you see a title release for the Switch, and not old-gen PS4 and Xbox One consoles. This is the reality of the situation, so if you do own any of these formats, you can celebrate and get ready for elevenses.</p>



<p>If you are on old-gen, don’t rule out future ports if the game succeeds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you picking this one up as a Lord of the Rings fan? Or because you enjoy life-sim games in the region of The Sims and Stardew Valley? Plus, can Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game break the recent jinx and deliver a solid LOTR title?</p>
