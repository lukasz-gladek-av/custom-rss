            <p>
If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don't currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 
</p>
<p>
Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That interface! There's an innocent 30 seconds initially when you think it's just badly designed. But then you realise that it is a creature of foul and labyrinthine purpose. Broadly, it consists of a Dwarf Fortressy grid-based world map, where you can shunt your city about and send mech squads on missions, with tabs for researching new components, fabricating them, and assembling them into conveniently coffin-sized Gundams you can then fill with pilots. There's a calendar which lets you advance to the next day. Reading those sentences back, it sounds practically transparent. Like XCOM but with extra robots, right? Wrong! Mech Engineer is nothing like XCOM. It is like tying your shoelaces with a pair of scissors. It is like doing jigsaw puzzles in a cesspit after the death of the sun.
</p>
<p>
When I mentioned Mech Engineer to Graham he said it reminded him of MicroProse's older interface 'em ups, in which the thrill arises from the quasi-analog, high-fidelity obfuscatoriness of the simulation itself. I subsequently went away and discovered that yes, MicroProse is Mech Engineer's publisher. I do not have the benefit of Graham's greatly advanced years and accompanying experience of recreational inconvenience, but to me Mech Engineer feels almost like a parody of MicroProse's games on par with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

<p>
The interface is a sour quagmire of analog dials, submarine-style viewports, wireframe graphs and incomprehensible LED readouts, laid out in violent contradiction of present day notions of "flow", with several ways of flipping between screens that compete for your attention constantly, on-screen buttons in place of keyboard controls, a habit of miniaturising the most important elements, and a relentless desire to overcomplicate every little interaction. Again, you might think it to be poorly made, but it's very obviously a labour of love. Each individual fitting has a just-so exactness, from the monochrome firing range simulator through the authentically papery bestiary and landscape illustrations, to the sheer range of alarm SFX and mechanical reports that blare from the guts of the beast as you tootle about pressing the wrong bits and getting your pilots slaughtered.  
</p>
<p>
The actual mech engineering is in-depth and seems engrossing. For instance: you have to construct, test and ignite a mech's reactor before slotting it into the chassis, which feels vaguely cathartic - like putting the cherry on a carefully optimised cake's worth of delicately thinned-out armour plating, optional energy shields, and chonky Gatling guns that can themselves be tweaked and whittled to satisfaction. Battle, meanwhile, is fairly hands-off and visually reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a>: you give your squad waypoints and fiddle with things like spacing while they shoot at Space Invaders in real-time on a scratchy radar display, until they run out of ammo or crumple under the stress. 
</p>
<p>
Your pilots have animated portraits, and my word, they are an unsightly bunch even before you feed them to the extra-terrestrials - not so much an army of Doomguys as a cluster of chatbot gargoyles gawping at you from the abyss. Again, there's a just-so feel to it all that hooks my curiosity even as I whinny in anguish, uninstall the demo in a frenzy, and race back to the library at midnight to download something gentler, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a>. Mech Engineer! How I loathe you, especially as I've just realised that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-putting-mech-engineer-on-trial-and-error">Sin wrote you up three years ago</a> - honestly, it sounds like the only thing that has really changed in the meantime is that you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428520/Mech_Engineer/">buy the full thing on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Hypercharge Unboxed by Digital Cybercherries Limited is out now on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have ever seen a reel or a TikTok of a game where a bunch of toys are causing chaos with weapons in the middle of a toy store, then you know about Hypercharge Unboxed. The 2020 multiplayer and offline shooter is now officially available through the Xbox store. The game is an indie project that has been developed by a team of 6 people and was first available only through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. Commendably, Hypercharge Unboxed has sold more than 40,000 copies within 4 days of its release on the Xbox Store, as per Jake Lucky on X (formerly Twitter).&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The viral game where you play as action figures in a toy store is officially out on Xbox, selling over 40,000 copies in it's first 4 days, a dream accomplished for the lead of this indie dev project <a href="https://t.co/KFjo6tkfBx">pic.twitter.com/KFjo6tkfBx</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1797666996135555270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Talking about the game, the story revolves around an ancient line of action figures that allows humans to retain their childhood memories with their toys through a magical power called Hypercore. In this first and third-person shooter, you get to play as action figures as you fight against hordes of weaponized toys and save the Hypercore from a villainous faction called Major Evil.&nbsp;</p>

The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hypercharge-unboxed/9ngk4zhkbc8x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Standard Edition</a> provides the base game at the price of $29.99.

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> is Ubisoft’s attempt at creating a <em>Call of Duty</em> killer, but the company has so much more locked away in its IP vault. That’s why it should be no surprise that a leaker has discovered mentions of maps themed around <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false"><em>CoD</em> is well-known for its weird and wacky crossovers these days, so it’s not a huge shock that <em>XDefiant</em> aims to follow that pattern too. It’s easier when you own a lot of IP as well, as Ubisoft does, so getting them into your game is much easier and doesn’t require negotiations with the rights owners. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">According to Rogue, an <em>XDefiant</em> dataminer, two <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maps should appear in the game at some point in the future, with the leaker posting a clip featuring sounds from the maps, while also stating that they had found a “good amount of things related to” the locations. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="710" data-injectable="true">It would definitely be interesting to see what those maps would look like, with all of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maps set well in the past. Whether we would see locations from history or maps based on the more modern-day story that is expected to feature in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Infinity</em>. Other leaks have suggested that a new faction called The Brotherhood could also be linked to the long-running series.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Of course, it’s worth remembering that these are leaks and rumors, and haven’t been confirmed by Ubisoft. Therefore, it’s worth taking all of this information with a pinch of salt until we get official word from the developers. Still, it’s hard not to let your imagination run wild at the thought. </p>

            <p>Swedish store and home of flatpack furniture Ikea is hiring 10 people from the UK and Ireland to assist with the running of a virtual store in Roblox.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ikea-hiring-roblox-players-run-virtual-in-game-store/">TheGamer</a>, this virtual store is part of a "Careers Done Different" campaign, which Ikea hopes will demonstrate possible career paths available within the company.</p>
<p>Successful candidates will be able to serve meatballs in the store's bistro, and help patrons choose furniture in the showroom. As for pay, Ikea is offering an hourly wage of £13.15/€14.80 for this obviously fully remote position.</p>

<p>To apply, those interested will need to answer a range of questions including the deeply insightful "How do you feel about being turned into pixels?". Applicants will also need to think about what they would do if the bistro ran out of pixelated hot dogs during their shift.</p>

            <p>
Legendary game designer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has said he doesn't know if the world will ever see No More Heroes or its star Travis Touchdown again, following the launch of 2021's climactic No More Heroes 3.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer ahead of his appearance at MomoCon 2024 last month, No More Heroes creator and director Suda acknowledged that the rights to the No More Heroes series remain with Japanese game publisher Marvelous rather than his own studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
"Honestly, not even I know that," Suda51 told Eurogamer, when asked if No More Heroes and Travis Touchdown would ever return. "Of course I'd love to see him again, but to be honest it's simply not my call to make."

<p>
No More Heroes 3 was designed as a game to cap off the series so far, with Marvelous otherwise focused on its own franchises, such as Rune Factory, Story of Seasons and Daemon X Machina.
</p>
<p>
Suda51, meanwhile, is currently busy building <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-hotel-barcelona-a-horror-themed-side-scroller-from-swery-and-suda51">Hotel Barcelona, a collaboration between his Grasshopper Manufacture studio and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro</a>, of Deadly Premonition fame. 
</p>
<p>
"A long time ago, before Covid, we did an event in Shibuya where Swery was a guest. We just kinda started talking about doing a collaboration of some sort," Suda51 said of how work on Hotel Barcelona began. "The idea came up, Swery liked it, and he basically brought it all the way to development, and well, now it's a thing.
</p>
<p>"Swery is acting as both director and producer and is doing most of the work; I just kinda started it up with him at beginning. But Swery is having a lot of fun making it, and I'm having a lot of fun giving input here and there, etc. I'm extremely happy to be involved as co-creator."</p>
<p>Fans of Grasshopper's earlier work at least have two other launches to look forward to: remasters of both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-now-a-remaster-not-a-remake-developer-says">Lollipop Chainsaw</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-the-damned-remaster-announced">Shadows of the Damned</a>.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth features some rather interesting out-of-bounds secrets that can only be experienced by taking advantage of a certain glitch.</p>
<p>As reported by @deltasyn on X/Twitter, the glitch showcased by M_Two on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRFqVpMLLIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, which involves the blue Chocobo, which can normally only be ridden in the Nibel Region, allows players to reach some normally impossible to reach locations, such as <a href="https://x.com/deltasyn/status/1797036281618202684">Midgar</a>, <a href="https://x.com/deltasyn/status/1797521060021334380">Fort Condor</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/deltasyn/status/1797798352790184378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Village of the Gi</a>. While the former two aren't particularly interesting, the latter is far more interesting, as it features some objects that could have some lore and story implications.</p>
<p>On a related note, a new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch went live earlier today. The 1.040 patch fixes a variety of bugs, including several unspecified display-related bugs, and improves overall game stability. Full patch notes can be found on the Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-updates-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">official website.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5. Learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight.</em></p>

<p>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus confirmed with a larger battery and screen, as the previous device received Fallout collaboration during Computex 2024.</p>



<p>MSI had a panel today at the Computex 2024 event, announcing a mid-gen refresh for their handheld console, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/msi-claw-us-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Claw</a>. As per <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Trends</a>, the device is getting an upgraded model called the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus. Interestingly, just like the recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-x-launch-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Ally X</a>, the new model will also feature an 80 Whr battery, a substantial upgrade over the previous model. The most exciting upgrade comes towards its processor, as it will be ditching the existing Meteor Lake chips for Intel’s upcoming Lunar Lake series of processors.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Date : June 4 – June 7 2024 <br>Time : 9:30 am – 5:30 pm <br>Venue : Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, Hall 1, 4F, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M0806?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#M0806</a><br>MSI sincerely invites you to dive into the AI Era of Computing and witness our groundbreaking hardware and software innovations at COMPUTEX 2024. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSIxComputex2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSIxComputex2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/7eEVz8JAJz">pic.twitter.com/7eEVz8JAJz</a></p>— MSI (@msitweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/msitweets/status/1796074292666339738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, the report also reveals that we will see an upgrade in the memory and storage of the Claw 8 AI Plus. The RAM will be upgraded to 32GB LPDDR5x, capable of reaching 8.5gbps. The upcoming device will now have upgradeable storage, featuring a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD. The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus will also sport a larger 8-inch screen with a similar resolution and refresh rate, 1080p at 120Hz. These are the only details disclosed about the device thus far. Additional information, such as pricing, availability, and other specifications, shall be available soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the original MSI Claw has received a new limited edition model in collaboration with Fallout. The theme will be inspired by the Vaults, Pip-Boys, and robots from the game, offering fans a chance to immerse themselves even more during their Fallout sessions.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-2-remake-open-world/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout 2, the second entry in the series, which has recently seen a surge in popularity thanks to the Amazon Prime Video TV show, is getting remade by a team of dedicated fans in the style of the third and fourth entries in the series.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-2-fan-made-remake-interview-project-arroyo/#project-arroyo-will-be-open-world">The Gamer</a>, Damion Daponte, a freelance video editor who leads the Project Arroyo development team of over 100 modders, revealed some details on the project. The project is attempting to remake the second entry in the series as an open-world role-playing game using Fallout 4's engine. As the original game wasn't big enough, the team will also expand the world and offer a condensed-down version of San Francisco to explore.</p>
<p>The Fallout 2 fan-made remake will also rework some of the mechanics of the original, such as random encounters, which are not needed in an open-world RPG, bring back the classic Pip-Boy, and feature some assets lifted from New Vegas, which provided a better look at the New California Republic. Fallout 4's Power Armor will also be back in the remake, as the developer feels the way it works in the game makes more sense compared to how it functions in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.</p>
<p>While a release date for the Fallout 2 Project Arroyo remake has yet to be announced, there's a good chance the fan-made remake will be released on Steam. <em>"It’s just a platform that everyone has,"</em> Daponte said, <em>"it’s easier to access, easier to update, easier to install - it’s more efficient. We would have to figure out all the specificities, making it so you have Fallout 2 and Fallout 4 and all of its DLC to make sure there are no legal issues. But we’re still looking into it.”</em></p>
<p>More information on the Fallout 2 fan-made remake can be found on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/xDcqEb3jgt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>. You can also check out a quick comparison between the original and Project Arroyo in the video below.</p>

<p>The original Fallout 2 is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/38410/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_2">GOG.</a></p>

This review campaign has caused Team Fortress 2’s recent reviews user rating to plummet to ‘mostly negative’, with pretty much all the comments complaining about bots.</p><p>“It's time Valve does something about the bots,” reads one review from a user with over 630 hours on Team Fortress 2. “The game has been overrun with people willing to doxx, DDOS, and SWAT anyone who takes action against the problem.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/tf2-1717495240265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Team Fortress 2 is one of the oldest supported video games on the market. Image credit: Valve.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“The current state of this game is borderline unplayable,” reads another review from a user with over 950 hours. “It is CRIMINAL that Valve has done nothing against this issue, and have continued to profit off of this game.”</p><p>“Valve, you've got a gem of a game here that has left a mark on the internet culture for longer than I can remember,” reads another review, this time from a user with over 700 hours of game time. “We're tired of bots running rampant across the casual matchmaking. We want you to step in, we don't want another update, we don't want any cosmetics, we want you to #FixTF2.”</p><p>Team Fortress 2 is one of the oldest actively supported video games on the market, and remains popular enough to place within the top 10 games on Steam based on concurrent player numbers. However, some players have said this active player count is misleading, with cheater bots filling servers instead. Idle bots, meanwhile, farm Team Fortress 2 for free item drops. Some believe Team Fortress 2 has tens of thousands of bots idling in private servers, contributing towards the impressive player count on Steam.</p><p>Frustrating the Team Fortress 2 player base further is the apparent silence from Valve over the issue. The company continues to support the game with events, the latest of which ends on June 30, tournaments, and bug fixes. In April, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-updates-team-fortress-2-to-64-bit-boosting-performance-of-the-17-year-old-fps">Valve updated Team Fortress 2 to finally add 64-bit support</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-preview-the-first-truly-social-racer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With a freshly announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-release-date-confirmed-for-september/">release date in September</a>, the long wait for a new Test Drive Unlimited is coming to an end. Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will invite players to visit Hong Kong Island for a unique driving and racing experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GUCrMPJgkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You see, Solar Crown is as much about the racing as it is the social aspects. Most racing games only give a cursory nod to your avatar’s customisation with a bundle of race suits to wear, but Solar Crown doesn’t just let you change how you look when in the cockpit and on the podium, it invites you to step out of the car at various times. There’s the lobby of the Solar Hotel – a fictional spire built into the real-world setting – and there’s both open and private areas to the hubs for the Streets and the Sharps, the two rival car racing gangs of the city. You’ll even walk around car dealerships, the workshop where you can upgrade your car, and more.</p>


<p>Starting by picking a Nissan 370Z as my starter car, the handling is fun and accessible by default. Of course, racing game experts will want to switch to having fewer assists, letting more of a car’s natural tendencies come through as you push it to the ragged edge in a race. KT Racing promise individualised handling and characteristics for all of the more than 100 cars that will be in the game at launch, and I look forward to more time with the game to see how they’ve pulled this off.</p>
<p>After picking that first car, though, players will have to be willing to embrace a tangibly slower pace to the progression. Where modern Forza Horizon games will fling so many cars at you to the point that they become almost meaningless, Solar Crown wants to make everything feel earned and desirable. Getting a new car should be exciting, it should be something that you want to drive and master, to upgrade to the max over time as you look to rise up the rankings and the leaderboards.</p>


<p>Through upgrades, parts changes, and driving presets, cars will be adaptable. Of course, you can soup things up to become a street racing demon with slicker tyres, engine upgrades and more, but there’s plenty of off-road areas to explore on Hong Kong Island, and you could make that street car happier on gravel and dirt paths. Alternatively, save up and buy a truck or SUV, which can handle the bumpy uneven terrain much more easily.</p>
<p>Of course, modern gaming sensibilities have shifted over the last 15 years, and so KT Racing has a tightrope to walk to make Solar Crown still feel rewarding to those used to more instantaneous gratification. While they want you to play for many, many hours to earn enough cash to buy a Pagani Zonda, for example, they won’t gate-keep the applicable hypercar races quite so hard, with a lower-priced option available to take part while you save up. And there will also be car-specific events, such as the race we encountered that demanded we first go and grab a cheap and cheerful 500 Abarth to take part.</p>
<p>While you might have to wait to take a car into competition or to show off to your friends that you’ve managed to buy it, that doesn’t mean you can’t try it out. At any time you can visit one of the various opulent car dealerships, each dedicated to a particular country or region, and test drive one of the cars they have there – it’s in the title, after all. This gives you a tight two-minute window to see what a car is all about, and see if it’s actually the car you want to save up for and buy.</p>

<p>One gaming trend that Solar Crown <em>is</em> following is the shift to always online shared spaces and seasons of live content. For one thing, each race you look to take part in is preceded by some matchmaking to try and combine AI with real racers, and there will be other players doing their own thing on the island as you roam, or in the social areas that you wander around with your avatar. Each season will have a competition for players to take part in, looking to rise up the ranks from bronze, silver and up through to the Solar Court, which grants access to a special featured car – an ultimate flex to demonstrate their racing prowess. The very best player will be crowned as the Solar King or Solar Queen – one per region and per platform.</p>
<p>KT Racing has been inviting a select few fans and community members to check out the game and give feedback over the past year, and that’s led to some tweaks and changes that will be ready for the game’s launch. A much-requested feature, you will now have a personal garage space that lets you view up to six of your cars, inspect them in private and get in physically before choosing to join the open world – the slightest disappointment is that you can’t drive out of the garage at this point. For this demo, it also felt like the game was just a little bit too restrained early on, forcing me to repeat races and hunt down speed traps to earn the experience needed to level up and unlock both car upgrades and a new set of races. Our demo wasn’t that of the full game, but getting the early game flow right is the high-wire act that KT Racing will have to get just right for the final release.</p>

<p>On the whole, I feel that Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is coming together rather well. There’s so many more individual touches that show the different attitude and tone that it has to other open-world racing games, which will make it a breath of fresh air compared to the competition. I can’t wait to revisit Hong Kong Island in just a few months time.</p>

            <p>
The Dungeons of Hinterberg team has announced a demo for its upcoming Austrian-based Zelda-like adventure.
</p>
<p>
This demo will allow players to explore dungeons - including one described as "gravity-defying" - visit the Glacier Overworld and meet new characters during a full in-game day cycle.
</p>
<p>
The game's first playable demo will go live later this week, on 8th June, over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/">Steam</a>, where you can also add it to your wishlist.

<p>
Dungeons of Hinterberg has caught the attention of many members of the Eurogamer team. After taking part in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-has-stolen-my-heart">hands-off demo at Summer Games Fest</a> last year, our Chris Tapsell already felt the game looked "brilliant". He then managed to actually go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">hands-on with it earlier this year at GDC</a>, and his praise remained. "This game plays like a dream vacation - it's a delight," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>
These feelings were echoed by our Donlan, who has also been hands on with Dungeons of Hinterberg already. In his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-about-a-holiday-which-is-why-everything-feels-so-important">Dungeons of Hinterberg is about a holiday - which is why everything feels so important</a>, he expressed his delight at the game's art style, puzzles and world.
</p>
<p>
"There are hubs and areas to explore dotted with fast travel, but while I love uncovering treasure chests and new dungeons, there's a pleasure found purely in the fiction of where you are," he wrote. "Yesterday I climbed a hill and found a little restaurant at the top. It meant far more to me than any RPG trinket would. I took lots of screenshots and felt like I was on holiday, like I was exploring a place that I wouldn't get to stay in long term, and so I had to make the most of it. Wonderful stuff."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/austrian-zelda-like-dungeons-of-hinterberg-gets-release-date">Dungeons of Hinterberg is set for full release next month</a>, on 18th July. It will be available across Xbox Series X/S and Steam, including a day one release on Game Pass.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-yakuza-tv-show-is-coming-out-on-amazon-prime-in-october.888921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-yakuza-tv-show-is-coming-out-on-amazon-prime-in-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Amazon will air a live-action TV series based on Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza</a> games in October this year, says the streaming service. Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series "showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/well-whaddya-know-therell-officially-be-a-season-two-of-amazons-very-popular-fallout-tv-show">Fallout series</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Exactly what the plot of the show will be remains to be seen. But it will follow "the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity," according to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/">Variety</a>. That sounds like our boy Kiryu for sure. </p>
<p>Work on the TV show was first announced <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/yakuza-movie-sega-video-game-1234781210/">back in 2020</a>. And word later came out about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/14lfd0z/ryoma_takeuchi_and_kento_kaku_to_play_kiryu_and/">actors and directors</a> involved. Hard-punching bastion of justice Kiryu Kazama will be played by Ryoma Takeuchi, for example, who played the protagonist in Kamen Rider Drive. I've not seen any Kamen Rider, so I'm not qualified to tell you if this actor is good at channelling the indignant stiffness of a deeply annoyed statue. But that is what is required of him.</p>
<p>The series is being directed by Take Masaharu and Takimoto Kengo, and the original writer of the first game's script, Masayoshi Yokoyama, is on board as an executive producer. He suggests he was reluctant at first but decided to get involved. “Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza‘s script," he said, "I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create.”</p>
<p>We are quite fond of the Yakuza series here in the treehouse. Ed was into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> when it came out earlier this year. "It's a wonderful, happy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spawn-point-the-best-jrpgs-for-total-beginners">JRPG</a> and it will never fail to brighten my day," he said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">his review</a>. "Thank goodness for Yakuza."</p>
<p>One of my favourite scenes in Yakuza is when Kiryu sees some chumps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl25uwGLATc">throwing rocks at a puppy</a>. The father figure of Tokyo catches a rock in mid-air, inches from the dog's face. Then proceeds to destroy the goons in the only way he knows how. If the TV show adapts this one scene, I will be satisfied.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-modded-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crash-team-racing-%E2%80%9Cmodded%E2%80%9D-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility.888918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-modded-version-now-supports-online-multiplayer-mode-and-pc-compatibility/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Well, a modding team has done something intriguing to witness as they integrate multiplayer and PC compatibility into the original Crash Team Racing.</p>
<p>It's surprising what the modding community can do for titles, especially when it comes to reviving them and adding new features. The latest project by a modding team focuses on bringing an online mode into the game. In a demo of the title, the players in the actual game were connected through a worldwide network, with each player in a completely different country. Surprisingly, there weren't any sort of latency issues, and the game ran perfectly.</p>
<p><iframe title="OnlineCTR - The PS1 Crash Team Racing Online Experience (Launch Trailer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxhz0EMHlCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apart from the online play mode, the modded Crash Team Racing also supports "unofficial" compatibility with the PC platform, and the modding team utilizes DuckStation, the PS1 emulator, to do so. Moreover, the title runs at a stable 60 FPS, ensuring smooth gameplay despite being a "tuned" version of a game that was released almost two decades ago. In terms of the experience itself, the modded title allows you to pair up with up to 8 players with multiple tracks and characters similar to the original game.</p>
<p>Well, if you are interested in checking out "Online Crash Team Racing," you can visit the dedicated website <a href="https://www.online-ctr.com/">here</a>. In&nbsp;order to play it on PC, you'll need to have the DuckStation emulator installed as well. Playing the title is a nostalgic experience, and with the multiplayer feature, it's definitely worth trying out.</p>
<p>PC players might be especially interested since they were unfortunately left out of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, the remastered version launched in 2019 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p>Amazon’s Prime Video is following up their smash hit Fallout series with another video game adaption based on Sega’s Yakuza series. Because reasons the title has been reversed and the series is call Like a Dragon: Yakuza, rather than Yakuza: Like a Dragon which is the title of the 2020 video game.</p>
<p>There series will span six episodes and is a crime drama directed by Take Masaharu (“100 Yen Love”) and Takimoto Kengo (“Kamen Teacher”) and Takeuchi Ryoma will star as Kiryu Kazuma.</p>


<p>“The series’ story is set in two time periods, 1995 and 2005, and follows the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity,” say Amazon.</p>

<p>“I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into ‘Like a Dragon: Yakuza’,” said director Take.</p>

<p>“The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch,” said James Farrell, head of international originals, Amazon MGM Studios.</p>
<p>There series will be released in two batches of three episodes with the first landing on October 25th 2024 and the remaining episodes following a week later on November 1st.&nbsp; It’s not explicitly stated but it seems this will be a Japanese langauge series but will come with subtitles and dubs for over thirty languages.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-development-is-very-far-along-leaker-claims-said-to-be-a-multi-platform-title/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Development on the rumored Final Fantasy 9 Remake is progressing well, and Square Enix might very well release the game before April 2025.</p>
<p>At least, that's what known SEGA/Atlus leaker 'Midori' said on X some hours ago. Last month, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various claims</a> from other leakers, 'Midori' <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-is-happening-confirms-leaker-unlike-ffx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the remake is indeed happening. No additional details were shared last month, but the leaker (known for his SEGA/Atlus leaks), has now provided more information about the remake. According to 'Midori', the remake was initially outsourced to a different development, but development has shifted as publisher Square Enix wasn't satisfied. Although the leaker can't confirm a release date for the remake, development on the title is now "very far along", and could be released before the end of Square Enix's current fiscal year (which runs through March 31, 2025).</p>
<p>"According to conversations, the title was originally outsourced to another developer, but SQEX was not satisfied and development shifted", the leaker wrote on X.</p>
<p>'Midori' <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797838848011227419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a>, "Development of this title is now very far along, but I do not have any firm information on the scope of this title or a firm release period right now. This title could release before the end of this fiscal year, but I am not certain right now."</p>
<p>While it's possible that Final Fantasy 9 Remake, which is said to be released as a multi-platform title, will be present at the Xbox Showcase this Sunday, the leaker advises to keep expectations in check as he isn't sure that this is the case.</p>
<div data-md="221" data-hveid="CBEQAA" data-ved="2ahUKEwiOsYbV1sGGAxUA_rsIHWaCDK8QnKEBKAB6BAgWEAA">
<p>"There are plans for new information on some SQEX titles at the Xbox Showcase. I don’t know if this title will be at the showcase. So it is good to keep expectations low right now. And this is a title that is currently planned for release on multiple platforms", the leaker also said on X.</p>
</div>

<p>Personally, we would love to see a remake of 2000's Final Fantasy 9, which was released for the original PlayStation, and is considered one of the best entries in the franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-later-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Amazon will release a new live-action TV series based on Sega's Yakuza games later this year.
</p>
<p>
Like a Dragon: Yakuza will be exclusive to Prime Video and release globally on 25th October.
</p>
<p>
Japanese actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi (who cameoed in Detective Pikachu, among other roles) will take on the lead role of Kazuma Kiryu, while Masaharu Take (The Naked Director) will direct.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The series will span two time periods - 1995 and 2005 - and will follow "the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity". 
</p>
<p>
This hints it'll be, perhaps, based on the first game in the series, which takes place in 2005 following events 10 years before.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly honoured to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series," said Takeuchi. "I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. Audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back."
</p>
<p>
Take said he has "poured out [his] heart, soul, and the experience that [he has] garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza", noting 2024 is fittingly the year of the dragon.
</p>
<p>
"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza's script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series," said Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryugagotoku studio and executive producer on the TV series. "It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create."
</p>
<p>
He added: "While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises."
</p>
<p>
The TV series is yet another indication of the success of the series, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">sold 21.3m units in total</a>. The most recent game, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.



</p>
<p>
Ironically enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-was-flat-out-rejected-by-sega-in-its-first-proposal-says-series-creator">Sega "flat out rejected" the first proposal for the game</a>, presuming it wouldn't attract mass audiences.

</p>
<p>
Yet the TV series is likely to do just that, especially following the success of Amazon's Fallout series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">Fallout was watched by 65 million people</a> in its first 16 days of release and has already been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Just Cause developer Avalanche is shutting two of its five offices, one of which had been open for less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Last night, the company announced it will close down its New York and Montreal studios. As a result of these closures, 50 employees will be laid off, equating to roughly nine percent of Avalanche's overall workforce.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr">statement</a> shared on Avalanche's website, the studio called these closures an "exceptionally difficult decision", but one it believed "necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company".</p>

</figure>
<p>"Our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time," it continued. "We're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players."</p>
<p>Avalanche opened its New York office in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-opens-new-york-studio">2011</a>, while the <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal">Montreal office only opened in October last year</a>, following the acquisition of Monster Closet Games. At this time, the company called this acquisition "a fantastic way to start our new chapter".</p>
<p>Avalanche is sadly one of many studios to suffer layoffs and closures this year. According to an archive tallying layoffs across the industry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs</a> across the video game industry in 2024 alone. Others impacted include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix</a>, and this is merely scratching the surface.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Sony's State of Play over and a Nintendo Direct possibly coming later this month, all eyes are focused on Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase, which is slated to go live on Sunday, June 9, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant among Xbox fans, and today, Spanish leaker eXtas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCFmKwQIo0Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has added extra fuel with some rumors from his own sources.</a> To start with, he said that a first-party Xbox game will be shadow-dropped during the showcase.</p>
<p>This means it will be released in some capacity right away. It could be a beta, a demo, or a full release. The most likely game to be shadow-dropped is Towerborne, the side-scrolling fantasy action game once known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusive-project-belfry-2d-action-ghibli-vanillaware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Belfry</a>. Developed by Stoic (the makers of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-banner-saga-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Banner Saga</a>), Towerborne is set in a post-apocalyptic (but colorful) world where the so-called Aces are all that stands between the monsters and the safety of the titular tower.</p>
<p>Players will be able to fight solo with NPC companions or with other players in a group of four. That's also the number of fighting styles available in the game, with unique moves available for War Clubs, Gauntlets, Dual Daggers, and Swords &amp; Shields. The world map will continue to evolve over time with seasonal content to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>eXtas also said that Microsoft might share a teaser about the long-rumored Xbox Portable console. Rumors on Xbox handhelds <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-release-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> in the last few months, and even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-discussed-once-again-by-microsofts-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed</a> to tease something of the sort in an interview at GDC 2024.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the Xbox Games Showcase, it's worth reminding earlier rumors, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> from id Software and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears 6</a> from The Coalition. The Perfect Dark reboot, in development at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-will-be-shown-next-month-recent-rumors-might-have-been-outdated-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be featured at the upcoming show.</p>
<p>Other likely candidates for an appearance include Avowed, Ara: History Untold, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Microsoft Flight Simulator, all of which should get release dates since they are 2024 games. Looking at the 2025 lineup, we might also see Clockwork Revolution, State of Decay 3, South of Midnight, and Fable.</p>

<p>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your <em>favourite</em> door? Soz, pal. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">Strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest. I’ve played it, and it’s very exciting stuff, not least for how differently it plays than what I’d expected.</p>

<p>Tactical Breach Wizards comes from Suspicious Developments, founded by former game journo and RPS contributor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/tom-francis">Tom Francis</a>. All these disclaimers are enough to make me hopeful that someone will someday pay me, Nic Reuben, to write the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams, but I digress (call me). The studio’s previous work includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gunpoint">Gunpoint</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>. Both are well-loved, but thankfully, neither look to infringe on my concept for the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.)</p>

<p>The first thing I’d like to make absolutely clear about Tee-Bee-Dubs, if only for my past self who tends to form unwieldy assumptions based on singular screenshots, is that it has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM</a> 2012 or its progeny. Ok, so ‘nothing to do’ might be a bit of a stretch. It still offers turn-based, grid-aligned tactics. Your team still boasts contrasting and complimentary skills. Also, there’s still cover, although you have to actively duck behind it. In terms of how it actually feels to play, though, it’s miles away from XCOM’s lengthy, ultra-deadly skirmishes of attrition. I’m using XCOM as an example here, but Wizard’s sleekly designed, eminently solvable, room-by-room discrete puzzles mean it stands proudly and refreshingly apart from the glut of XCOM’s grandkids we’ve had in the intervening…12 years! If anyone needs me I’ll be reconstituting myself from the salt sachet of dust I currently reside in.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Here, you’re less concerned about a stray Muton headbutting your beloved sniper to death (I have played other tactics games I swear), and more about cleanly and efficiently solving whatever configuration of bastards and windows the current room throws at you, in as few moves as possible. Any actions taken are effectively just plans, as you can both redo turns and scry possible enemy responses. You don’t commit to things until you thwack that end turn button like you’re furiously wishlisting the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.) All this is just a taster to the main event, though. An amuse-bouche to the amusement of boofing bods rudely out of windows.</p>
<p>You know you’re in for a cracking time when, alongside scores for speed and efficiency, the results screen bookending each room tallies up your total, and I quote, defenestrations. In TBW’s implied quest to throw absolutely everything that breathes through glass, some abilities are more efficient than others, but even basic attacks all feature some sort of knockback. And, wouldn’t you know it, these compact room-levels are effectively just window delivery systems. When a room has no windows, you know Mr. Francis is incredibly serious. I’m not yet sure from the chunk of demo I played if there’s any evolution on these currently windows-only environmental hazards, but that’d be neat, wouldn’t it? Not that I don’t like windows. I would have had to quickly abandon the game in disgust if I didn’t.</p>
<p>There will be some evolutions though, no doubt. Each level gives you a chance to flesh out the skills of your wizards with perk points. There’s a host of other lovely details I’d like to quickly cram in, right down to the incredibly minor. The graphics settings have cute names like ‘practical peach blizzards’ and such. The bit on the menu screen for patch notes currently says ‘fixed: demo didn’t exist’. I love this sort of thing. It’s the kind of minor attention to detail that promises similar love elsewhere, nice little pre-gags to warm you up, like arriving at the pub to find there’s a shot already waiting for you on the bar. It’s also just a very funny game in general, although there’s plenty of hints towards a more involved story as your progress. At this point, it’d take a serious hex to stop me diving into the full game when it releases, as if by magic, at some unspecified point in the future. Hopefully, sooner than the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me.)</p>

        <p>"Nobody is shutting us down. We are going into hibernation because we are done with this project," clarified co-owner Nate Austin</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Wildermyth developer Worldwalker Games will be on a hiatus for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://x.com/wildermyth/status/1795872859232813087">social media</a>, the studio's co-owner Nate Austin shared that active development on the 2021 RPG is now complete and players shouldn't expect new content. The team will continue supporting Wildermyth with bug fixes, and the console port is still on the cards.</p>
<p>He clarified that the studio's hibernation is not a reflection of poor performances or other troubles, but simply what was planned all along now that the project is over.</p>
<p>Austin however added that Worldwalker will be "saying farewell to many of [its] team members."</p>
<p>"Wildermyth has been wonderful, but nothing goes on forever," Austin said. "We wanted to ship [DLC] Omenroad, and having done that we're ready to move on. This was the plan, and it doesn't have anything to do with how well Omenroad is going."</p>
<p>He added: "We're an independent studio, which means we're not answerable to investors. Nobody is shutting us down. We are going into hibernation because we are done with this project."</p>
<p>He concluded by saying that he's "pretty sure" that the team will "eventually find something else to pour [their] passion into, and that it'll be communicated to players "when the time comes"</p>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the massive success of <em>Fallout</em> on Prime Video, Amazon is heading back into the world of video games for another blockbuster series, with <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> set to release later this year. </p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Made up of six episodes, the Amazon original series is directed by Masaharu Take and stars Ryoma Takeuchi, known for his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in <em>Kamen Rider Drive</em>. The series will feature six episodes, split into two parts, with the first released on October 25 and the second on November 1, 2024. </p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The big announcement took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 4, with both Take and Takeuchi in attendance. Amazon stated that <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be “a live-action adaptation with an original story based on SEGA’s global hit game franchise.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Masaharu Take directs while Ryoma Takeuchi stars. Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">In a press release, lead Ryoma Takeuchi said he was “truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu,” and told fans to look forward to “intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.” Director Masaharu Take echoed these thoughts, explaining that he has “poured [his] heart, soul, and the experience that [he] has garnered over 35 years into <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza.</em></p>
 <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Masayoshi Yokoyama, who wrote the script for the first <em>Yakuza</em> game is also onboard, serving as an executive producer on the series. “Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original <em>Yakuza</em>‘s script, I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series,” he stated. “It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create.”</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">The release of <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will see Amazon dip back into the world of gaming following the monumental success of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-tv-show-sparks-a-surge-in-popularity-for-the-games-on-steam/">Fallout</a></em>. The series based on Bethesda’s iconic franchise was a massive success, setting a new record for the most watched title ever among adults 18-34 in the first 16 days of release, and sits just behind <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> for the company’s most successful launch ever. </p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">While we don’t know too much about the story of <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> just yet, we expect to hear more and see our first glimpses of the show throughout the summer. </p>

        <p>50 employees have been let go across both studios</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Avalanche Studios Group has announced the closure of its Montreal and New York studios, resulting in layoffs for 50 employees.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on its <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr">website</a>, the developer said the shuttering of these offices was "necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company."</p>
<p>"Our focus is now on supporting [those affected] through this challenging time," it continued. "We're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players."</p>
<p>The Montreal office hadn't been open for long, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-studios-to-open-montreal-office">having launched last October</a> following the acquisition of Montreal-based developer Monster Closet Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-opens-new-york-studio">Avalanche's New York studio opened in 2011</a>, and was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/avalanche-cut-stuff-in-new-york-and-stockholm-offices">affected by staff cuts in 2015</a> alongside the Stockholm office following the release of Just Cause 3 and Mad Max.</p>

			<p><span data-contrast="auto">Originally a 3DS title released back in 2015, Legend of Legacy is the latest of a series of JRPGs to be given the HD Remaster treatment for modern consoles. I didn’t get a chance to play this back in the day, but I was aware of the game and later fell in love with The Alliance Alive from the same studio, so where better to jump in than a remaster?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered - Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPWk721vZq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Picking your hero from a small selection and then naming them, you’re thrown onto the Isle of Avalon with a small party of adventurers and, after a short interlude with the Lord of the island in Initium, begin exploring the island to search out its secrets. Within this world, you will engage in all the standard JRPG trimmings including fights, dungeons, chatting with NPCs and recruiting new party members to join your increasingly motley crew.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="auto">The main objective is to explore the various regions of the world. As you wander around, you will slowly fill in the maps, with a satisfying little pencil scratching noise when you complete one. Each area is split into smaller ones, with each one having its own map to complete. Then once you have completed all the maps in an area, you can sell them back to the Shop in Initium. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be aware you can only sell a map set once, regardless of how completed it might be at the time, so if you still have some corners of a map to fill in make sure you do so before you trade it in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The combat takes place in a standard turn-based format with standard roles in place, and your archetypal medieval weapons to use. You’ll take turns with the enemy hitting each other, and the ones that survive the hitting win. However, this would be a dull experience if that’s all there was to it, and Legend of Legacy has got you covered with a host of neat little twists on the formula.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first and biggest is a twist found in the combat system – Formations. This allows you to change around the placements of your party members each turn depending on where and how you might need them. For instance, you might need to move your lower defense characters to the back row to reduce the damage they take while you heal the party or bring your tankier character forward to defend the others.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the Formations you can assign each party member a position based on their role for this next turn, whether that be guarding other party members, attacking enemies or supporting the other members. There are presets for this, but you can create your own Formations to best suit how you play the game, and they can be further customised as you unlock new stances during your journey.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You’ll also be at the whim of the Elementals in the world. These mysterious entities will have a particular effect over the areas you walk through, with the compass in the top right indicating if a particular element is strong there. You can engage with Spirit-Perches to increase an element’s power in the nearby area. This can alter aspects of the world around it or create a contract with that element for battles.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These contracts are how the magic system works in Legend of Legacy. When you have a contract with an element and the correct Charm equipped, you can cast powerful spells in battle. Also, an element’s strength in an area will also have a passive effect on the battle such as a prevalence of air increasing defence against physical skills for both your party and all enemies too. So, this needs to be balanced very carefully.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Oh, and if you try to cast a spell without a contract active, it will just fail, so that’s fun too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As another quirk of the gameplay, your characters don’t level up in the standard way in JRPGs, instead falling into a system much like Final Fantasy II. You gain stat increases from battles occasionally, but these are randomised stat increases based on the usage of the characters. This also extends to your abilities, with new abilities (called ‘Arts’) for weapons being learned as you use that specific weapon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is where my biggest bugbear with this game rears its head. As your stat increases are randomised and weapon skills linked to that weapon’s use, it quite literally crushes any reason to experiment. There’s no point changing your weapons based on new types you find – no matter if they might be better against a new enemy – as you’re back at square one with no abilities for this new weapon, lowering your character’s efficacy dramatically.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Worse still, this also applies to the new potential party members you meet. As these new characters haven’t been “used” they start at the beginning with few Arts and none of the stat increases you have gained on your party. So, you only really benefit from sticking with the same party the whole time, which was a huge mood killer for me personally when I acquired the cute little frog guy and had to grind to make him at all&nbsp;useful.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you get into the groove with it, the gameplay is&nbsp;smooth, with most battles taking a matter of moments to play out. The only exceptions to this being the stark and sudden spikes in difficulty that happen throughout the game. I have to say though that these spikes do bring excitement to the game, especially considering that the narrative is&nbsp;incredibly intermittent in how it’s told, and the exploration is repetitive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the difficulty spikes though, the worst thing to happen if your entire party drops to 0HP is being returned to the beginning of the current area you are exploring. It still feels a touch unfair to be blindsided by an enemy far stronger than anything else around it without warning, but the overall penalty isn’t terrible even if it’s inconvenient.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All this said, one area this game doesn’t scrimp on is the presentation. The chibi character design and colourful storybook effect on the design of the world perfectly mesh to create clear and beautiful visual style. This style was gorgeous already on the 3DS, but the HD remaster really enhances the visuals. Then&nbsp;when paired with the simple but effective score, you have a game that just FEELS handcrafted with care.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced a&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>&nbsp;TV series, and it's airing on Prime Video later this year.&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will span six episodes, three of which will arrive in late October, with the remaining three set to debut the following week.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-to-premiere-like-a-dragon-yakuza-an-am" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, Amazon says the series will feature an "original story" based on the franchise, so it doesn't sound as if&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will adapt any particular game in the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-new-like-dragon-games-announced-at-rgg-summit">nee&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em></a>) series.</p>

<p>With that being said, it sounds like the series will hew pretty closely to the first game; it'll take place in 1995 and 2005 and will feature Kazuma Kiryu as its protagonist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-yakuza-kiwami.jpg?itok=7ZDUZ2vj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video-yakuza-kiwami.jpg?itok=v8rzbfqP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>seems like it'll be at least partially based on the original&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>(although the remake&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami&nbsp;</em>is pictured here).</figcaption></figure><p>Stepping into the rather intimidatingly large shoes of Kiryu is actor Ryoma Takeuchi, who played the main role in&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider Drive</em>&nbsp;and also provided the Japanese dub for Tim Goodman in&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;<em>Detective Pikachu</em>.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>will be directed by Masaharu Take, a movie and TV director whose works include&nbsp;<em>100 Yen Love</em>, which was submitted (but not nominated) as the Japanese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2015 Oscars.</p>

<p>Take says that he's "poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years" into the series, and that it's fitting that&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>should be released in "the year of the dragon".</p>

<p>For his part, Takeuchi says he's "truly honored" to be playing Kazuma Kiryu. He playfully directs viewers to "take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back". Sounds like those iconic shirtless rooftop battles will make an appearance in the show.</p>

Hopefully, we'll get to see regulars like Goro Majima and Haruka Sawamura develop their relationships with Kiryu.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>seems to be part of a push Prime Video is making to create more shows based on video games.</p>

<p>It joins the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke">critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em></a>, which launched earlier this year, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series</a>, which boasts the involvement of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>

<p>We'll get to see how&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>handles the story of Kazuma Kiryu when its first three episodes arrive on Prime Video on October 25th. The concluding three episodes will subsequently arrive on November 1st.</p>

			<p>Today, SEGA <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-to-premiere-like-a-dragon-yakuza-an-am" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it has partnered with Amazon Prime Video to release Like a Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action TV adaptation of the acclaimed roleplaying game series.</p>
<p>The show will be available globally starting on October 25. Comprised of six episodes, it will be released in two tranches: three episodes on October 25 and another three on November 1. According to the press release, this will be an original story set across two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is directed by Masaharu Take and Kengo Takimoto, with Erik Barmack, Roberto Grande, and Joshua Long listed as executive producers.</p>
<p>Protagonista Kazuma Kiryu will be played by popular Japanese actor Ryoma Takeuchi, who explained:</p>
<p><em>I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character in the game series. I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. The audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.</em></p>
<p>Masayoshi Yokoyama, Head of RYUGAGOTOKU Studio and Executive Producer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original “Yakuza“'s script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could —and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I'd love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world—experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the latest entry in the game series, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, launched earlier this year to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical</a> and commercial acclaim.</p>
<p>This is just the latest game franchise translated into a live action TV series.

<p>Prime Video is shaping up to receive another banger of a live-action adaptation later this year, with the sudden announcement that a Like a Dragon: Yakuza series is heading to the platform in October. This reveal came out of nowhere, shocking fans worldwide and drawing an immediate sentiment of anticipation, given the recent success of the series and Prime’s adaptations thus far (I’m looking at you, Fallout).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sudden-strike">Sudden Strike</h2>



<p>RGG Studio took to social media to share an image promoting the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series for the first time with almost nothing in the way of a preface. It was a simple drop that stunned audiences, with RGG offering a date and a platform – October 24 on Prime Video.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make the choice to take the next step. Like a Dragon: Yakuza comes to Prime Video October 24. <a href="https://t.co/Pn2gKQzqlK">pic.twitter.com/Pn2gKQzqlK</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1797826081166184839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s a live-action adaptation starring Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, the iconic lead of the series and one of gaming’s suavest and most capable fighters. Takeuchi is best known for his voice work and live-action roles in productions hailing almost exclusively from Japan, and his career thus far has been contained almost solely to a string of television shows.</p>



<p>Fans have had a mixed reception to the casting, but many agree that they’ll wait and see Takeuchi in the role of Kiryu before they pass judgment.</p>

It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005. </p><p>Similar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show’s press release as a “fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity”, and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include “​​intense fighting scenes”, alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.</p><p>The series was announced today at a press conference at the picturesque Hotel Gajoen Tokyo. At the event, Takeuchi and Take discussed the process of adapting the acclaimed game series for a live-action drama. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/yakuza-show-1717470220217.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Director Masaharu Take and actor Ryoma Takeuchi at today's announcement.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of the tattoo on his back and sculpting his body for the role, as seen in the key visual image released today, Takeuchi said, “You can’t play Kiryu Kazuma without getting into shape, so I knew I had to throw myself into it. This was a job not only for me but also for the costume and makeup teams. It took two and a half hours just to prepare for this shot.”</p><p>He added, “It’s partly Kiryu Kazuma and it’s partly me. I got so close to the part that it was hard to distinguish where he ended and I began. That included getting into shape for the part, the costume and so on. Rather than acting the part of Kiryu, I feel like he became part of the family.”</p><p>Director Take said, “Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.”</p><p>Of Kiryu’s place in the story, Take said, “In 1995, the protagonist is still young and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he gets out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.”</p><p>Taking their positions in front of a golden folding screen emblazoned with a dragon reminiscent of the tattoo on Kiryu’s back, the actor and director made a symbolic prayer for the show’s success.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/img-8734-1717470697624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ryoma Takeuchi will star as iconic Yakuza character Kiryu Kazuma in the upcoming series.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Meet the new Kazuka Kiryu</h2><p>Takeuchi broke through with his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in multiple Kamen Rider projects.

Prime members in Japan enjoy savings, convenience, and entertainment, all in a single membership.</p><p>Released in 2005 by SEGA, the <em>Yakuza</em> game series was positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience. The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamurocho, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward’s Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. The much-loved game has captured the attention and hearts of fans not only in Japan but also internationally and will now be adapted, developed, and streamed worldwide on Prime Video. </p><p>In 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time-periods, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, an original <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch. We are committed to augmenting our content library and are confident that <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will strike a chord with audiences all over the world.”</p><p><strong><a title="People > Masayoshi Yokoyama [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/people/masayoshi-yokoyama">Masayoshi Yokoyama</a>, Producer and Studio Head, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</strong></p><p>“Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original <em>Yakuza</em>‘s script, I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I’d want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could—and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will become another landmark release for the <em>Like a Dragon</em> series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I’m sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I’d love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world—experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
