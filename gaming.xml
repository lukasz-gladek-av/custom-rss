                <p>If there's one thing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bloodborne-review/1900-6416078/" data-ref-id="1900-6416078">Bloodborne</a> fans are clear on, it's that they want more Bloodborne. As nearly a decade has passed since its release and Sony has yet to revisit the franchise with another game, some indie developers have taken it upon themselves to make their own Bloodborne games. The latest unofficial Bloodborne game in development, Bloodborne: Top Down Arena, gives the title a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">Diablo-like action-RPG</a> makeover. While the project is far from finished, the game's creator, Maxime Foulquier, has posted a video that shows the gameplay in action.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS! I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena<br>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it 😂 <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>  — Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As Foulquier noted in the tweet above, he originally had more ambitious plans to remake Bloodborne before he abandoned that out of fear of getting a cease-and-desist from Sony. The video features the Hunter fighting a few enemies, and it makes Bloodborne seem well suited for an entire game in this format.</p><p>Foulquier also <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that Bloodborne: Top Down Arena is different enough from the original Bloodborne to escape a takedown notice from Sony. That's why he doesn't plan to release it on Steam. He also acknowledged that another fan creation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-kart-is-releasing-soon-with-a-new-legally-distinct-name/1100-6522387/" data-ref-id="1100-6522387">Bloodborne Kart</a>, had to be delayed and completely reworked to avoid legal consequences from Sony. However, keeping the Bloodborne name on his own game may only invite Sony's lawyers to go after Foulquier as well.</p><p>Until Sony gets back around to Bloodborne, fan content may be the only way to get anything new. One of the most intriguing fan-made projects is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-graceborne-mod-brings-bloodborne-to-the-lands-between/1100-6524641/" data-ref-id="1100-6524641">Graceborne</a>, an Elden Ring mod that brings elements that originated in From Software's previous title into the developer's current franchise. That title is currently in its alpha stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-cs2-ranks-how-to-get-global-elite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) is one of the biggest esports out there. Even after its predecessor, CS:GO, handed the game the torch, Counter-Strike has continued to thrive. But do you know of all the ranks in CS2 competitive?</p>



<p>Here are all the CS2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cs2-ranks">CS2 Ranks</h2>



<p>CS2 ranks fall under a much more complicated system than many other games. To heavily reward players, ranks are not thrown around lightly within the shooter. With 18 ranks as a whole, CS2 has one of the most immersive and impressive ranking systems.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-cs2-ranks">All CS2 Ranks:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Silver 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distinguished Master Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supreme Master First Class</strong></li>



<li><strong>Global Elite</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While these are the traditional CS2 ranks, the game also has Premiere Mode, which is a more popular ranked system. </p>







<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-2-premiere-mode-ranks">All Counter-Strike 2 Premiere Mode Ranks</h2>



<p>Premiere mode, unlike regular CS2 ranked, requires players to pick and vote on maps to ban before competing. After winning 10 placements in Premiere, you will be given a rating, which is a bit different from the system in the game’s traditional ranked mode.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all Premiere mode ranks in CS2 compared to the game’s traditional ranks:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1,000 – 7,501 (Gray):</strong> Equivalent to Silver Elite Master</li>



<li><strong>7,502 – 11,831 (Light Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Gold Nova 1 to Gold Nova Master</li>



<li><strong>11,832 – 14,998 (Dark Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Master Guardian to Master Guardian Elite</li>



<li><strong>14,999 – 18,401 (Light Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Distinguished Master Guardian to Legendary Eagle Master</li>



<li><strong>18,402 – 19,999 (Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Supreme Master First Class</li>



<li><strong>20,000+ (Dark Purple):</strong> Equivalent to the Global Elite</li>
</ul>



<p>The Counter-Strike Premiere mode is much more focused on points than it is on actual ranks. Still, though, players should be striving to hit Dark Purple, which is the equivalent to Global Elite in the game’s regular ranking system.</p>



<p>To rank up, simply winning matches will skyrocket you through the ranked system, but beware, the competition will be extremely difficult later on, as CS2 has a much more precise competitive base than other games.</p>



<p>What rank are you in Counter-Strike 2?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-ii-tides-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-2298">Warcraft 2</a>: Remastered looks to be in the cards, as an "internal alpha" containing a logo and artwork was recently discovered on Blizzard's servers.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/warcraft-ii-remastered-internal-alpha-new-blizzard-catalog-entry-added-349660" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the leak comes from Blizzard's own CDN (content delivery network) servers. One of Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness' big innovations back in 1995 was its focus on naval and airborne combat, and the leaked internal alpha includes artwork showcasing a human warship sailing on a stormy sea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395489"></a><figcaption>Leaked artwork for Warcraft 2: Remastered, via Wowhead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4395489-warcraft2remasteredleakedart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is currently gearing up for the Warcraft franchise's 30th anniversary, and will be hosting a livestream on November 13 to celebrate. The developer has stated the stream will have "something for everyone," including fans of the old Warcraft strategy games. There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">no BlizzCon this year</a>, so fans are expecting some big announcements normally reserved for Blizzard's annual fan convention to instead be made during the 30th anniversary-stream.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly makes it seem like Warcraft 2: Remastered will be announced during the livestream, but Blizzard so far has not officially announced the game. It wouldn't be the first classic Blizzard title to receive the remaster treatment, with Blizzard having previously remastered the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-20">StarCraft</a> in 2017 as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a> in 2021 as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also, infamously, remastered one of the most beloved RTS games of all time with 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>. Often hailed as Blizzard's first "bad game," the remaster for many fans wasn't what was originally promised, and in many ways felt like a step down from the original Warcraft 3. The reception to Warcraft 3: Reforged was so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-expands-refund-requests-for-warcraft-3-re/1100-6473492/" data-ref-id="1100-6473492">Blizzard offered "no-questions asked" refunds</a>, with a later report stating the game was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-a-victim-of-mismanagement-pressure-from-activision-and-budget-cuts-report/1100-6494287/" data-ref-id="1100-6494287">victim of budget cuts and mismanagement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is evidence to suggest Blizzard may be giving Warcraft 3: Reforged a redo as well. A Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-might-be-floating-a-warcraft-3-reforged-relaunch/1100-6510801/" data-ref-id="1100-6510801">survey asking players about a potential Reforged relaunch</a> last year generated headlines. Last month, the game's public test realm servers briefly showed an unannounced 2.0 build before being removed several hours later, but nothing has been officially announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Not content to wait for an official Blizzard remaster, fans have already taken to updating Warcraft 2 for the modern age. One fan project, called Warcraft: Chronicles of War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impressive-warcraft-2-fan-remake-using-warcraft-3-reforged-is-available-now/1100-6520147/" data-ref-id="1100-6520147">reimagines Warcraft 2 using Warcraft 3: Reforged's engine</a>. Its Horde campaign is currently playable for free for those who already own Reforged.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans wait for more news during the 30th anniversary-livestream, Blizzard has offered a number of ways to celebrate the franchise across its various games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Warcraft-themed skins in Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's latest update is almost entirely centered around the game's 20th anniversary, letting players tackle "Timewalking" versions of original WoW dungeons and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">earn updated versions of some of the game's most iconic armor sets</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sorry, lovers of hats on pets; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has warned players to stop adorning their fluffy friends with fancy headwear, as doing so currently appears to be causing performance drops in the latest version of the farm life sim.
</p>
<p>
The ability to put hats on pets is, of course, arguably the most significant feature to be added to Stardew Valley (or indeed any game ever) as part of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">chunky 1.6 update</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">mobile and consoles</a>. But, unfortunately, it seems the ensuing cuteness overload is proving just too much for the game to handle behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853889827294650577">shared the news</a> in a post on social media, telling players, "If you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets." There's probably a very sensible, serious technical reason for the performance drop, but because this is Stardew Valley, fans have demanded an official in-game lore explanation for the sudden required removal of pet hats, and Barone has <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853890739413082199">happily obliged</a>.

"There's rumours of a strange rash affecting pets' ears in Zuzu City," Barone explained, "and we just want to make sure those ears can breath for a few days." Thankfully, pets won't be permanently denied their adorable headwear and Barone has promised, "We will address the problem as soon as possible."

Hat-related performance drops are far from the only bug to emerge following Stardew Valley's 1.6 update on consoles and mobile, but it's so far the most amusing, even in a game where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-blames-missing-chicken-bug-on-a-pesky-wild-coyote-running-amuck">chickens are suddenly vanishing en masse</a>. But the good news is fixes are in the works - and mobile players can even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-on-mobile-now-includes-a-secret-experimental-multiplayer-mode-unlocked-with-the-konami-code">try out a (no longer) secret multiplayer mode</a> while they wait.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>remaster may have just been leaked ahead of a major celebration for the franchise's 30th anniversary, which is due to take place next week.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gkkzj1/warcraft_2_remastered_internal_alpha_leaked_via/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Neggy5</a>, a <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w2rd?type=versions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new listing on tracking site BlizzTrack</a>, which monitors changes in the backend of the company's Battle.net service, points to the existence of an internal alpha test for something called&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>All things considered, it's pretty difficult to imagine that this is anything other than a reworked modern version of the seminal 1995 RTS, which was originally titled&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=PEyMoc8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=Eas5tPeJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A remaster of classic 1995 RTS&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing gives practically nothing away, as you might imagine, but it does potentially confirm the existence of a remaster that may well be announced during next week's celebration.</p>

<p>According to the Redditor who discovered the listing, an upcoming update for the controversial&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>was also discovered on the BlizzTrack website, so it seems that Blizzard's attempts to redeem that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans">ill-received rework</a> also continue, although the nature of said update hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that none of this has officially been confirmed; this could well just be an experimental attempt on Blizzard's part to go through options rather than a confirmation that something concrete is in the works.</p>

<p>Still, the timing of this leak seems pretty serendipitous with the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream due to air next week, so I wouldn't be surprised if a&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>announcement was officially made at that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=ScnB5hX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=wGY516Vx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard recently released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>The War Within</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream airs a few months after Blizzard released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>, the tenth major expansion for the long-running MMORPG, which launched back in August.</p>

<p>It's also arriving after developers on said MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union</a> back in July, which essentially means said union represents the entire studio rather than a single unit within the company.</p>

Here, the <em>only</em> way to add new cards to your deck is to engage with systems that endlessly encourage you to spend real-world money within the app, on top of an array of other systems that peter out just before you’re done, unless you fork out. And when it comes to <em>Pokémon</em>, that feels <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>I’m a fool, but not <em>that</em> big of a fool. I get why free-to-play mobile games are designed to encourage their users to spend money. These products are not charities, they’re businesses, and this is a model that has proven to be enormously lucrative. Exploitative, controversial, and in some countries even illegal, but undeniably successful.

If you want to compare it to the video games world, the next largest property is <em>Mario</em> at a measly $57 billion. There’s a reason this property, primarily focused on children and those who loved it as children, can afford to run <em>TCG Live</em> for free. And, of course, this total was estimated before The Pokémon Company ever dipped its toes in the toxic waters of gacha gaming. What I’m saying is, while any corporation always wants infinitely more money, <em>Pocket</em> isn’t a last-gasp attempt to survive from a struggling business. It’s not an essential move to calm bailing shareholders. It’s just a pure act of astonishing greed aimed at children.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974"><em>Pokémon</em> Fan Calculates How Long It Will Take To Collect Every Card In <em>TCG Pocket</em></a></span></p><p>There’s a version of <em>Pocket</em> that could have existed and would have made sense from The Pokémon Company, co-owned by Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and Game Freak. It’s a stripped-down, <em>Marvel Snap</em>-like card game with an option to pay for a battle pass. And that’s it. It’d make a <em>fortune</em>. As it is, this new app offers a Premium Pass that looked like it was going to be a battle pass equivalent for a rather pricey $10 a month. It’s there. Beyond that, all the other systems could have been powered by in-game actions. It’d be a great solution for an IP aimed at kids, while also loved by adults; like <em>Fortnite</em>, if your kid really gets into it, buy them a Premium Pass to enjoy it even more. Buy yourself one. Go wild.</p><p>Instead, what we really have is an app that’s been built from the ground up to exploit its players, building gambling loops where real-world money can be spent on opening sealed packs in the hope of scoring rare rewards.</p><p> This is no better underlined by the game’s only imposed limit on spending, which it says will prevent players from using more than 750 Poké Gold a day to open packs. That amount of Gold would cost $120 per day. That’s where this app draws the line. And there are no options to add your own personalized spending limits to help protect those prone to overspending or getting hooked—surely the most basic good-faith offering that should be in place. </p><h2 id="h3638"><a id=""></a>From training to draining</h2><figure id="" data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-recommend-id="image://8857ee1334e5441e44062a1439a7ff33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of cards available in Pocket, on a blue background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, there is absolutely and unequivocally a legitimate way to enjoy <em>Pocket</em> without spending any money. The early waterfall of in-game currencies is enough to unlock yourself enough cards to start building rudimentary decks, and the so-called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908">Wonder Picks</a></span> and 12-hourly free packs mean you always have a way to gain more. With these, you can take part in the game’s battles against the CPU or other players, and while crude, it’s a reasonably enjoyable game. (It’s impossible not to add that if you’re used to the full version of the TCG, it’s oddly frustrating to have such a repetitive deck, no Stadium cards, and so few Trainers and Tools.) So yes, it is possible to play <em>Pocket</em> for free. It’s just that’s clearly not what’s intended.</p><p>In fact, to even be able to access the battles, you’re <em>forced</em> to go through all of the loops that’ll eventually be suggesting you pay real money. You must go through tutorials that have you opening pack after pack after pack, picking Wonder Picks, and displaying your favorite cards for others before the tab to take part in battles unlocks. Even then, you’re dragged through an unskippable series of tiny tutorials, where with each step you complete you just so happen to be rewarded more of those Pack Hourglasses that reduce the time before you can open another pack.</p><p>You’re then given all these Missions–small tasks to complete of an incidental nature, some triggered by competing in battles–that thrust more hourglasses upon you! You’ve now got over 150! That’s like 12 more packs to open! And woah, opening those packs triggered more missions and you’ve got another 40 hourglasses! Three more packs and a few hourglasses to spare! And don’t forget to Wonder Pick! That one-in-five chance of getting a card you half-want unlocks even more rewards right now! Oh, and what’s this, there’s a new type of CPU battle, where you can win the chance to try to pull a Lapras card! And it rewards you yet another type of hourglass to keep trying! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Until it doesn’t!</a></span></p><h2 id="h3639"><a id=""></a>But this is <em>Pokémon</em></h2><p>I keep hearing the voice of the frustrated reader, crying, “Yeah, but it’s a free-to-play app, dumbass. This is what they do.” And I just keep coming back to the same reply: Yeah, but this is <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>I think the <em>Fortnite</em> comparison is a useful one, here. <em>Fortnite </em>is indisputably another product aimed at getting parents to pay unfathomable amounts of money to play a free game. It makes billions of dollars a year, despite being even more blatantly open to being played for free, with its in-game currency sold on plastic cards in every grocery store. My son got piles of V-bucks for his recent birthday, and I pay for his Battle Pass. I’m acutely aware of how well it works. And yet, as problematic as so much of it may be, it’s nothing compared to <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>.</p><p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, there’s nothing on which you can spend real-world money that affords you any advantages. Everything that can be bought is cosmetic, even in the Battle Pass. And that Battle Pass? It lasts 12 weeks (roughly three months) and costs around $9.50. For this, you get regular (cosmetic) rewards for an enormous 200 levels. You get loads, and cannot pay to win.</p><p>In <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, real-world money can buy you access to vastly more packs of cards, Wonder Picks, and turns at Events, all of which can give you significant advantages in the battles. The better your cards, the better your decks, and the more you’ll win. And that Premium Pass? It lasts just one month and costs $10. For this, you get a series of tasks that unlock you…11 Pack Hourglasses, eight Wonder Hourglasses, and 29 “Premium Tickets,” that let you buy a bunch of cosmetics. That’s right—11 of the items anyone wants, less than half as many as you’ll be given for completing a rudimentary mission in your opening hours of the game. Completing everything it offers takes a couple of hours, at most, and then it just sits fallow. You also get one extra pack to open a day, which is really what you’re paying for here. You get so little, and you’re paying to win.</p><p>It’s no surprise that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em> hasn’t even tried to launch in Belgium, where loot boxes are outlawed, and nor in the Netherlands, where a similar law is being sought.</p><h2 id="h3640"><a id=""></a>The Wooloo are gambling</h2><figure id="" data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-recommend-id="image://34853f6ea775c4056ba80cd57a73f258" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mewtwo pack artwork." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a fan of the real-world TCG, I was excited to play this streamlined version, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-1851653373">playing it at Gamescom earlier this year</a></span>. At that preview demo, we weren’t shown any of the gacha elements, and questions about them were responded to with, “We’ll have to get back to you on that.” I said at the time that I feared many more ways to spend Gold other than speeding up pack opening would be revealed by launch, adding, “Gacha plus kids makes me uncomfortable.” But I still let myself hope a bit. It’s <em>Pokémon</em>, right?</p><p>And yes, let’s address the problematic nature of those real-world card packs too. Are they gambling? Very probably, depending on the motivation behind buying them. However, there’s a huge difference for children’s minds in something like a stamina meter that could be refilled with the touch of a button to maintain a feedback loop, and nagging your parent into taking you to the store to buy another $5 pack.</p><p>I feel very sure that in <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, The Pokémon Company has made a big error in judgment. While it already is proving enormously successful (with reports of $20 million made in its first week), the reputational harm that I suspect will follow could outweigh it. I foresee mainstream news stories about kids who’ve spent thousands on cards via their parents’ credit cards, alongside the more specialist press reporting on just how grim the pull rates are when you don’t spend money. Already, the man behind the deeply influential <em>Pokémon</em> news site <em>Serebii</em>, Joe Merrick, has tweeted, saying of the current Lapras event, “It took…10 Pikachu, 8 Clefairy, 6 Mankey and 5 Butterfree. A total of 29 packs before I finally got the Lapras. Now to not touch this event again.”</p><p>After this first week of people experiencing <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>’s initial dopamine rush of endless packs to tear open, and the flow of rewards feeding into satisfying loops, I think we will now see the game’s huge audience collectively hitting the cut-off point, the moment when the dealer suddenly ups his prices now that the drug is in your system. I think it’s going to be reputationally ugly for The Pokémon Company, and I suspect the absolutely god-awful Premium Pass is going to need massive revision ASAP, likely with a heavy dump of apologetic in-game rewards for purchasers (something problematic in itself).</p><p>Yes, once again, this sort of shit is grimly normal in the mobile space, and there’s a vast industry built around the exploitation of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whales</a></span> in free-to-play gacha gaming. Or, let’s call it by its name: gambling. But, yet again, <em>this is Pokémon</em>. It’s Pokémon just undeniably selling gambling to children.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I didn’t have much time to complete such a monumental open-world adventure.

Despite the cost, a heavy dose of nostalgia washed over the community and the open-world western now sits at ‘Very Positive’ on Steam, as of this writing, with thousands of reviews from the community. Of course, like any other game release, you have those posting negative reviews due to the price, boycotting the studio, or are upset because of performance issues. Everyone’s opinion is valid, but take every review with a grain of salt.</p><p>First, let’s start with the positive reviews. There are loads of them, with the clear majority of the many thousands of user reviews left behind being positive. Most of them shout from the rooftops about the game’s stable performance, with plenty of PC-specific graphics settings to tweak the experience. Of course, then you have those proclaiming it’s one of the best stories told in gaming, with the most memorable characters and setpieces. To some extent, they’re not wrong.</p><p>However, even the positive reviews note the price tag associated with the remake. At $50, Rockstar is asking for a lot from long-time fans, especially for such an old port. In fact, the vast majority of negative reviews point towards its price tag as the reason for their review. </p><p>If you’re still considering the recent PC release of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>,

And so all that’s very exciting. And then in certain instances, we’re also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That innocuous mention of a new Virtua Fighter has already set tongues wagging within the fighting game community. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> to tide fans over. IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Could Sega now be ready to release Virtua Fighter 6, nearly 20 years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During The Game Awards 2023, Sega announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023"><u>new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises</u></a> alongside the teaser trailer, below. The video shows brief clips of each of the games set to return.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said its Crazy Taxi reboot, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says">is an open-world, massively multiplayer AAA game</a>. There is no release date yet for the Crazy Taxi reboot or any of the other new games announced at last year's Game Awards. Perhaps we’ll find out more in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Nintendo has shed further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo stated that while it would "not rule out the possibility of further mergers and acquisitions", its current "priority is to organically expand the organisation". This is so "new staff members are able to fully learn and understand our creative culture" at Nintendo.</p>
<p>The Mario maker seldom partakes in acquisitions, only making a handful in recent years. In May, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-acquisition-since-2022-and-its-from-embracer">company acquired Shiver Entertainment</a> from Embracer. Shiver is a studio responsible for porting the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> onto Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>This particular deal marked Nintedo's first acquisition since 2022, when it purchased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-animation-studio-it-will-rename-nintendo-pictures">Dynamo Pictures</a> (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">subsequently became Nintendo Pictures</a>) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-acquiring-long-time-development-partner-srd">SRD</a>. In 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo purchased Next Level Games</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/nintendos_ready_for_acquisitions_when_the_time_is_right">said</a> any acquisitions it makes would be determined by the company's need to keep pace with "rapidly advancing technological innovation". The following year, Nintendo president <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1489149335203815431">Shuntaro Furukawa</a> stated: "Our brand was built upon products crafted with dedication by our employees, and having a large number of people who don’t possess Nintendo DNA in our group would not be a plus to the company."</p>
<p>Then, last year, Furukawa <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nikkei-shuntaro-furukawa-interview-switch-support-until-early-march-2025-increase-in-in-house-developers-and-thought-process-behind-acquisitions.770663/">explained</a> Nintendo does not "reject the use of M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions)", adding "if an organisation that does not understand Nintendo's creative approach is brought into the fold, it may not produce the expected results".</p>
<p>Furukawa closed: "On the other hand, for companies with a similar development approach, we can form various partnerships with them, not limited to M&amp;A."</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> latest major update, From The Rift, is rewinding time all the way back to early 2019 with a new Launch Royale mode, letting you play the game with the original map, the original selection of Legends, weapons and loot, and original gameplay balance. But that’s not all that this update does.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: From the Rift Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve-pSwKn79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a limited time mode, Launch Royale is a step back to the origins of the game, which has evolved and changed an awful lot since 2019 – a time when battle royale still felt rather novel. All of the characters released since then are snuffed back out of existence, you no longer have EVO Armor or Ability Upgrades, and get what many will consider to be a mure pure experience from it.</p>
<p>Old hands will be able to immediately lean back into the early meta of weapons, strategies and drop points, but there’s also some incentives beyond that. Launch Royale Challenges will unlock Legends, earn rewards that include Apex Packs and more.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this season will also see the revival of the original medic and healer character, Lifeline. Outside of Launch Royale, she will sport a new kit that includes teleporting the healing drone direct to allies and dropping a circular healing forcefield.</p>

<p>There’s also Rift Relics that can be retrieved from strange portals, which will feature overpowered weapons and Boost Kits to give you a real leg up in a match, and a new universal, character agnostic melee, the Raptor’s Claw. This can be unlocked through the Void Mercenary Store between now and 7th January,</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-mesh-shaders-4k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may support mesh shaders, judging from some recently datamined information that has been shared online this week.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/watertoon.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watertoon</a>, the code of the Nintendo Switch Online playtest, which was held in the past few days for a new unannounced game, reportedly features support for mesh shaders and 4K resolution, neither of them supported by the current console. Considering how the Japanese company's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a>, there's a very good chance that these features will be supported by the yet-to-be-revealed console.</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;<span>it being almost 2025, we are still relying on rumors to learn more about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like this could be going on for a little while longer. According to analysts, a reveal before January is unlikely, as Nintendo wouldn't want the announcement of an upcoming system to impact sales of the current console and its software, which haven't been doing too well</span>&nbsp;in the past quarter.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console is launching next year, but it has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has officially announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is in the works as part of the company's drive to revive some of its classic franchises.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to VGC</a>, Sega transmedia head Justin Scarpone revealed that alongside revivals of franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>,&nbsp;which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">announced during last year's Game Awards</a>, a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is also in development, although Scarpone stopped short of revealing further details.</p>

<p>Scarpone also says that "in certain instances", Sega has transmedia projects in development alongside its games, pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a> as an example, although it's not clear whether&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is also part of that initiative.</p>

<p>These projects include a reboot of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which Sega says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">will be an open-world MMO</a> in contrast to the original game's classic arcade approach to gameplay, as well as reworks of <i>Golden Axe</i>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>(in the latter case, a reboot distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">2020's&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>).</p>

<p>We don't have any kind of inclination regarding what exactly Sega is planning to do with these franchises (beyond the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot, of course), but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

The game managed to sell a million copies within its first few hours on sale.</p>

<p>The gaming giant has also enjoyed recent success thanks to the release of&nbsp;3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, which, much like the aforementioned JRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million">sold very strongly indeed on its launch day</a>.</p>

Fans love to see crazy story beats, especially when they result in unique fights or new characters. A great example of this is Gohan Black, a fun twist on the diabolical Goku Black. He’s become popular enough that everyone wants to play as him, although that’s easier said than done.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194972" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="135" data-playlist="194972,195064,197298" data-current="194972"><div><p>This Lesbian Mafia Anime Might Actually Make You Want To Play Golf</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194972/194972_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This what-if villain has his own story arc hidden behind a tough fight. It’s not as bad or confusing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">getting all of Jiren’s endings</a></span>, but I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve had trouble unlocking it. We’re going to lay out how to encounter him within Episode Battle as well as your options for playing the new villain yourself.</p><h2 id="h5095"><a id=""></a>Who is Gohan Black?</h2><p>Gohan Black is an original character for <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, although I’m sure there exists plenty of fanfics already out there based on the idea. If the name or my brief explanation above didn’t already give it away, <strong>Gohan Black is the product of a what-if story where Zamasu doesn’t switch bodies with Goku, but with his firstborn son instead</strong>.</p><p>Everyone has taken a strong liking to this neat twist and plenty have voiced their preference for Gohan as a villain over his dad. Of course, it’s not just the lore that’s left us all excited. Gohan Black is a surprisingly detailed inclusion for the game. While he does share a moveset with Goku Black, he comes with an exclusive portrait and his own voice acting. There is even more to show on the back end of things.</p><p>Within the story mode he doesn’t seem like a finished character since he only uses basic rush combos and vanish attacks. Data miners have discovered more work went into him than thought as he has voice work for all of his unused supers and skills. He even has a special battle introduction dialogue interaction against Goku, which would only be viewable in a versus mode.</p><p>I have no doubt that this would have been a popular what-if character on their own. It’s thanks to the above aspects, both what’s presented and found within the game’s files, that he’s managed to whip fans into a frenzy about playing him. Before we get to your options for doing that, let’s go over how to fight him in the story mode.</p><h2 id="h5096"><a id=""></a>How to Fight Gohan Black in Episode Battle</h2><figure id="" data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-recommend-id="image://f5a533a44c1fce1dcc5334d9eebcd0e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan’s Episode Battle map with his Defend Earth from the Frieza Force! mission highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Gohan Black is only fought through The Strongest Warrior story arc, which can be unlocked in Chapter 5 of Gohan’s Saga.</strong> To be more precise, you’ll need to complete the alternate objective in the “Defend Earth from the Frieza Force”<em> </em>mission, which simply reads as “Defeat the Frieza Force Soldier, then corner Frieza.”</p><p>That doesn’t tell you much, but I was able to clear it the same way most other alternate objectives are cleared: dealing a lot of damage as fast as I could. This can be a challenge since you have to fight against two enemies. I recommend charging your Ki whenever possible to enter the Sparking! Mode, that way you can get them caught in long rush combos and land your Ultimate Blast on them. Using Gohan’s Full Power Charge skill will also save time by instantly filling up your Ki gauge.</p><p>Don’t forget that lowering the difficulty will prevent you from completing an alternate objective. If you’re still having trouble finishing this fast enough, I recommend using a Dragon Orb to give yourself more time. These can be gained from wishes after you’ve summoned a dragon. This is a pretty tough battle, so it’s worth using them here.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-summoning-wishes-shenron-1851672547">Getting To Grips With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Wish-Granting Dragons</a></span></p><p>Getting through the fight quickly enough will lead you down The Strongest Warrior path, which starts with two more fights against Frieza. Defeating the space tyrant for good will cause Gohan to prioritize training more, leading him to catch the attention of Zamasu. This creates an altered version of the Future Trunks Arc highlighted by Gohan Black.</p><p>You’ll then be able to fight against the character that everyone wants. As mentioned earlier, he refrains from using any supers and just throws out rush combos and vanish attacks. That doesn’t mean he’s a pushover by any stretch of the imagination. Feel free to try out some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-battle-assist-guide-1851685568">Battle Assist settings</a></span> or even lower the difficulty if his combos keep melting your health bar. This story arc is a straight shot without any branching paths, so you won’t miss anything by taking it easy.</p><p>There are four more fights for the story after this, including one against Gohan Black in an Ultimate-like transformation that rivals Goku Black’s Rose Form. The last two fights are against Fused Zamasu, who now sports a long bang in front of his face just like Gohan. Beat every mission to unlock The Strongest Warrior achievement and finish this fun alternate scenario.</p><h2 id="h5097"><a id=""></a>How to Play as Gohan Black</h2><figure id="" data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-recommend-id="image://89ec992d77795f84b69b1dab9fcac30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gohan Black stares at the camera with a grimace during a cutscene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>If you’re looking to properly add Gohan Black to your roster, I’m sorry to say that currently isn’t an option.</strong> Some want him to be a separate character and others want him to be a special outfit for Goku Black since the two do share the same move set. Unfortunately, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have any hidden fighters to unlock, nor any unique cosmetics that overhaul a character.</p><p>That’s not to say Gohan Black couldn’t be made available later on down the road. All the unused voice lines and altered visual effects could go to waste if he was made playable as a separate character. Having him be a cosmetic for the character he’s based on would make the most sense. There is a small precedent for a character’s outfit affecting things too, with Android 18 and Goku (Super) having one each that changes one of their super attacks.</p><p>You do have a couple of “less official” methods if you play on PC. <strong>The first is likely what you expect: search online and find a mod that swaps out Goku Black for Gohan Black.</strong> Thanks to so many assets already available in the game, mods for this come off pretty seamlessly. Online opponents will just see regular Goku Black while you will see the edgy what-if character of your dreams.</p><p>The second method is a uniquely bizarre workaround that doesn’t require you to have any mods installed on your end. Modders have realized that if they load in non-playable character models that are already in the game’s files (such as for story or super cutscene purposes) and publish them through the Custom Battles feature, anyone who plays it will be able to use those same models. <strong>That means you can play Gohan Black on PC by searching through the Custom Battle feature and finding one with him in it.</strong></p><p>Gohan Black is arguably the most stable example of the wacky NPCs you can find. This is likely a testament to how “complete” he’s presented as. However, these battles don’t stay up long and are less likely to pop up in the future. Bandai Namco has been very upfront about the fact that those who upload modded Custom Battles <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1851449322375696669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be banned</a></span>. That shouldn’t threaten anyone playing them, but who knows exactly how they’ll handle this weird situation. I’d recommend looking for mods to be on the safe side. Most of these player-made battles are super difficult and against the strongest fighters in the game anyway.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> has a big roster filled with different <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">characters to unlock</a></span>, but it is lacking a few fan-favorites. Which is why it means a lot that so many are calling for an original character like this to be added. We know that the DLC announced so far will include fighters from <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em> and Dragon Ball Daima, but that isn’t going to stop anyone from hoping that Gohan Black is made officially playable through an update.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It expanded the geographic scope of the show by taking Will, Eleven, and Jonathan to California, while still doubling down on the 80s nostalgia, shadowy intrigue, and paranormal phenomena that first made the <em>Goonies</em>-esque kids adventure a hit back in 2016. There wasn’t originally supposed to be a fifth season, but series creators Matt and Ross Duffer later extended the show’s ambitions after it blew up.</p><p>Fans are already pouring over the new episode titles for clues about where the show will head next before ultimately wrapping things up. Since the episode titles seemingly leaked months ago, the confirmation today provides a pretty good idea of whose name is blurred in the episode 2 title, while “The Rightside Up” seems like a fitting note for the show to go out on. </p><p>Of course, in the modern entertainment landscape it’s hard to see any super-popular franchise truly ending. Besides the spin-offs in various stages of planning, I’ll bet there’s always the prospect of a reunion movie down the road. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, one of the company's executives confirmed that another classic Sega franchise will be punching its way back into the limelight, as a new Virtua Fighter has been confirmed to be in active development.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, Justin Scarpone--executive VP and head of Sega's Global Transmedia Group--confirmed the existence of a new Virtua Fighter alongside the other legacy Sega franchises mentioned previously. No other details on the upcoming project, or whether it will be part of a larger transmedia strategy--like Shinobi, another legacy IP, which has a game in development and a movie in production--were confirmed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395479"></a><figcaption>Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown (2021)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4395479-virtua-fighter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket, which we announced last year at The Game Awards," Scarpone said. "Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and we have another Virtua Fighter being developed. And so all that’s very exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming the new game is not a reboot or remake, the new Virtua Fighter would be the sixth entry in the fighting franchise, which ushered in a new era of 3D-based fighters when it debuted in 1993. The most recent game, Virtua Fighter 5, first launched for home consoles in 2007 before being remastered in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega's transmedia strategy began with the successful release of the Sonic The Hedgehog movie in 2020--with the third film in that series set for release next month. Other recent Sega releases include the Yakuza: Like A Dragon series on Amazon Prime Video, Sonic X Shadow Generations on consoles and PC, and Metaphor: ReFantazio from the Atlus wing of the company.</p>

			<p>A new entry in the Virtua Fighter series has finally been confirmed to be in the works today.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a> about bringing back classic SEGA franchises like Shinobi and Set Radio across games, movies, and TV, global head of transmedia Justin Scarpone casually confirmed that a new entry in the fighting game series that has been left dormant for years is in development. While nothing else was added about the game, it is very nice to know that the series is about to make a grand comeback.</p>
<p>While welcome, the confirmation of a new Virtua Fighter game currently being in development is hardly surprising, as SEGA somewhat brought the franchise back with Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, an enhanced remake of the fifth entry in the series, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2021. The game bested the publisher's expectations, who did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-successful-future-games-considered/">future plans for the series</a>, which are coming to fruition with the newly announced game, rumored to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-reboot-details/">reboot</a> launching on all major platforms complete with cross-platform play support and rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest entry in the series, Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, on its <a href="https://virtuafighter5us.sega.com/lang/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

<p>You know, I’m a total sucker for Stardew Valley. I grew up playing cutesy farming sim games, like the original Harvest Moon titles, and that love stuck with me despite my gaming tastes becoming more mature. It’s easy to love the indie farming hit, as developer ConcernedApe continuously updates and improves the core experience. Now, we’re treated to the latest Stardew Valley console update—update 1.6—and it’s enormous!</p>



<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-update-1-6-patch-notes">Stardew Valley Update 1.6 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Prepare yourself because this is a positively huge update that touches upon most aspects of gameplay, including festivals, an all-new farm type, the ability to acquire multiple pets, a world map for Ginger Island, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, better mod support, and so much more. It enhances Stardew Valley on consoles tenfold!</p>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Price changes:

<li>Friendship gain is reduced by 33% for spouses.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Rebalanced the&nbsp;crop fairy&nbsp;event: the chance no longer depends on the number of planted crops, it can no longer happen on the last day of the season (to avoid growing crops that might die overnight), and it can no longer choose dead crops to grow.</li>

<li>Randomization no longer produces simple repeating patterns in many cases (e.g. clay farming, mushroom level prediction, crab pot fish offset, etc).(You can enable “Use Legacy Randomization” in the&nbsp;advanced save options&nbsp;to use the old randomization, though some specific patterns may still change due to the underlying changes. That option is mainly intended for speedrunners; most players should keep it disabled for the intended experience.)</li>



<li>Spreading&nbsp;weeds&nbsp;can no longer destroy&nbsp;artifact spots.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/if-sony-ever-gave-a-diablo-style-bloodborne-spin-off-the-green-light-it-might-look-something-like-this<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan-made top-down action RPG take on Bloodborne has given fans a clear picture of what a Diablo-style spin-off might look like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxime Foulquier</a>, who had ditched plans to remake Bloodborne in Unreal Engine 5 out of fear of a cease and desist from franchise owner Sony, has now started a new project called ‘Bloodborne Top Down Arena,’ and in the tweet below, showed gameplay off.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS! I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena</p><p>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it 😂 <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>— Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks very much as you’d expect: FromSoftware’s hugely popular Bloodborne but with the camera pulled up into an action RPG perspective. The repurposed Bloodborne combat is action RPG snappy, perhaps a good fit for a Diablo-style game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foulquier <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Bloodborne Top Down Arena is "less ambitious and different from a true remake” of Bloodborne, so hopes it will avoid falling into the crosshairs of Sony’s lawyers. “The Demake and the Minecraft Project didn't receive CnD so I cross the fingers,” Foulquier added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the developer behind Bloodborne Nightmare Kart <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">ended up re-jipping the game after Sony got in touch</a>, so perhaps Foulquier is being a little naive here. Foulquier insisted, however, that because Bloodborne Top Down Arena is not planned for release on Steam, it will avoid a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah but I don't want to release this on Steam.</p>— Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1854087594008617080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what Bloodborne fans really want is a sequel to the PS4 classic, or, saving that, a next-gen update for the original game. Neither are so far announced from either FromSoftware or Sony. In February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that because the developer doesn’t own the Bloodborne IP</a>, he can’t speak about its future. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">IGN has had a look at Bloodborne running on the PS5 Pro</a>, which launches November 7 priced $700. And then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-bloodborne-remake-but-there-is-a-bloodborne-outfit-for-astro-bot">the Bloodborne cameo in recently released PS5 exclusive Astro Bot</a>, if you’re desperate for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-has-a-secret-mew-card-thats-not-super-difficult-to-get<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gotta collect 'em all.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> contains a secret, full art Mew card and continues the long-running tradition of only letting players grab the mythical pocket monster by completing some interesting quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mew card, which is part of the Genetic Apex set but comes unnumbered due to its status as an alternate art card (despite there not actually being a regular version), can only be obtained after players complete the Kanto Pokédex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players must acquire the first 150 Pokémon from the original Red and Blue generation, meaning everything from Bulbasaur to Pikachu to Dragonite to Mewtwo. Once players have collected one of each of these Pokémon the 3 Star Mew card will unlock.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/mew-1730901811705.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3 Star Mew card in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only condition is the cards must also be from Genetic Apex, meaning, for example, that collecting the promotional Butterfree card from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">the special Lapras ex event</a> won't count towards the 150 total despite it being among the first 150 Pokémon. Any version of the Pokémon from Genetic Apex will work, however, whether it's an ex or alternative art or regular or whatever else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While simple, collecting so many cards may still take some time. One player recently worked out it could take almost two years of daily play to collect every card in the set, though thankfully hitting the 150 necessary for Mew will require considerably less time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mew holds a special place in the set as one of just four 3 Star cards, meaning it's one of the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork. It joins Charizard, Pikachu, and Mewtwo in this category, the three Pokémon which feature on the booster pack covers of Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.
