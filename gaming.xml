			<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director is reportedly leaving BioWare after having worked on the game since February 2022.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>reliable journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported</a></span>, Corinne Busche will depart the team responsible for so many excellent role-playing games in the coming weeks. The studio, on the other hand, will not be affected by any other changes. According to Eurogamer, the game's performance on the market did not affect this departure.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely did have an easy development. The new entry in the celebrated series has been in the works for over ten years and went through a few development reboots before finally releasing last year. Despite all the development troubles, the game turned out well, as Alessio highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, but sales likely haven't been stellar, as both BioWare and EA have not commented on them since launch.</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Apart from the Steam Deck, FF 7 Rebirth PC will be best experienced on a desktop where you can take advantage of enhanced features such as 120fps, refined lighting, improved environment detail, and more detailed textures. Depending on your setup, you can also benefit from improved framerates and image quality with NVIDIA DLSS.

            <p>
Japanese police have arrested a man accused of modifying and selling Nintendo Switch consoles.
</p>
<p>
It's the first time someone under suspicion of breaking the country's Trademark Act by handling modded Switch consoles has been arrested, <a href="https://news.ntv.co.jp/n/rkc/category/society/rcc5bf23d3d9bd40b5bc4da1bb34648d49">NTV News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-man-arrested-for-selling-modded-nintendo-switch-consoles-setting-a-new-precedent/">Automaton</a>) reports, potentially setting a new, harsher precedent for the future.
</p>
<p>
The 58-year-old suspect is believed to have made a business out of modifying second-hand Switch consoles so that they play pirated games, and reselling these modded units for 28,000 yen (about £150) apiece.

<p>
The man, who has reportedly admitted to the charge, also offered a bundle of 27 pirated games to play on the modded consoles for an additional fee.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes just days after the deputy general manager of Nintendo's Japanese intellectual property department said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">the company was beefing up its stance against illegal emulation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is of course no stranger to legal action when it feels its products are under threat, and has made an example out of individuals in the past.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyer pressed to ensure the maximum five-year jail time was handed down to the infamous Gary Bowser</a> - who worked as part of another business that enabled Switch piracy - as it would be "a large benefit to further education of the public".
</p><p>
Speaking last year, Bowser - now freed from prison but in financial debt to Nintendo due to fines for the rest of his working life - said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-says-nintendo-wanted-to-send-a-message-with-sentence">his sentence had been designed like a message</a> "to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught ... [they'll] serve hard time".

            <p>Director and writer David Lynch, known for his surreal work across film and television, has passed away at the age of 78.</p>
<p>Announcing his death on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#">Facebook</a> yesterday, Lynch's family wrote: "It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole'. It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way."</p>
<p>While Lynch is best known for his work on TV series such as Twin Peaks and films like Mulholland Drive, the creator is also a memorable part of PlayStation's history, responsible for several iconic PS2 adverts which arrived with that unmistakable Lynchian brand of surrealism and shades of neo-noir.</p>

<p>The most famous of these adverts is the brilliantly bonkers black-and-white affair known as Welcome To The Third Space. Kicking off with a wailing siren, a voice asks through a speaker: "Where are we?" A man walks through a corridor, his head detaches from his body, it reattaches, an arm comes out from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Third Place," quacks a suited duck. </p>
<p>The iconic trailer was shared by <a href="https://x.com/PlayStationAU/status/1880104053184811213">PlayStation Australia</a> in the early hours of this morning. "RIP David Lynch," PlayStation AU wrote. You can experience the trailer once again in the video above.</p>

<p>Posting on social media last night, Remedy boss and Alan Wake writer Sam Lake shared his sadness at Lynch's passing. "David Lynch has been a huge inspiration to me and a huge influence on my work," he wrote. "Rest in peace."</p>
<p>In a separate post, Lake revealed that Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> team had used the code name "Big Fish" for its surreal sequel, a nod to Lynch's autobiography and self-help guide Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.</p>
<p>"I think David Lynch is swimming with the big fish now," Lake shared with an image of the book. "His influence goes far and wide and will live on."</p>

<p>Fallout actor <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE5pC5RyH29/?img_index=1">Kyle Maclachlan</a> also shared some words about the director, who he said "plucked [him] out of obscurity". Maclachlan worked with Lynch on a number of projects, including Twin Peaks.</p>
<p>"He clearly saw something in me that even I didn't recognise. I owe my entire career, and life really, to his vision," Maclachlan wrote. "I will miss him more than the limits of my language can tell and my heart can bear. My world is that much fuller because I knew him and that much emptier now that he's gone.</p>
<p>"David, I remain forever changed, and forever your Kale. Thank you for everything."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s not even been a full day since the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, and the pre-order sign-ups have already started popping up for the upcoming console. Best Buy was the first to join the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a>, you will see a new sign-up page for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders if you go to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c?id=pcmcat1736965129196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy’s website</a> right now. However, the signup doesn’t confirm the pre-order for you; instead, it sends out notifications when pre-orders go live, announcements regarding games for the upcoming console are released and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details such as pricing or availability have not been provided on Best Buy’s Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order sign-up page, as the company has yet to release that information. However, Nintendo will reveal the pricing, release date, games arriving for the console, and the device’s capabilities during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Direct event</a> for the Switch 2 on April 2, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, only the console and some of its functionality have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The Switch 2 will feature a larger console and joy-cons that snap to the device now instead of sliding in. The console’s colour has changed too, with the company going for an all-black casing with red and blue accents. Players can also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-experience-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on experience</a> with the highly anticipated Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hype for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been unreal, so much so that analysts have already claimed that the new console will sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-20-million-sales-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 million units</a> in the first year. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s a guide</a> on all the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks, rumours and other information.

            <p>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God Of War</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">a report</a> by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a> remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The natural worry here is that the decision will lead to layoffs. Sony confirmed the cancellations, saying they took place after an internal "review". However they wouldn't commit to an answer about employee job security, saying only that they didn't intend to close the studios. Meanwhile, a memo was sent in an effort to reassure staff, letting them know PlayStation would try to "ensure there is minimal business impact". The company would be working with the studios to figure out what they'll be working on next, PlayStation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfrztbks25">told Bloomberg</a>. </p>
<p>"Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family," they said in a statement to Bloomberg, "and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects."</p>
<p>Ominous. We didn't hear much talk about the God Of War game before now. But we knew something was afoot at Bend when they began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">hiring for staff with experience making blockbuster live service games</a>. Even at the time it seemed unusual for this single player studio to pivot to live service, but this is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">general trend chased by Sony</a> since 2022, albeit one they seem to be abandoning of late. The company have cancelled a few other live service projects in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">a multiplayer game based on The Last Of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">a co-op Spiderman</a> game. </p><p>Cancellations are fairly common in the industry, so arguably this is not that unusual. But it does look like the fear has truly been injected into Sony by hydraulic needle following the fate of online hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, a flop estimated to have cost the company at least $200 million, with the real cost likely being higher than that. That includes the human cost of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">all the workers who lost their jobs</a> when the studio was shuttered as a result.</p>
<p>Live service is an interesting monster in the grander ecosystem of videos gamesing. Huge corporations are attracted to the model thanks to certain heavy hitters like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> retaining a magical dollar-shitting ability for years and years and years. But they can be massively attention-demanding for the average player - how many of this type of game can you really play on the reg? My feelings about games-as-a-service is broadly in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">Edwin's recent eloquent scribblethoughts</a>. Here's a good part of that: </p>
<blockquote>Even before they became ubiquitous, live service games felt like a burden. They are inherently exhausting to think about. The business model is the experience in a way that it isn't for anything you "buy once" and theoretically enjoy in your "own time", away from the sludgepumps of commerce - it breaks the golden rule that art created under capitalism should at least feel like it's an escape from capitalism, by forcing you to think of playing as an on-going interaction with an evolving product.</blockquote>

            <p>Nintendo's share price has dropped in the wake of the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about">"safe" debut</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/17/nintendo-shares-tumble-as-switch-2-reveal-disappoints-fans">Al Jazeera</a>, stocks fell by as much as 7.2 percent after the hardware's formal announcement. Prices did bounce back a little, but by 4pm local time, share prices were still down 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>That said, since the end of last year, Nintendo's share price <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1">has been so strong</a>, the Japanese firm's stock value still sits on a near all-time high.</p>

<p>Whilst many factors contribute to a company's share price - and we still don't yet know all the technical specifications - it's widely speculated that due to the furore generated by the rumours over many weeks and months and the perceived lack of innovation between the two generations of hardware, the reception to Switch 2's debut from some quarters was somewhat flat.</p>

            <p>After eons of waiting, Nintendo has <em>finally </em>debuted its next console. Yes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> - as we can now call it officially - was revealed yesterday, with a brief teaser video full of magnetic Joy-Cons and some really rather yummy noises.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer have our own thoughts on Nintendo's reveal (be sure to check out Bertie's feature<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about"> If Switch 2 is the end of innovative Nintendo, there's much to be sad about</a> and Donlan's one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-the-switch-2-is-safe-then-im-jason-statham-and-i-want-to-star-in-it">If the Switch 2 is safe, then I'm Jason Statham and I want to star in it</a>, for two sides of the discussion).</p>
<p>But, what of those outside of the EG walls? Well, several have jumped on the Switch 2 train and shared their thoughts, even sausage roll bakery chain Greggs.</p>

            <p>Superheroes often conceal their identities behind masks, capes and in my case, a pungent snood-and-hoodtop combo that makes me look like I've crawled out of a drain. No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out <em>some</em> of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play. </p><!--more-->
<p>Well, get ready to be unmasked, you awful sneaks, because developers NetEase are planning to crack down on this duplicitous practice. If they catch you faking a pair of analogue sticks, they might even suspend your account.</p>
<p>"We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse," explains <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html">a post on the game's forums</a>. "This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features. Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter."</p>
<p>Perhaps you think you can slip the strong grasp of Justice by means of ratlike cunning. Fool! Ratlike cunning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin">the exclusive preserve of journalists</a>. And besides, NetEase "have forged a strong detection tool" which they will "couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters."</p><p>I know that it's written in character, but I'm slightly alarmed that NetEase feel it necessary to specify that their eyes are human. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Perhaps everybody in the office is an Ultron clone, and banning mouse and keyboard adaptors is all part of some globe-toppling Master Plan.</p>
<p>Even if it is, I can't argue with the point that tricksy M&amp;K bolt-ons give some users an unsporting edge. "We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players," the NetEase post continues. "Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be very popular. And chaotic, given that the entire cast are superheroes. This is a game in which everybody needs to feel like they could dominate. I don't envy the devs trying to distinguish the superpowered from the overpowered, let alone flush out the cheaters. If you missed it earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">they're planning to add two new characters a season</a>, so the balancing is only going to get more complicated from here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Allow me to explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved. That was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</a>, although there are still a number of burning questions we have about the next-gen console. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the point where the Hollow Knight community went into overdrive — or off the deep end, depending on your point of view. Fans reverse-searched the picture of the cake, which led them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bon Appétit</a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/screenshot-2025-01-17-094610-1737107179081.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Is the cake a lie? Image credit: <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake">Bon Appétit.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why would that date be important here? Because Nintendo has confirmed Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 will air on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. That’s right, fans think Pellen has kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG) with that tweet and that picture of the cake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans haven’t stopped there. They’re currently trying to work out what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, means, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Representative-True has the best theory I’ve seen so far</a>: “The character limit on Twitter handles is 15 characters, which is the length of ‘everydruidwaswr.’ I think “wr” is likely the start of a word, like wrong or something. I have yet to decipher this, but the Druid of the Moss Temple is a Silksong NPC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens! Pellen has a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: little bomey. What’s that about? Fans have noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. What could it mean?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</a>, Team Cherry confirmed launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. Has Nintendo snapped up Hollow Knight: Silksong as a Switch 2 launch title? Is it a timed exclusive? Is this all just bonkers behavior from information-starved fans?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a few months to find out. In the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed">everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-kingdom-come-dynasty-warriors-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been starting 2025 with a bout of flu – thanks, 2025 – but on the plus side that’s meant I’ve been tucked up in bed with my ROG Ally, Balatro, and the end of Metaphor ReFantazio. These are all good things. Other than that, I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> (Microsoft’s cloud streaming for this is impeccable), some Kingdom Come: Deliverance to see what it’s all about, and a tiny bit of Marvel Rivals too. Life could be worse, in other words.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? <strong>Aran</strong> played Space Marine, the first one, as it’s been in his backlog forever. He told us, “It’s a nice throwback to the PS3 and 360 era of third-person shooters with obvious heavy influence from Gears of War. I was also surprised to see that the online was still quite active. I’ve also been playing more Witcher 3 and have just landed on Skellige.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been hopelessly glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> which he says is easily the best game in the series to date. Giving us some detail, he said, “After the mess that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">DW9</a> I honestly didn’t have much hope for the series, but somehow Omega Force has managed the impossible. Although there was a cathartic joy in mindlessly hammering out button combos, Origins offers a genuine test of skill and a wealth of content I’m actually eager to explore and replay. Hopefully its glowing critical reception will translate into commercial success, cementing a sequel, and an “Origins” style shake-up for Samurai Warriors.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the System Shock remake, which he says “could have done with a bit more remaking, I get it’s a classic game but it just feels so dated.” He hasn’t really enjoyed much gaming this week, to be honest, saying, “I also played The Stanley Parable and I am going to be a grumpy old man and say I didn’t think much of it at all, the narrator started getting on my tits mansplaining everything. I also played Suicide Squad (spot the theme here?) which I didn’t get past the Shark guy tutorial because it was so fricking dull, it felt like someone had tried to make Destiny by committee. I also played the new Destiny 2 episode which wasn’t particularly great either. I do have LEGO Horizon sat on my table so I’m hoping that will save the week.” Let us know if it’s saved the day TC!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for review next month, Cuisineer also for review, and a bit of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer for not review. That’s not all, but much like TC, the further gaming hasn’t been all that enjoyable – “I’ve also been playing Veilguard, which is about fifteen layers of disappointment. It feels shallow, dialogue is poor, a main character’s voice can’t pull off the role, I can’t explore during actual missions without hitting twenty dead ends I have to come back to later. The only thing it almost excels at is graphics, but even then the generic aesthetic where even Qunari don’t look particularly alien anymore is just shite.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has only been playing Marvel Rivals, hammering away at the season pass and getting reasonably good with Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon. He says, “I’m loving the new additions to the game with Season 1 and looking forward to seeing what the second half of the season brings.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through the first Gears of War on Series S (360 rather than remaster) as he fancied actually playing the series through (previously only played the remaster of 1 on PC). What did he think? “It was fun but hasn’t aged that well. Started the second one now which feels like a pretty big leap forwards. I’ve reinstalled Another Crab’s Treasure after getting distracted and completely forgetting what I was doing in it and it is still one of the best Souls-likes out there. Not resorted to using the gun yet but leaving it open as an option if I get super stuck. Picked up Blade Chimera on Steam (cheaper if you already own Bloodstained) as that’s been on my radar for a long while.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>. He dabbled with a little bit of the original Space Marine, similar to Aran dragging it out of his backlog, stomped through the opening level of RoboCop: Rogue City (which he previously played for preview), and played something secret and shadowy that he’ll talk about next week. He’s also just about to start playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> and a roguelike Tetris kind of thing called Drop Duchy.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

        <p>After 18-year career at EA.</p>

Corinne Busche, who served as game director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> since February 2022, is departing BioWare. 
</p>
<p>
Whispers of her exit began circulating online last night, and were first confirmed by journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790">Jeff Grubb</a>. Eurogamer can also confirm Busche will depart BioWare in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands BioWare itself is otherwise unaffected by any other changes, contrary to rumour.

</figure>
<p>
Busche, working closely alongside creative director John Epler, helped oversee The Veilguard's final stretch of development from early 2022 onwards, until its final release last October. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard slogged through a mammoth decade-long development and several reboots before the version we finally saw launch arrived, steered by Busche.
</p>
<p>
Critically, The Veilguard has been received well, and commercially sales have been decent - but there's also been a suggestion that sales have not exceeded expectations. Still, Eurogamer understands The Veilguard's commercial performance was not a direct factor in Busche's departure. 
</p><p>
Alongside her work on The Veilguard, Busche has served as a designer and design director within publisher EA for 18 years, working on numerous entries in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and The Sims Mobile.
</p>
<p>
Post Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">bulk of BioWare is now turning its attention fully to the next Mass Effect game</a>, which is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">led by a separate small team of veterans</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke with both Busche and Epler in December for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">our big Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-release interview</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations," Epler said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, tech insider website The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella faced a difficult choice in 2021 regarding the Xbox business. He could either wind down the whole thing or double down by making massive investments, such as the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (following that of Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax).</p>
<p>He obviously chose the latter option. However, The Information makes the case that the gaming business is failing to keep up with Microsoft's growth plans despite these investments, starting with the fact that they didn't even come close to reaching the 11% target necessary to trigger Nadella's bonus, since growth stopped at 5.8%. It was the only division that fell short of reaching the bonus threshold for the Microsoft CEO.</p>
<p>The Information also shared a few comments on the situation gathered from investors and analysts. Denny Fish, a Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager whose clients own over $800 million in Microsoft stock, said that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has been disappointing so far.</p>
<p><em>It’s also a business that had some degree of consistency over, like, a three- to five-year period but was highly volatile from year to year, because you’re so dependent on the big releases like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did very well this year</a>, though the jury is still out on whether its day-one inclusion on Game Pass was beneficial from a financial standpoint. Despite the boasting about record numbers, Microsoft did not reveal any updated figures for Game Pass subscriptions. The last official number we have is February 2024's 34 million subscribers. As a reminder, the original plan before the Activision buyout was to reach 100 million active subscribers by 2030.</p>
<p>This was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Pachter's prediction</a> for when the Activision titles would be added to Game Pass. Most of them are there now, though, and clearly, the numbers aren't anywhere near that lofty figure. Pachter still sounds confident in the plan, anyway. Here's what he told The Information:</p>
<p><em>Seventy billion dollars is not a pittance—it’s a lot of cash. They might lose money in the short term, which is fine, as long as they can prove that in the long run Game Pass is a solid source of recurring revenue.</em></p>
<p>Another investment manager, Gus Zinn from Macquarie Science and Technology Fund, has a different view:</p>
<p><em>I just think the majority of the game market doesn’t really want a Game Pass.</em></p>
<p>There are highly conflicting views on Microsoft's game subscription service. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-sales-higher-rockfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely swear by it</a>, while others are skeptical, to say the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to former GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring</a>, developers can usually expect to lose up to 80% of premium sales on Xbox consoles if their game is on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Anyway, a Microsoft spokesperson has now denied the aforementioned rumor that Satya Nadella could have shut down Xbox a few years back. In a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Insider Gaming</a>, they have noted Microsoft CEO's prior comments about being <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-were-all-in-on-games-xbox-series-sx-are-our-fastest-selling-consoles-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-in on gaming</a>.</p>
<p>On another, not entirely unrelated note, Microsoft has cut some jobs in gaming as well as other divisions (security, devices, experiences), as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-lays-off-more-staff-in-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by PC Mag</a>. The cuts are reportedly very small compared to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive 1900+ layoffs in January</a>.</p>

            <p>Trading will be added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company teased the feature at the game's launch - it's been right there, "coming soon", since the app launched - but finally we have more information about which cards will be tradeable.</p>
<p>Firstly, trades can only be done between friends and only with cards of the same rarity. So no swapping one of those millions of Ponyta for a shiny Mewtwo.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also stated that only certain cards from both the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be available to trade. "We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from," it said.</p>
<p>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1 star can be traded. This excludes both Ex cards (generally the rarest of all) and Promo cards found in events.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hello! Here is a statement from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team highlighting the details of the upcoming trade feature and new content coming to the game.</p><p>The team plans to diligently assess how trading will impact the player experience and the game once it is available. <a href="https://t.co/SVBRxIN6sP">pic.twitter.com/SVBRxIN6sP</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Lastly, an item will need to be consumed in order to trade, presumably to stop the feature being overused (and surely provides another monetisation opportunity).</p>
<p>"We'll continue to monitor player feedback and assess future updates to the trade feature while keeping in mind how to balance both the ease and enjoyability of collecting," The Pokémon Company said.</p>
<p>Further, the statement confirms the next booster pack will also be added this month, though no more details were given.</p>
<p>The last booster pack was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mew-headlines-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-booster-packs">Mythical Island pack</a>, headlined by Mew, that was released in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>As unannounced projects, we don’t know for sure what either team was working on, though <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/15/seasons-greetings-2022-playstation-blog-and-friends/">Bluepoint teased something God of War related</a> in Christmas well-wishes from 2022. Bend Studio</p>
<p>There’s obviously the potential for job losses as a consequence of this, and it’s not clear if these were the only projects that either studio was working on, but in an internal memo that Bloomberg has seen, Sony said that it’s “working closely with Bend and Bluepoint to determine what are the next projects and plan to do everything we can to ensure there is minimal business impact.”</p>

<p>It’s the latest embarrassing fumble from Sony in what will go down as one of the worst games industry pivots in recent memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/02/ps5-10-live-service-games-march-2026-last-of-us-guerrilla-bungie-london-studio/">Announced in 2022 to investors</a>, Sony had plans to launch 12 live service games by 2026, and while there have been some success stories, like last year’s breakout hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or the bankable popularity of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a> (which can be considered a live service game here), there’s been far more ignominious failures.</p>
<p>The biggest flop by far was obviously <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> last year, which made it to release but was almost immediately pulled and shut down, with Firewalk Studios shut down a couple months later. That followed the closure of London Studios, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/28/london-studio-is-making-a-fantasy-online-co-op-game-for-ps5/">reportedly working on a fantasy online co-op game</a>, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">canning their The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, Firesprite’s Twisted Metal live service game being <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762503092593999913?s=46">canned while in pre-production</a>, shutting down <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/09/deviation-games-has-shut-down/">Deviation Games</a>, and seeing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">major struggles for Bungie</a> as they try to broaden their scope from the end of Destiny 2’s main narrative to releasing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Some live service projects are still underway, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/haven-studios-fairgame-playstation-exlcusive/">Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s studio Haven</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Horizon MMORPG</a>, an unknown live service game from Jason Blundell (who was previously at Deviation), and a game called Gummy Bears, which was spun out from Bungie last August.</p>
<p>Games are cancelled and pivoted all the time, but having announced their plans for so many live service games and an intention to latch onto the consistent revenue streams that they can provide, this has become a consistent failure point from Sony. We’re glad that there’s no layoffs right now, but unless Bend Studio (whose last game was 2019’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/days-gone-review/">Days Gone</a>) and Bluepoint Games (whose last game was the 2020 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/demons-souls-review-ps5/">Demon’s Souls</a> remake) can be pushed onto other projects, job losses and studio closures could follow.</p>

<p>Call of Duty’s pro scene isn’t in a good place. From lengthy gaps between stages to Black Ops 6 being in a pit thanks to cheaters, the Call of Duty League isn’t all that appealing right now. That’s a huge sticking point for both fans and pro players, most of whom rely on COD’s competitive ecosystem to make a living.</p>



<p>To support the floundering esports scene, Vegas Falcons, which entered the CDL this season, has stood up a Respawn 8s tournament with a sizeable cash prize to keep the content flowing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-on-top">Falcons on Top</h2>



<p>Despite being at the bottom of the CDL standings, the Vegas Falcons are trying their darndest to help the scene out as much as possible. One of the biggest issues in the Call of Duty esports ecosystem is the lack of content. Outside of the CDL, there’s not much to watch, leaving the scene’s brands and creators to organise tournaments and events.</p>



<p>And the less said about Warzone, the better. It’s in a shocker of a spot right now.</p>



<p>Today, the Vegas Falcons revealed a $10,000 Respawn 8s tournament, set to run from today through the weekend (17 – 26 Jan). On <a href="https://x.com/VegasFalcons/status/1880057467968934354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the organisation wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the Vegas Falcons Ladder</p>



<p>A pick-up game initiative designed to bring together the best talent to fight for $10,000 over 10 days. </p>



<p>Who will be crowned king ahead of Major I?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Major I is the most highly anticipated event of the CDL season thus far. It’s taking place in Madrid between January 30 and February 2, marking the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history. After that, things return stateside for Major II, which will take place in Texas, and then Major III, set to surface in Florida in April.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s fair that organisations have to scrape together to arrange events just to keep the fans switched on? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, there's only one story in town: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo's long-awaited unveiling of Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>Today's video laid out the bare bones of Switch 2, and it looked exactly as expected: like a slightly-larger Switch with an extra button and mysterious optical sensors. We also got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">very brief look at a new Mario Kart</a>, which looks... like a Mario Kart game. If anything, today's video only prompted more questions.</p>
<p>What will Mario Kart 9's main new feature be? Today's gameplay snippet - while brief - offered up a couple of intriguing clues. And when will Switch 2 actually arrive? Well, between the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">proper Nintendo Direct in April</a> and the console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">upcoming public hands-on tour</a>, we think there's a relatively narrow window. Joining me this week to discuss everything we saw - as well as what we're still waiting to hear about - are Ed Nightinale and Victoria Kennedy.</p>

            <p>Sony has cancelled two more of its once-envisioned live service Playstation projects.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled. And now, two more live service games have been added to that list.</p>

</figure>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">Bloomberg</a> now reveals two further live service games - one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint - have been cancelled by PlayStation following a "recent review".</p>
<p>The company did not say whether these cancellations will lead to any layoffs, however it said neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down. "Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects," a spokesperson told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a memo sent to staff stated Sony was going to do "everything" it can to "ensure there is minimal business impact" following the recent cancellations. In the meantime, PlayStation will continue making both online and single-player games.</p>
<p>As for what the impacted studios were working on, according to reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e">Jason Schrier</a>, Bluepoint was developing a live service game within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Bend, meanwhile, revealed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-new-ip-builds-upon-the-open-world-systems-of-days-gone">working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone"</a> back in 2022. In March of last year, a recruitment advert was posted to the studio's website, which revealed the team was looking to secure a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-next-project-will-be-a-aaa-live-service-game">lead project manager with "hands on game development experience in leadership roles shipping AAA live-service games"</a>.</p>

<p>Today's news that Sony has cancelled two more live service projects sees PlayStation stepping further back from those lofty plans it shared just a few years ago. While the company has had a success story in the shape of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - which released last year and quickly became a hit - others have not fared so well.</p><p>Most prominently, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a>. In March of last year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>
<p>While some live service projects still remain in the pipeline, in 2023, it was said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable"</a> about outgoing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's pivot to games as a service.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Friends, another soul is departing the RPS treehouse today. Ed has decided to lay down the mantle of reviews editor and rejoin polite society. Come join me in saying goodbye.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ed started at RPS back in 2020. He had been working on Metabomb, another site operated by RPS's then-owners which was closing down. We already knew how good a writer Edders, as we call him, was at that point - and what a lovely man, from chatting around the office - so we grabbed hold of him with both hands and didn't let go.
</p>
<p>You ought to know Ed's work by now. He's been reviews editor around these parts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/say-hello-and-welcome-to-our-new-reviews-editor-ed-thorn">for around 18 months</a>, but he was a senior staff writer for over two years before that. He <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-plant-carrots-in-valheim">obsessed over Valheim carrots</a>, mused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-ark-is-the-mmo-equivalent-of-grey-carpet">grey carpets</a>, and explained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-of-war-and-badminton-have-more-in-common-than-you-might-think">how badminton and Gears Of War were alike</a>. That last one is a favourite of mine, as is Ed's similar piece on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-two-years-kento-momota-had-the-best-game-in-the-world">his favourite badminton player retiring</a>.

<p>As reviews editor, Ed's been responsible for wrangling code from developers and words from the team and from freelancers, which is no mean feat. He's also written a cavalcade of excellent reviews himself. I'm most fond of his take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-chan-shiro-and-the-coal-town-review">Shin-chan: Shiro And The Coal Town late last year</a>, which drew on his personal history with Japan, or his frequent, breathless writing about his love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review">various</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Yakuza</a> games.
</p>
<p>You should also check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-oblivion-feeling">Ed's own reflections on his departure in a separate article</a>. It's a good trip down memory lane, at least for those of us who work here.</p>
<p>We've had more goodbyes than welcomes at RPS of late, but that should change in the months to come as we'll be hiring for a new reviews editor. Yet there will only ever be one Reviews Edders. Join me in wishing Ed an RPS In Peace in the comments below.

Now, Schreier says the studios won’t close, but there’s no word yet on what their next projects will be. </p><p>The live service approach to gaming once seemed wide open following the success of <em>Fortnite </em>and other titles, but games like <em>Concord</em>, <em>Anthem</em>, and <em>Redfall </em>have shown how difficult it can be. At Sony alone, the list of canceled service titles <em>Bloomberg </em>has already reported on included the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">Spider-Man game</a> revealed by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">Insomniac ransomware breach</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/sony-cuts-900-jobs-in-gaming-shuts-down-london-division"><em>Twisted Metal</em></a>, and a Destiny-linked game <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff">from Bungie</a> called <em>Payback. </em></p><p>However, we’re still expecting to hear more about Bungie’s revived <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter"><em>Marathon</em></a><em> </em>extraction shooter and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23732791/fairgames-playstation-showcase-ps5-sony-haven-studios"><em>Fairgames</em></a>, a PvP heist title from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989187/sony-playstation-haven-studios-acquisition-jade-raymond-new-multiplayer-game">Haven Studios</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Schreier</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sony spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to Bloomberg. Sony also added that neither studios will be closed and that they will work with them "to determine what are the next projects," from the two studios will be. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is another blow to Sony's ambitious live-service game plans. In 2022, Sony acquired Destiny 2 developer Bungie and announced plans to have 12 live-service games running by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. Those plans have failed to materialize after Sony revised that number <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">down to just six</a>, of which Bend and Bluepoint's games were likely two of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also closed down Concord developer Firewalk Studio, oversaw layoffs at Bungie, and canceled numerous online projects like Naughty Dogs' The Last of Us PvP game, a rumored Spider-Man online game, a live-service Twisted Metal game, and a third-person Destiny spinoff titled Payback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leaves just Bungie's Marathon and Haven Studios' PvP project still in the works, alongside continued support for Helldivers 2 which Sony is publishing. There are also rumors of two online Horizon games, one co-op experience and another being an MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear now that Sony seems to be rethinking its live-service strategy, but whether that means backing online projects it believes will succeed or abandoning the space altogether remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games announced today that the company will be launching “in-game fundraisers” in VALORANT and League of Legends to support relief for the wildfires affecting the city of Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/la-wildfire-fundraiser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot says</a> the fundraisers will go live next week, and are part of several initiatives that the company has undertaken to aid the city it’s based in.</p>



<p>The wildfires in Los Angeles started earlier this month, destroying hundreds of homes and doing billions in damage.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-chance-for-valorant-and-league-players-to-do-some-good">A Chance For VALORANT and League Players to Do Some Good</h2>



<p>Beginning January 22nd, the latest EX.O skin collection in VALORANT will be converted to a Give Back Bundle. Proceeds from the bundle items will go directly to the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are/social-impact/social-impact-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games Social Impact Fund</a>. VALORANT has featured a Give Back Bundle, featuring fan-voted skins from other collections, every year since the game’s release. In previous iterations, 50 percent of skin proceeds and 100 percent of accessory proceeds are sent to the Fund. The EX.O bundle will leave the store on January 30th.</p>



<p>Additionally, League of Legends is un-vaulting Firefighter Tristana on January 23rd until February 5th. Firefighter Tristana was originally released back in 2010, and is one of the rarer skins that League fans have wanted to get their hands on.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the beginning of today’s VALORANT Champions Tour Americas broadcast, Head of VALORANT Esports Leo Faria addressed the wildfires. He implored fans to donate to the California Fire Foundation and the International Medical Corps.</p>



<p>Since the wildfires began tearing up the city, Riot has provided temporary housing and stipends to displaced employees, donated meals, and even provided a backup generator to a local fire station that had lost power. The developer says it is “in this for the long-term and will support both the immediate response and years-long recovery efforts in Southern California.”</p>



<p>Willing to support LA wildfire relief by buying some skins? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
