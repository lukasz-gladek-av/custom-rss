            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received another update, which along with some general fixes also makes changes to courses selected in Random during an online VS Race.</p>
<p>While the update notes for Ver. 1.1.2, as it is known, simply state the Mario Kart World team has "adjusted courses selected in 'Random' when selecting next course in a wireless 'VS Race'", there is more to it than it may first appear.</p>

<p>Prior to this update going live, if a player selected Randon during course selection while racing online, it would always result in a more traditional three lap race, rather than Mario Kart World's community dubbed "intermission tracks". These are the tracks that essentially run in one long and almost linear layout, and connect Mario Kart World's, well, world.</p>
<p>Now, however, these intermission tracks have been added to the online Random fray, which means playing Mario Kart World in a more 'traditional' way with consistent three-lapped courses is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some online are rather unhappy with this development. "Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way'," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/">reads one comment on ResetEra</a>. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> update 1.5 is out now, the patch, which has been branded as the ‘Guns and Looting Patch’, bringing new weapons, new gameplay features and official mod support.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting a the top, there are two new weapons included in the patch, with a new sniper rifle and a new pistol:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Three-Line Rifle:</strong> A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle with impressive range and precision. Ideal for sharpshooters, this rifle has quickly become a favorite among veterans of the Zone. Encounter it early in your journey and test your aim against distant threats.</li>
<li><strong>Kora Pistol:</strong> A heavy-hitting, clunky pistol that sacrifices speed for raw power. Each shot from its limited magazine packs a punch, making it a must-have for stalkers who value impactful firepower. Seek out the rare Night Stalker variant, a unique Kora coveted by weapon collectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further enhancement for patch 1.5 is Mutant Parts Trading. When you defeat bloodsuckers, fleshes, and other mutants, they now drop various parts like eyes, tusks and tentacles, which are apparently quite valuable and can be traded to NPCs for coupons. First you must visit Malachite to learn how to harvest them in a tradable condition, though.</p>

<p>Beyond that, patch 1.5 has a bunch of quality of life and system improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further A-Life improvements:
<ul>
<li>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player’s view.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.<wbr></li>
<li>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.<wbr></li>
<li>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants’ lair, for example, those mutants won’t simply reappear moments later.<wbr></li>
<li>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone’s population.<wbr></li>
<li>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the “pop-in” effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Electric Water Tornado anomaly.</li>
<li>New vehicle models scattered across the terrain.</li>
<li>Expanded stash window size for better inventory management.</li>
<li>Distinct icons for each ammo type, making identification effortless.</li>
<li>Reload renewal, allowing Skif to seamlessly resume interrupted reloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, full and official mod support has arrived in the form of The Zone Kit. Available on the Epic Games Store, this allows players to reshape the Zone and tweak gameplay to their heart’s content. Mods can then be shared via mod.io and Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>It allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify or create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and anomalies.</li>
<li>Adjust gameplay to suit your preferences, whether you’re seeking more challenge, less difficulty, or something entirely new.</li>
<li>Share creations effortlessly via mod.io or Steam Workshop, depending on the platform.</li>
<li>Future updates will add even more functionality to the Zone Kit, ensuring endless creative possibilities. This marks Phase One of the mod support launch, so stay tuned for future updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very healthy update already, even in short, but the full patch notes high level patch notes for STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 are also available – <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-5">more detailed and granular patch notes are available here</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

<p>Let's have a World Party!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team17 and Digital Eclipse have unleashed the latest update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> on the Switch, adding three additional retro games to the title.</p>
<p>So not only can you play <strong>Worms Armageddon</strong> and its charming Game Boy Color counterpart, but you now also have access to the SNES version of <strong>Worms</strong>, the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive version, and <strong>Worms World Party</strong> for the GBA.</p>
<p>Granted, there are still a boatload of Worms games to cover, but what was originally a neat little throwback to a single entry in the franchise is slowly morphing into a wider celebration of creator Andy Davidson's remarkably addictive series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In addition to the extra games, a ‘Boggy B’ cheat code has been added based on community feedback, and basically unlocks all content in the game immediately. Get in! This is also toggleable in the main menu, for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>We reviewed Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition last year and called it "another slam dunk for Digital Eclipse and its ongoing mission of game preservation and historical documentation". It received a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>For now, let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Re-live 1999 with this faithful rendition of Worms™ Armageddon. With all the hilarious fun and madness you know and love.</p>
<p>- New Display features to suit modern hardware.</p>
<p>- An interactive documentary about Worms Armageddon alongside a museum timeline charting the history of the series.</p>
<p>- Also included is a fully playable version of the game released for Gameboy Color.</p>
<p>- Use over 55 classically weird and wonderful weapons and tools including Earthquake, Freeze and French Sheep Strike.</p>
<p>- Play single-player Deathmatch plus an exciting 40+ mission campaign</p>
<p>- Over 30 custom and comedy sound banks (including stiff upper lip, Cyberworms and more).</p>
<p>- Beloved features from the multi-player mode: Handicapping (add or deduct energy for a team), Allied Teams (team up with others to target another player), ‘Worms Disease’, Home Runs and many, many more.</p>

            <p>
Kindly Father Internet has dispensed a few new details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader </a>dev Owlcat’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">recently announced</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adaptation of the sci-fi book and TV show series. It sounds like it’s operating within the fine tradition of spin-off stories that are always a step behind or a room across from the live action celebrities.</p>
<p>I refer to games like The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, in which the noble human ranger Alsogorn, the stout dwarven warrior Simarli, the shieldmaiden Eowynnish and the other members of the Followship of the Ring pitch in with Gandalf, Faramir and co in scenes that might have been lifted from Petey Jackson's cutting room floor. Except that turning the Balrog bridge fight into a five-way Final Fantasy slapfest is just naff.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Osiris Reborn will hopefully not be naff, going by Owlcat’s prior work in the party-based RPG space, and in light of the game’s admittedly target-footagesque announcement trailer. It takes place in parallel to the first two seasons of the Expanse TV show, and gives you a new set of characters. Things kick off on Eros Station, an asteroid city that takes a turn for the Eventfully Horizontal in the original James S.A. Corey books. The infamous protomolecule makes an appearance, as do corpo shitlords Protogen, and you'll hear a lot about the doings of a certain James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante.

"You will be seeing with your own eyes the repercussions of Holden's actions, all the situations like The Canterbury, and how it affects people in the belt, people in the inner planets," observes creative director Alexander Mishulin in a chat with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-will-take-cues-from-mass-effect-souls-games-and-more/">CNET</a>. "You will be having your own adventure with your own goals, choices, consequences in the same universe [with] all the major events unfolding in this universe alongside your story." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> aside, Mishulin says that the storytelling is “similar” to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> in how your party members develop over the course of the tale. Crew members who don’t join your three-person away missions won’t twiddle their thumbs in your absence – they can go on jaunts elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for the other kind of character development, making numbers go up and down, “the RPG system is very open, allowing you to build whatever character you like”. There are no classes, which may come as a relief to those of us racked and corroded by Rogue Trader’s cyclopean skilltrees. Seemingly, there is a stronger emphasis on how weapons shape your approach than in previous Owlcat RPGs, though that’s me peering between the lines of the CNET piece. Gadgets include a visor that lets you identify foes through smoke and cover, which isn’t too mindblowing, but definitely helpful. 
</p>
<p>
The game courts the same “hard sci-fi” feel as the show, including the "feeling of the physics and how it should be" in outer space. The protomolecule in the ointment is that while you’ll get your own, lightly customisable ship and be able to fly around in it, they’re won’t be any ship-to-ship combat. No emergency deceleration manoeuvrers, no intricate missile tactics. I guess I’ll have to get my fill of that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.

According to the game's director, Brandon Adler, Obsidian Entertainment knew the sequel needed to be a significant improvement over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-review-over-the-moon/1900-6417345/" data-ref-id="1900-6417345">The Outer Worlds</a>. To achieve that goal, the team turned to the developers of Halo for advice.</p><p>"We ... talked to the Halo folks," Adler tells <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/25/the-outer-worlds-2-the-most-expensive-xbox-game-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. "They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, 'You guys should target this… you should add that to your weapon configurations.'" Adler also says that Obsidian "did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that [gunplay] felt.'"</p><p>Adler notes that the sequel doesn't have loading screens before entering buildings like its predecessor, and the weapons have been revamped with fresh options and customizable features.</p><p>"We didn't want small changes," continues Adler. "Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose. You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things."</p><p>One of the other changes in the sequel is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-lets-players-choose-between-first-and-third-person/1100-6532273/" data-ref-id="1100-6532273">players can swap from first-person to third-person at will</a>, and decide how they want to experience the game.

                <p>Late last year, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player named Sebastian Araujo alleging that he used cheating software on multiple occasions during tournament play that allowed him to beat players who followed the game's rules. Now, Epic has announced that the court has made a summary judgment in its favor, in part because Araujo never responded to the lawsuit.</p><p>Epic shared the news on social media and noted that the judgment was for $175,000. Additionally, Araujo has been banned from Fortnite for life. Epic also stated that it plans to donate any money it collects to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/site/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Child's Play</a>, a charity that provides sick children in hospitals with toys and games to keep their spirits raised and encourage healing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">THIS JUST IN: The Judge ruled in our favor after the cheater ignored our lawsuit.

Earlier this year, Epic took action against pro Fortnite player Morgan Bamford aka RepulseGod and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-shows-why-cheaters-never-prosper-after-epic-successfully-sues-pro-player/1100-6529540/" data-ref-id="1100-6529540">banned them from ever taking part in the game's organized tournaments again</a>. Bamford subsequently apologized and returned the prize money to Epic, which once again donated the total to Child's Play.</p><p>Cheaters aren't the only ones who have to fear Epic's legal reprisals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we’re being assaulted by a barrage of new peripherals to go alongside it. Turtle Beach, never one to miss an opportunity to sell the odd headset or two, have seen fit to launch an all-new version of the Airlite Fit, previously a PDP product but now brought under the welcoming branches of the palm tree-toting brand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Airlite Fit" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ucyy5jaW_-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a budget headset. At £27.99 – and available for as low as £19.99 – the Airlite Fit is seriously affordable, and while it’s likely aimed at the younger gamers in your household, with its original Switch blue and red livery, older gamers will find that this is a comfortable and surprisingly great-sounding headset.</p>


<p>I’ve been putting the Airlite Fit through its paces with the Switch 2, and as a 3.5mm wired headset, I’ve been able to pair it with the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. It’s an ideal match, and you’ll find that there’s heaps of volume to drown out any external sounds, despite the Airlite Fit’s relatively weak passive noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Airlite Fit lives up to its name by being exceedingly light. That’s thanks to the plastics used in the build, from the earcups through to the headband. There’s a serious amount of flex to the headset, and I worried about the sturdiness at first without any metal running through the centre. I didn’t need to worry, though, as you can twist it into all sorts of worrying shapes before it returns to its original shape. I don’t think it’s going to last as long as some headsets out there, but it’s solid enough to survive through regular play.</p>


<p>There’s then memory foam padding in the headband, and in the earpads, covered by soft jersey knit fabric, which helps to keep comfort levels good throughout extended play. The Airlite Fit does a decent job at this price point, but if you’re used to the finer things in life, or just a headset that’s a step or two up the price scale, then you’ll likely notice the slightly harsher plastics and fabric more keenly.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about the Airlite Fit is just how good they sound. Outfitted with well-tuned 40mm drivers, there’s a lot of Turtle Beach’s trademark bombast to the audio output, giving every encounter a huge amount of drama thanks to the enhanced bass. It doesn’t come at the cost of the top end though, and they outpace some far more expensive headsets and headphones.</p>
<p>Whether that’s been testing out massive RPG hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma</a> or the new Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, or diving into multiplayer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, gaming sounds great with the Airlite Fit in tow, and there’s a lot to be said for the ease of plugging in a wired headset, and using its single volume wheel control.</p>

<p>That continues into other media, and listening to music, especially rock, metal and rap, really benefit from the tuning of the Airlite Fit. There’s not quite the detail you’ll find in more expensive or specialised headsets, but there’s drama and depth, with tracks like Bad Omen’s The Death of Peace of Mind, or Fort Minor’s Where’d You Go sounding absolutely great.</p>
<p>Thanks to its recent update, I’ve played a heap of Splatoon 3, with the added bonus of Switch 2’s onboard Gamechat functionality finally bringing Nintendo fully into the modern multiplayer age. The noise-cancelling mic is another high point for the Airlite Fit, with a flip-to-mute adjustable mic arm that sits exactly where you put it, with loads of adjustability. If you don’t want to use it, it sits well out of the way, but it’s exactly where you need it when it’s time to shout at your friends.</p>

<p>As we reported just a little while ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/everybodys-golf-hot-shots-brings-the-par-tee-to-switch-this-september">Everybody's Golf will be swinging onto Nintendo Switch</a> this September 5th in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hotshots</a>.</p>
<p>Following on from the reveal of the official release date, Bandai Namco has now dropped a juicy video showing almost five whole minutes of gameplay. You can check out the trailer above, and we have to say, it's all looking pretty much as expected for a series that certainly has its own unique thing going on.</p>
<p>Here's some delicious PR deets from Bandai Namco to tell us even more!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tons of Customization</strong> - Customize stats, clubs and balls to match every character’s play style</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Largest Roster</strong> – With a series-leading 25+ playable characters available, build up character loyalty to unlock new shots, including spin shots, homing shots and character-specific special shots.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Caddie</strong> <strong>Support</strong> - Team up with caddies to get detailed play tips, support skills, and more.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Challenge Mode</strong> Join tournaments in solo play to fight to the top! Unlock more characters, scenarios and even bigger tournaments to become the ultimate golfer.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>World Tour</strong> – Spanning 10 regions across the globe, discover charming character interactions unique to each player.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Wacky Golf</strong> – This brand new mode brings chaos to the course with obstacles, challenges, and more in either solo or multiplayer mode, including Colorful, Scramble, Survival Golf and Dokkan Golf modes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Everybody's Golf Hotshots has raised a few eyebrows lately after its Steam page disclosed the minor detail that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/hot-shots-golf-fans-fume-at-use-of-generative-ai-in-ps5-revival">some of its background foliage is created using generative AI</a>, which is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">certainly a hot topic of debate at the moment</a> (and not a good look, in all honesty),so it's up to you to decide where the line is drawn on that particular aspect of this one.</p>
<p>One thing we don't get any news on here, unfortunately, is whether or not we can expect any kind of Switch 2 version, but perhaps that's something for further down the line. We'll keep you posted!</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to some Everybody's Golf Hot Shots on Switch? Be sure to swing by and let us know.</em></p>

            <p>The American Federal Trade Commission has given out a further $126 million (around £91 million) in refunds to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who've been "charged for unwanted purchases", bringing the overall total issued so far to about $200 million. It's also given eligible players who're yet to submit a refund claim some extra time to do so.</p>
<p>These refunds are the ongoing fallout to a pair of complaints made to the FTC over Fortnite, which Epic opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-settle-fortnite-privacy-and-purchase-complaints-for-520-million">settle in late 2022</a> by paying a combined total of $520 million (£427 million). Epic were accused of breaching the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting data on under 13 Fortnite players without parental consent, and deliberately using tactics such as confusing button placements intended to push folks into buying cosmetics from the Fortnite store unintentionally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The latter of those is what these refunds from the FTC are being issued to remedy, with $245 million of the settlement gradually being given out to affected players in the US. This <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims">latest $126 million wave of refunds</a> is the second one, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement">the first</a> having totalled over $72 million and been issued in December 2024.</p>
<p>The FTC says it's sending out "969,173 checks and PayPal payments" across June 25 and 26 this time around, so it's worth taking a look in those two places if you submitted a claim, as the body encourage cashing or accepting it within 90 days or 30 days respectively. They also note that claims made later than February 14, 2025 are still being reviewed.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process. Players who have not already filed a claim will now have until July 9 to submit one: <a href="https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z">https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z</a></p>— FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>If you're in America and meet the rest of the criteria <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds">outlined here</a>, you can still apply for a Fortnite refund for a little while longer, with the FTC having reopened claims until July 9.</p>
<p>Games should go above and beyond to make sure players even more clearly understand when they are making a purchase with real money or with virtual currencies to prevent accidental purchases," Epic wrote in a statement issued about the settlement back in 2022.</p>
<p>"We don’t want players to pay for something that they did not intend to," they continued, "Since May 2018, Fortnite has had a refund token system and an undo-purchase system, but now we've gone further. We’ve updated our payment flows with a hold-to-purchase mechanic that re-confirms a player’s intent to buy, as an additional safeguard to prevent unintended purchases alongside instant purchase cancellations and self-service refunds."</p>
<p>Here's hoping everyone affected gets the refund they deserve.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-players-receive-126-million-more-in-refunds-from-the-ftc-over-epics-deceptive-billing-practices]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alongside a single player career mode reveal, Straight4 Studios has confirmed that Project Motor Racing will launch on 24th November across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO (and controversially outspoken figurehead) Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>
<p>The career mode aims to provide a realistic take on motorsports careers, featuring over 70 vehicles from 10 different racing classes, going from 1970s sports cars through to modern GT3s and LMDh hypercars, and it will have 27 scanned real world tracks.</p>
<p>The career mode, as detailed in the trailer, looks fascinating. Instead of something akin to Gran Turismo where you take winnings, earn trophy cars and build a garage, the career gives you a starting point of your choice, and then challenges you to succeed and progress through financial earnings and smart moves. It’s not all about winning, but it is about your winnings.</p>

<p>You’ll have one of three financial backstories, set a location for your team – which affects entry fees and competitions available – and then choose financial backing through sponsors. There’s no car unlocks or levelling up needed for the top tier of racing, outside of simply needing to be able to afford them. Of course, higher and more generous sponsorship models (which could cover travel fees separately from base pay and performance bonuses) will come with higher demands, and if you can’t meet them, you could be out on your ear pretty quickly. Crashes and damage will also have an impact, as that cost comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>It’s another interesting take on the concept, similar to how Project CARS let you start at any racing category, and will be fascinating to see how the financing is tuned and balanced in the game.</p>
<p>Of course PMR will also have a full suite of online multiplayer racing, focusing on more sim-minded gamers with features like full race weekends to test yourself again.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on for sim-racing fans and those looking for a fresh alternative to the more established examples of the genre.</p>

<p>Ready for an intermission?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is now live, and the main change it's brought comes via the following patch note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Adjusted courses selected in “Random” when selecting next course in a wireless “VS Race.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what does this mean? Well, prior to the update, selecting a standard race when competing online would give you the option to choose either an intermission race from a set selection of three courses, or choose something at random. The random option would often ditch the intermission setup in favour of a standard 3-lap race around one of the game's excellent themed courses.</p>
<p>So if you happen to see the vast majority of players choosing 'random' when selecting a course, this is why.</p>
<p>The update has changed this, and according to many fans, it's proven to be a bit of a slap in the face. Basically, Nintendo is now doubling down on the intermission races, meaning you begin the race on a rolling start and drive across the roads toward the selected track. So while it <em>is</em> still possible to land a standard 3-lap race, the probability of doing so has plummeted.</p>
<p>So yeah, fans aren't particularly happy with the update, as demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TWD98">TWD98</a>'s YouTube video above. Folks are also voicing their concerns over on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/mario-kart-world-st-drift-of-the-wild.13952/page-50">Famiboards</a>, with user CoralSensei4 stating "I was genuinely having fun playing this game and perfecting the three lap tracks for online and this just ruined all of that practice".</p>
<p>Our very own community user <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mario-kart-world-has-been-updated-to-version-1-1-2-here-are-the-full-patch-notes#comment8710259">Ade117</a> echoed this sentiment in our recent update article and said "What a downer of an update. I prefer to play 3 laps around a track, but Nintendo wants that to be as difficult as possible to do online".</p>
<p>Famiboards member hushh went one step further and said "Well that was basically a waste of money I guess. Won't touch this game until this tone deaf and idiotic decision is fixed".</p>
<p>We've no doubt Nintendo will continue to apply updates to Mario Kart World in the coming days, weeks, months, and even years. Here's hoping it takes feedback on board and makes standard 3-lap races an option for online play again.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2.1228758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, TEAMGROUP announced the launch of its new <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/product-detail/card/TEAMGROUP/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express-TAPMSDE1TIV30A102/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEX SD7.1 MicroSD Express Card</a>, which promises 'next-generation high-speed storage for handheld gaming'. Its primary usage case is, of course, with the Nintendo Switch 2 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 features a PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and NVMe protocol and has an A1 rating for application performance, delivering significantly faster data transfer speeds. Thanks to the PCIe lane, the APEX SD7.1 offers read speeds far beyond those of traditional microSD cards of up to 800MB/s, which is 8x and 2.6x faster than the TEAMGROUP ELITE MicroSDXC A1 V30 (max 100MB/s) and T-CREATE EXPERT SDXC V90 (max 300MB/s), respectively.</p>
<p>It offers optimal performance on devices with a MicroSD Express slot, such as the aforementioned Nintendo Switch 2, but it remains fully backward compatible with handheld consoles and mobile devices that support standard MicroSD cards, such as the original Switch or Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>TEAMGROUP produced the card in capacities of 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1TB, with the highest capacity model able to store up to 18 games (assuming the average size is 26.8GB, like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition). It also supports Video Speed Class V30 and 4K UHD video recording, making it ideal for capturing smooth, high-resolution footage.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 has multiple protection features to ensure durability and quality. It is resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments. The product includes a limited lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pricing details are not available yet. We have contacted TEAMGROUP to get them and will update this story if we receive them.</p>

			<p>The pirate-themed multiplayer survival adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crosswind</a> has opened up its Alpha Test <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, and anyone can now request access for a chance to join and check out this interesting title. This Alpha Test phase will run for at least four weeks, and there is no NDA, so those who are selected will be able to share their impressions, images, and videos captured while playing.</p>
<p>The following content is available in this build of Crosswind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three unique biomes, each with its own resources, enemies, and environment twists<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three bosses, each offered in several difficulty tiers<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three playable ships plus one NPC merchant vessel<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground combat, ship-to-ship battles, and the very first pass at boarding actions<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly 30+ hours of content if you take the time to explore<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Crosswind: Drunken Sailor (Alpha Test Trailer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2BHDLprl6xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a recent Steam blog post, the Crosswind Crew also clarified that this is a survival adventure game first and foremost, and that's the focus of this playtest, while an MMO-like layer is planned to be added later.</p>
<p><em>The game's structure is as follows: 'A player-controlled world plus various shared zones'. Each player has their own world in which the main story unfolds. This is a large archipelago comprising a dozen islands, a variety of biomes, resources, enemies and secrets. Most of it is procedurally generated, but some of the key points of interest are hand-crafted. This means that your world won't be the same as your friend's. You have full control over who can visit your world. You can keep it private. Alternatively, you can invite your friends to explore, craft and build with you, or even fight alongside you.</em></p>
<p><em>The MMO part of Crosswind consists of shared zones for various PvE and PvP activities. As you progress through the main story, you will unlock the ability to travel to other locations. These are shared among players. For example, in the upcoming playtest, we will have an early prototype of Tortuga. For now, it's just a place to trade goods and meet other players, but in the future, we'll transform it into a bustling social hub where you can discover new activities, make new friends, and even challenge someone to a duel! Other zones and activities, such as a naval PvP zone, will be added later in the development process, thus expanding the MMO part of Crosswind. We see PvP as an additional way to enjoy the game. It will be optional and take time to implement properly.&nbsp;</em></p>

Also it's bloody depressing and I need to keep the mood up. Nothing else for it. Time to bring back a perennial audience favourite. Here's a tray-tray.</p>

<p>Developer Cyber Temple were kind enough to send me a preview build. Pre-warning: I only played an hour, because I didn't enjoy it very much. So, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3132870/DarkSwitch/">Steam sell</a> in case you want to ignore my opinions and just pop it on the wishlist for the inevitable demo - something I always heartily recommend.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Gather resources, research technologies, and send pioneers to explore the ruins of those who came before: discover their secrets and doom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set in a world of folk horror and creeping dread, DarkSwitch blends vertical city-building, tower defense, and exploration into a unique strategic experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navigate a stunning, dangerous, dark fantasy world enriched by cinematic cutscenes and an atmospheric soundtrack from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Opinion the first, they only get worse: Akira Yamaoka is phoning it in. The music is pleasant and richly layered but nothing to write home about, unless perhaps you haven't spoken to your family in yonks and need a very tenuous coversation starter. Ah well! You play as a colony of elves and their architecture is suitably Rivendallian. Being elves they think they know it all and don't bother giving you much onboarding. This where the issues start. A style over substance UI. Exclamation points appear over buildings with no indication of what they mean. There's a counter down the right hand side of the screen, no tooltips or other explanations, ditto the 'Fear' counter in the top right.</p>
<p>The tutorial, such as it is, tells you <em>what</em> to do, but not how to do it. Not too tricky to work out, usually. But crucially, you're not told <em>why</em> you're doing it either. My people are hungry so I need to collect mushrooms, I can work that out. But what am I placing two 'flame guards' down? A tooltip tells me they have something to do with the fog that creeps in at night, and my citizens, but I'm given no further explanation and no indication of where to place to them. And the more crucial thing here is, since the game seems to be working backwards in terms of goals and motivations, there's little of Frostpunk's demanding energy or intrigue. I eventually peace out after digging in every menu for a tutorial-demanded building extension I just can't find.</p>
<p>Also, look. I've previously bemoaned the state of latent paranoia that the proliferation of AI art encourages, turning us all into little art purity witchhunters whenever something <em>might</em> be machine generated. All I'm saying is, if I perhaps wanted to avoid such speculation, I would not have gone for this particular look with the character portraits:</p>

</figure>
<p>Apologies to Eldric Flambet. And that said, I really like how this wooden walkway automatically connects between buildings, and also how you can build structures on the trunk of the tree itself, Ewok style:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Cyber Temple</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do still think the concept is really compelling. The writing is terse and veers simple but does its job. Some culty flamemen called Luminarchs show up in an airship after a bit and start interrogating and stealing my townsfolk. I'd like to know where that goes. And it's a pre-demo press preview build, right? I'm sure the developer sent it out because they know it isn't quite where they need it to be and wanted to see how the press reacted, so here's my reaction: sort out the first hour. Make me obsessed with your world rather than just a bit irritated at what parts you've seemingly randomly chosen to obscure from me, and give me an interesting goal straight away rather than just telling me to build things with no real sense of what I'm working towards. Otherwise: Nice elvish buildings. Nice concept. And, yes, very nice tree (hey!)</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkswitch-is-frostpunk-in-a-big-tree-with-music-from-silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka]]></content:encoded>

<p>The twist here is that you'll be trying to keep your midnight proclivities a secret from the townfolk, brushing the proverbial Chocolate Hobnob crumbs of forbidden arcane arts out of your beard and burning the packet before everyone else wakes up. There's a sort of social stealth system, too, that sees you chocolate hobnobbing at high society parties, presumably trying to not open every conversation with "Hi I'm Terry and all my mates are animated cadavers". There's also an excellent fully illustrated spellbook.</p>
<p>CRPGs come in a few flavours usually. You've got your swordies and wordies and the occasional nicely balanced swordy-wordy. NecTales has hex-based combat where you cast spells, backed up by your gang of flaky shamblers and clattering calcium lads, but otherwise looks to be hanging about on the wordy side of the scale. "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore," to be precise, alongside hand-drawn portraits for 180+ NPCs. "We have not used any generative AI in the game", say developers Psychic Software. Good by me. If I wanted to engage with a pallid, grotesque simulacrum of something real, I'd raise another zombie.</p>
<p>The game is set near alternate history Venice on the cusp of the Enlightenment - a setting apparently rife for exacerbated tensions between science and superstition. This history is not so alternative, however, as to prevent Twickenhamese satirist Alexander Pope popping up in the corner, presumably to bang on about Homer to anyone in earshot.</p>
<p>The Necromancer's Tale is out next month, July 17th. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">demo on Steam</a> available now.

As you’d imagine, it’s a story filled with complex terminologies, philosophical concepts, metaphysics, and more, but we’re here to help you make sense of it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, whether you finished the sequel and need help understanding the full picture of the ending, or just looking to see how Hideo Kojima’s newest adventure unfolds, here’s our full Ending Explained for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Setting the scene</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 picks up 11 months after the events of the first Death Stranding. Following the successful connection of the former United States to the Chiral Network (this world’s magical internet that is helping the world rebuild following the apocalyptic titular Death Stranding), defeating the terrorist leader Higgs, and preventing his sister Amelie from destroying the world, Sam Porter Bridges attempts to settle into a quiet life with his daughter, Lou. But that idea is quickly brought to a halt by the reappearance of former accomplice Fragile and her new company, Drawbridge, when she asks Sam to head south and get Mexico back on the grid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon connecting Mexico to the Chiral Network, it’s discovered that linking together a country appears to open a Plate Gate (a giant teleportation portal) to other continents. This is vital because after the events of the Death Stranding, civilization is still largely separated from each other, and Plate Gates would go a long way towards making Earth one interconnected society again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as Sam completes his Mexican mission, tragedy strikes when a mysterious armed group in red invades Sam’s home and kills Lou and injures Fragile, sending Sam into a depressive spiral over the loss of his child. Lost, he agrees to join Drawbridge and the crew of its ship, the DHV Magellan, on a mission to connect Australia, the destination of the Mexican Plate Gate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Who are the Armed Red Attackers?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-50-00-still020-1741556559513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You got red on you. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Knowing who attacked Lou and Fragile is the first step to understanding the ending of Death Stranding 2. The group in Red are mechanical soldiers 3D printed by a reborn Higgs, who, after the events of the first game, killed himself on his Beach only to come back as a glam rock mercenary robot hellbent on getting revenge on Sam and Fragile. This is why he attacks her and Lou.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Higgs didn’t just come back to life by himself. His soul was revived thanks to an entity known as APAS, a private corporation that manages the automated delivery robots transporting packages around the UCA. Their goal is to connect Mexico and later Australia to the Chiral Network to open even more Plate Gates and eventually link up the whole world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But behind the scenes, APAS is actually run by a sentient entity known as APAS 4000, which is the fusion of the APAS AI system that manages deliveries and 4000 human souls from people who were killed in a massive Voidout. Their ultimate goal is to elevate all humans into souls, preventing humanity from evolving and instead keeping them trapped in the world of the dead, stopping them from triggering another Voidout ever again. A benevolent, but ultimately misguided attempt to try and contain humanity from once again exploring the world and making connections with one another. It would keep Earth’s population safe, but at the cost of what makes them human, changing people further into digital entities in the shape of their saviors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Sam Defeats APAS 4000</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-05-53-20-still054-1741556849891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is this charismatic...doll? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game of cat-and-mouse, APAS 4000 believes it is using Sam to further its goal of one day containing humanity from ever leaving their shelters ever again. But behind the scenes, Fragile’s Drawbridge knows about this plan and is working to stop APAS 4000. Fragile and Drawbridge’s benefactor, who is eventually revealed to be former President of the UCA, Die-Hardman, as well as the crew of the DHV Magellan, were in fact connecting various settlements in Australia using a new Q-Pid. This device would sever the connection between the world of the living and the dead, and by extension, cut off APAS 4000’s connection to the world due to it being an entity made up of dead souls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By fully connecting Australia with the new Q-Pid, APAS 4000 is split from the world of the living, and its plan to trap humanity fails.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wait, but what about Higgs?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-06-42-07-still038-1741556559514.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Higgs returns. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Higgs may have been brought back by APAS 4000 to try and push along its plans, Higgs is by no means a lackey. Instead, Higgs uses his newfound robot body to carry out a separate, more personally fuelled plan of revenge. It was he who attacked Fragile and Lou while Sam was busy reconnecting Mexico, and eventually it’s revealed that Higgs plans to finish what he started in the first Death Stranding game and bring about the end of the world via “The Last Stranding”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas in the first game, Higgs tried to use the Extinction Entity known as Amelie to trigger the earth-ending event, this time he tries to use Tomorrow, a young woman Sam recovers from the world of the dead, who has mysterious powers that allow her to use tar to speed up decay. By using Tomorrow as an Extinction Entity, Higgs’ plan is to once and for all end human life, killing Sam and Fragile in the process. While Sam manages to defeat Higgs and finally end his apocalyptic fantasy via a combo of samurai sword duelling, electric guitar battle, and good ol’ fashioned fistfight, Higgs does succeed in completing one of his goals…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fragile Dies</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-17-25-still015-1741556559512.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A hero's death. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For much of Death Stranding 2, we’re made to think thatFragile survived the attack by Higgs, but Lou died. In reality, Fragile used her trans-dimensional teleportation powers to send Lou to the world of the dead, while Fragile was the one killed by Higgs. Because time dilation and the distinction between life and death are all kinds of messed up in the world of Death Stranding, the Fragile that Sam and the DHV Magellan crew have been travelling with the entire game is actually Fragile’s soul that she temporarily left behind to help Sam and the crew defeat Higgs, stop APAS 4000, and reconnect the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, her time in the world of the living is only temporary, and she dies for real at the end of the game. But what about Lou?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>BB-28/Lou/Tomorrow/Louise</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-11-14-22-still038-1750343168751.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is she? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, Lou was spared in the attack by Higgs in Mexico as Fragile used her powers to send Lou to another beach, effectively another dimension. Sent away by Fragile, Lou grew up in the world of the dead as manifested by the soldier Neil Vanna (more on him later). Years later, Sam Porter Bridges will end up fighting Neil in this world and inadvertently rescue Lou, who is none other than Tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, Tomorrow is in fact the same baby Lou that Fragile sent away at the start of the game. Lou, short for Louise, is also BB-28 that Sam traveled across the UCA with in Death Stranding, and more than that, is actually Sam’s biological daughter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Neil, Sam, and Lucy Love Triangle</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/06/death-stranding-blog-1749244480461.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vana. Neil Vana. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, now we explain the final puzzle that ties all of Death Stranding 2 together. So Louise survives Higgs’ initial attack in Mexico and grows up to become Tomorrow. But why did Higgs want Lou in the first place?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because decades ago, Sam, who I should remind you is a Repatriate — someone who can resurrect themselves thanks to the effects of the Death Stranding — was in a relationship with a therapist named Lucy. Around this time, Lucy was seeing another patient, a man named Neil Vana, who was a smuggler working for Bridges to deliver illegally acquired brain-dead pregnant women whose stillborn babies would become the very first Bridge Babies. Wracked with guilt, Neil sought the help of Lucy, who, it turns out, saved Neil when they were both children from the same village under attack by BTs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reunited after all those years, Neil rekindles a relationship with Lucy that becomes romantic even though Lucy was in a relationship with Sam at the time. Despite Neil and Lucy’s close relationship, Lucy chose to stay with Sam, and together they conceived a child.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a baby born from a Repatriate like Sam held high value for Bridges, who were still conducting their original experiments with BBs. Once they discovered Lucy’s pregnancy, Bridges sought to take the child from her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To protect the unborn baby Louise, Lucy convinced Neil to pretend to be the father of the child, making the baby less valuable to Bridges. Together with the baby, they would escape the city and Bridges, but would sadly never make it that far as both Neil and Lucy are killed, but not before Louise is removed from Lucy’s dying body, thus saving the baby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Louise becomes BB-28, but is thankfully hidden away by Sam’s adoptive mother and President of the United States, Bridget Strand, keeping her hidden long enough to be reunited with Sam decades later during the events of the original Death Stranding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Neil, his final act of revenge against Bridges is for his body to necrotize, therefore causing a Voidout and destroying the city and everyone in it. Meanwhile, Neil’s soul wanders the earth, unable to find peace. Similar to  Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff in the first game, Neil’s mercenary soul haunts Sam until the two men face off in a destined duel that finally gives Neil peace and Sam closure with Lucy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Post-credits scene, and will we get a Death Stranding 3?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/vs-youtube-deathstranding2onthebeachendingandfinalbossfight4k-6911-1750884722656.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will there be a Death Stranding 3? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that isn’t quite the end of the revelations. Yes, Death Stranding 2 does have a post-credit scene, and it features a seemingly even more grown-up Tomorrow/Louise dressed up in full porter gear, as well as inheriting Fragile’s creepy second set of hands and her smoking habit. She’s faced with a Plate Gate, perhaps signalling that she’ll follow in her father’s steps and attempt to connect another new continent to the Chiral Network. Could Death Stranding 3 have us going to Europe, Asia, or Africa, for example? And could we be playing as Tomorrow in the sequel? We certainly wouldn’t say no to playing around with her unique tar-infused martial arts skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s the full ending of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach explained.

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83b515fc5533b/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is bringing out a new "fast-paced" multiplayer game this August called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, where players will be able to "shoot hoops" with the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 dual-mouse controls.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">release date announcement</a> earlier this week, the eShop listing for this upcoming title has now revealed this "3-on-3" sports title will actually support double this amount online, bumping the fun up to 12 players. Details about this have not been provided just yet.</p>
<p>While this is exciting news, local multiplayer will apparently be restricted to just one player. So even if you have an extra set of Joy-Con 2 or someone nearby who is ready for a local wireless session across two units, it seems you'll still need to team up online with an active Switch Online subscription. If we hear any changes or updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Nintendo's page listing for Drag x Drive also reconfirms TV mode and Tabletop mode will be supported. You can find out more about Drag x Drive in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Update on the Switch 2 today</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54b79c38cdbff/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been rolling out game updates every week since the Switch 2 arrived earlier this month, and we've now got a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>This follows a small patch last week and bumps the game up to Version 1.1.2. It comes with some general adjustments and also resolves some more issues you may or may not have encountered during the game's races.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Ver. 1.1.2 (Released June 25, 2025)<br></h3>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted courses selected in “Random” when selecting next course in a wireless “VS Race.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made readjustments to fix an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Online Play” and “Knockout Tour.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes can’t recover quickly after falling off the course in "Dino Dino Jungle".</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you continually hit the wall near the finish line of “Boo Cinema” when transformed into Bullet Bill.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Dataminer 'OatmealDome' has shared <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1938057415347343870">what else is going on behind the scenes</a> in this latest Mario Kart World update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Random option can now also pick from the options you are given (i.e. courses with an intermission) in version 1.1.2. It *can* still choose to teleport everyone to a random course with 3 laps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> yesterday. Nintendo has also updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> this week.</p>
