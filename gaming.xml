            <p>What's going on in the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the NetEase hero shooter that is forecast to get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">two new heroes every three month season</a>, and thus stands to double its starting roster of 33 heroes providing it stays afloat for at least four years? The word on the street is that they're adding new Team-Up skills in Season 2, beginning 11th April - and when I say "the word on the street", I mean it's been officially confirmed by game director Guangyun Chen. I apologise, I will try not to sound like a cool reporter again.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The content for Season 2 is ready and set to go," Chen observed in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-growing-roster-of-heroes-scares-me-but-the-games-director-seems-sure-that-all-is-under-control-everything-is-progressing-smoothly/">Peter Parker Gamer</a>. "The designs for Seasons 3 and 4 have also been completed and are currently under intensive development! Overall, everything is progressing smoothly."</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been progressing smoothly for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">the people they laid off last month</a>, and let's not forget about NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-plan-to-reset-ranks-mid-season-hastily-abandoned-in-the-face-of-player-revolt">suddenly junking plans to reset player ranks mid-season following an outcry</a>. But Marvel Rivals continues to attract droves of players.</p>
<p>The game's first season added the Fantastic Four to the line-up - which, the mathematicians amongst you may notice, is actually double the anticipated rollout speed for new heroes. NetEase have yet to reveal Season 2's offerings - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conspiracy-was-briefly-afoot-in-the-marvel-rivals-community-following-netease-hero-plant-rumours">beware the rumour-mongers</a> - but the game's Gallery Cards suggest that half-vampire Blade is one of the new heroes.</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, than the introduction of new heroes is the addition of new Team-Ups. As the name suggests, these see characters merging their abilities for beaucoup superheroism. I haven't played a lot of Marvel Rivals lately but I'm intrigued by how Team-Ups seem to be serving as a pressure release valve for the balancing. Given the rate at which they're injecting new blood, and given that Marvel's archives harbour thousands of heroes with very mismatched capabilities, NetEase have their work cut out for them ensuring that nobody is either too strong or useless. Team-Ups are helpful here because a weaker hero can still contribute to a match by joining a powerful Team-Up.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are more arcane multiplayer balancing getarounds than this, but I enjoy it regardless. I will attempt to carry on enjoying it when I next sign in and am immediately shredded by a Symbiote Bond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zywoo-passes-s1mple-in-major-counter-strike-milestone.1136856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-passes-s1mple-in-major-counter-strike-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike GOAT debate may never end, but French prodigy Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut has reasserted his case, passing a record held by the one and only Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. However, it could very well be CS2’s fastest rising star that eventually claims the record for himself.</p>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-sets-counter-strike-record-for-most-tournament-mvp-trophies">ZywOo Sets Counter-Strike Record for Most Tournament MVP Trophies</h2>



<p>At ESL Pro League Season 21, Vitality added their second trophy of the year to their case, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming IEM Katowice</a> just a month prior. ZywOo was named MVP of both tournaments by HLTV, bringing his MVP career total to 22, passing s1mple’s record of 2021. </p>



<p>To put in perspective how dominant s1mple was in his prime, his most recent MVP award was from IEM Cologne 2022. He hasn’t won an MVP award in more than two years, while ZywOo has won a staggering nine since the start of 2023, and only now has the French superstar finally passed s1mple. S1mple still owns the record for most MVP awards won in a single year, after winning eight in 2021, the same year where he finally won the Major. Both s1mple and ZywOo are also tied with just a single Major win, but ZywOo is in the better position to win a second considering how dominant Vitality is looking to start 2025.</p>



<p>“I’m one ahead of s1mple,” ZywOo <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/41218/zywoo-i-wont-stop-just-because-i-am-one-in-front-of-s1mple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told HLTV</a> after winning ESL Pro League Season 21. “I will just keep going, keep grinding, and I will never stop just because I am one in front. I will just show I can go 25, 30 MVPs.”</p>



<p>Right now s1mple’s career is at a crossroads. The 27-year-old is still officially on the NAVI bench, and hasn’t played in a professional match since November during his loan to Falcons. Either ZywOo will set a standard so high that no one will catch it, or a new contender for GOAT status will emerge. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2s-biggest-superstar-donk-dazzles-in-first-match-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The player many are watching out for is Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</a>, the rising star of Team Spirit, after a 2024 rookie campaign that saw him win a record-breaking Major and five MVP awards. Still, even if he maintains the pace he set last year, it will take him years to catch up to ZywOo’s record, and that’s assuming the French star stops winning. And given that he’s still only 24, I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>



<p>Will any player ever catch ZywOo’s MVP numbers? Is he the GOAT of Counter-Strike? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"I think there's such a rich lore to that game that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what are the chances the Bioshock movie actually gets made? In July last year, producer Roy Lee said that, following leadership changes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-film-is-still-in-the-works-but-is-being-reconfigured-sdcc-2024">the video-game-to-movie BioShock adaptation had been “reconfigured,” resulting in a “more personal” film</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee said some of the changes came from lower budgets from Netflix. Details about the BioShock movie’s plot have not been revealed, so it’s unclear what it would have looked like before the shift. Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-movie-has-its-director"><u>attached to direct</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Lee said at the time. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quaid’s comments on BioShock come alongside an admission that he looks a lot like video game action star Max Payne, whose likeness is based on Remedy writer Sam Lake. Indeed, there are shots from Quaid’s new action movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/novocaine-2025">Novocaine</a> that have caused fans to wonder if it’s a Max Payne movie in disguise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Live action Max Payne. Seems so real so worth it. This is Max Payne. You got me watching this now. Even the woman looks like the woman from Max Payne 2 lol. The resemblance is almost as if NovoCaine characters (basically is) by the same actor (Jack Quad looking like Sam Lake) <a href="https://t.co/kawh2C1B2n" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kawh2C1B2n</a></p>— Adam Owns 6 (@AdamOwns6) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamOwns6/status/1900843671651557849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, it seems Quaid is less familiar with Max Payne, which is currently getting the remake treatment from Remedy in a deal with original publisher and rights holder Rockstar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've seen people say that I look like Max Payne, and when I've looked at the box art, even I did a double-take," Quaid continued. "I love Rockstar's games, but unfortunately I've never played that one - it's next on the list, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from Bioshock, Quaid loves FromSoftware games. In the same Reddit AMA, Quaid said he loved the challenge presented by the likes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm a huge video game nerd,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j8e1wm/comment/mhexakq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “And lately I've been diving headfirst into the FromSoftware library. I beat Bloodborne, then I beat Sekiro, and now I'm going full boar into Elden Ring. Actually, the thing I use Reddit the most for is tips and tricks on beating Fromsoft's bosses. I love how challenging the games are - it took me a while to get into them, but now I'm obsessed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-fans-notice-a-neat-detail-hidden-in-the-eyes-of-its-final-boss<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Little details can add a lot of character when it comes to the many monsters of Capcom's Monster Hunter series. When it comes to one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' biggest battles, eagle-eyed players have noticed one tiny detail that lends credence to a running theory. It's all in the eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the final boss and story of Monster Hunter Wilds' low rank campaign follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After fighting through the roster of Monster Hunter Wilds' fearsome foes, including the souped-up Guardians, you'll eventually come face-to-face with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Zoh_Shia">Zoh Shia</a>. This enemy is the final bout for low-rank Hunters to clear in Wilds, and it's a doozy. It also might feel a little familiar, if you've played some past Monster Hunter games, and that seems pretty intentional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/some_rather_disturbing_implications_have_emerged/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j8gv1g/interesting_details_about_zoh_shia/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users</a> have pointed out that Zoh Shia's eyes bear a striking resemblance to Fatalis'. Fatalis is an infamous and powerful species of dragon in Monster Hunter's universe, able to raze kingdoms and cause mass devastation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a neat, tiny detail you might have missed in all the chaos of battling Zoh Shia, but it's also not the only signifier pointing towards a link to Fatalis. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzo4wa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one replier pointed out</a>, many aspects of the Zoh Shia fight share similarities with Fatalis bouts. The monster has moves from Black, White, and Crimson Fatalis, and has other small cosmetic similarities like its horns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zoh Shia also draws on other classic, terrifying monsters — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzr8ws/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some more here, in this reply</a> — Fatalis definitely seems like a core touchstone. What does it ultimately mean, though?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, keep in mind Zoh Shia is a created monster. And if Zoh Shia was made to combat something or counter a threat, what kind of threat would be countered by a Fatalis-like monster? It opens up a lot of fun theorycrafting for where Monster Hunter Wilds' assumed expansion could go. Most importantly, this connection teases that there are even bigger, badder monsters to contend with further down the line.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It might be a while until Monster Hunter Wilds theory-crafters see their guesses pan out or not, though. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-gets-early-april-release-date-adds-an-endgame-hub-for-players-to-gather">next big update will be in April</a>, which will bring some more hunts to the title alongside other additions, like an endgame hunter hub. So for now, best to just get your rank up high and be prepared for whatever kind of monster awaits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game. We’ve also got a detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds walkthrough</a> in progress, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Multiplayer_Guide_-_Crossplay,_Link_Parties_and_More">Monster Hunter Wilds multiplayer</a> guide to explain how to play with friends, and if you’ve played one of the open betas, here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Transfer_Beta_Character_Creator_Data">how to transfer your Monster Hunter Wilds Beta character</a> over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> returned an 8/10.

            <p>
A fresh version of Nintendo's iconic GameCube controller looks to be in development for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
The evidence here comes from a recent FCC filing for a Switch 2 controller with an oddly-located product label - that matches the location of the product label on a GameCube controller. 
</p>
<p>
The filing, for a Switch 2 peripheral with the product code BEE-021, matches other Switch 2 components with the same BEE prefix, and does not appear to be a new Switch 2 Pro controller. 
</p>
<p>
Evidence dug up by <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/new-fcc-filing-discovered-that-looks-a-lot-like-a-gamecube-nso-controller.12879/#post-1660543">Famiboards</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/switch-2-gamecube-controller-rumours-resurface-following-new-nintendo-filing">Nintendo Life</a>) points to the fact this device lacks NFC support - something included in Switch 1 Pro controllers and Joy-Con - but does include wireless Bluetooth, something included in past Nintendo Switch Online pads. 
</p>
<p>
The suggestion, then, is that Nintendo is prepping a GameCube controller re-release in the same way it has done for other retro controllers, such as the N64. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2025-03-17-163141.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Take a leap of logic further, and the supposed existence of this controller could also point to GameCube support for Nintendo Switch Online... but one thing at a time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's brilliant GameCube controller and its wonderful Wavebird counterpart are now nearly two decades old, but are still beloved by many fans - indeed, the pads are still a preferred method of control for many hardcore Super Smash Bros players. 
</p>
<p>
Just a few weeks remain until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo properly lifts the lid on its Switch 2 plans at the start of April</a>. Could we see GameCube Switch Online support announced at the same time?

It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-950335"></span></p><p>“While <em>Missile Command Delta</em> approaches gameplay in a completely new way, it retains all the tension and suspense of the arcade original,” said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a press release. “You have to think strategically about every move you make because even one poor choice can have grave consequences.”</p><p>Stearns continued, “<em>Missile Command Delta</em> has a little something for every kind of player—whether you love strategy tactics games, are a mystery fan, a secret hunting completionist, or you just love to explore and solve puzzles. We can’t wait for players to get their hands on the game later this year.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><em>Missile Command Delta</em> reimagines Atari’s 1980s missile defense arcade classic as a turn-based tactical game set against a mysterious narrative that leaves you questioning whether you’re trapped in a simulation or truly defending cities from attack.</p><p>As players explore an abandoned half-century old facility they will encounter locked doors, dishevelled work rooms, massive super computers and newly awakened missile command terminals. Players must defend against waves of missiles from an unknown enemy using a battery of missiles, each with its own unique type, range, and explosion size. Only by managing their arsenal carefully will they have enough firepower to clear the skies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As enemy attacks increase and pressure mounts, relationships will be put to the test, blurring the lines between what is real and who they can trust. If they succeed, they may even learn the truth behind this Cold War defense program.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Missile Command Delta - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qj11h_CjmTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Johnny's "integration into the Mortal Kombat story and universe is a big part of what this movie explores," NetherRealm's Ed Boon told <a href="https://ew.com/mortal-kombat-2-first-look-karl-urban-johnny-cage-kitana-shao-kahn-exclusive-11696968">EW</a>. "He's a washed-up Hollywood guy thrown into this magical, ultra-violent thing. Karl, his depiction of Johnny Cage is different than our games in some ways.</p>
<p>"He's adding his own flare to it, but I think it'll feel fresh. There's like a novelty factor in there."</p>
<p>Boon added Johnny's introduction in the film is "ridiculously hilarious", with the game developer stating his debut incited "some of the biggest laughs" during the film's early screenings.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 2's director Simon McQuoid said the movie team "wanted a character that wasn't just completely silly, comic book… It's a character that could instantly go there and become too light and throwaway if we were to lean too much into the kind of cheese".</p>
<p>The director believes Urban's casting has "allowed that character to have more depth".</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and has been cast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>

<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it "boring".</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So all that said, I feel worried, and not worried about Guerilla specifically, or <em>Horizon</em>, or my performance, or my career specifically even, I feel worried about this art form, game performance as an art form.”</p><p>Burch explained how SAG-AFTRA, of which she’s a member, has been on strike with many of the biggest video game companies—including Activision, Electronic Arts, and others—over AI protections, and pointed to the Aloy tech demo as a perfect example of what the group is fighting for. Burch noted that the performance rules the actors are asking companies to sign onto have already been agree to by others in various interim agreements. </p><p>“I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s face, or voice, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight that person would have no recourse, they wouldn’t have any protections, and way to fight back, and that possibility makes me so sad, it breaks my heart, it scares me,” she said. </p><p> “We have proposed a deal that includes...industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” a spokesperson Audrey Cooling of the game company bargaining group said in a statement last week. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p><p>Burch suggested it’s not enough. “The technology isn’t the problem, game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem,” she continued in her video. “We’re on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections. I support the strike, I’ve always supported the strike, I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A first look at classic Mortal Kombat characters in the upcoming movie has been revealed. In a new exclusive from Entertainment Weekly, Warner Bros. Pictures has released the first look at Johnny Cage, Kitana, and Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat 2.</p>



<p>Johnny Cage will be played by Karl Urban from The Boys. Resident Evil star Adeline Rudolph plays Kitana while House of David actor Martyn Ford is Shao Kahn.</p>



<p>You can check out the new characters below (click to enlarge).</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 2 is the follow up to 2021’s Mortal Kombat. After the first move followed Shang Tsung’s goal of killing Earth’s fighters before the tournament began, the sequel is where the tournament happens. Earth is at risk of losing its 10th-straight tournament. Should that happen, Shao Kahn will invade the planet and take over.</p>



<p>In addition to the tournament itself, franchise co-creator Ed Boon says that the battle between Scorpion and Sub-Zero isn’t finished.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“He’s certainly making appearances that are significant and necessary for the progress of other storylines,” Boon told <a href="https://ew.com/mortal-kombat-2-first-look-karl-urban-johnny-cage-kitana-shao-kahn-exclusive-11696968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “He plays a different role. He’s not part of the ‘Super Friends’ trying to defeat Shao Kahn, but his appearance is key and it is very essential for certain parts.”</p>



<p>And though they’ve given fans a look at three new characters coming in Mortal Kombat 2, they aren’t the only ones that will find themselves on the big screen. Jade and Queen Sindel will also play a role in the movie along with “other” characters that haven’t been announced yet.</p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 2 is scheduled to release in theaters on October 24.</p>

            <p>We've been working on something that we hope you'll love -- especially if you're the kind of gamer who has a wishlist longer than a Final Fantasy cutscene (guilty as charged).</p>
<p>Starting today, you can link your Steam account to your Gamer Network ID and get email alerts for articles about games in your Steam library and wishlist.</p>
<h2>So, what does that mean?</h2>
<p><a href="https://id.gamer.network/account/following/steam?publication=rockpapershotgun">Linking your Steam account</a> means we'll know which games you play or are interested in. Then, you can set your account to follow the games in your Steam libary -- and whenever we publish news, reviews, guides, interviews, or updates about those specific games, we'll email you about it.</p>
<p>No more scrolling through pages of articles hunting for that one bit of info about your favourite upcoming indie title or the latest patch for your go-to multiplayer game. If it's in your library or on your wishlist, we've got you covered.</p>

		<p>That wind I was worried about for the skeleton? It never showed up on Friday. Instead, it was a very pleasant day spent, as predicted, drinking beers on a friend's porch. It ruled. But then I came back home, nodded off on the couch, and woke up to <em>a goddamn nightmare</em> outside of my house. The winds were terrifying, and I saw my skeleton swaying like he was about to taken to Oz. So, at 2AM, I rushed outside and ripped my boy down to the ground. I ended soaking wet, but Jackson Bones is thankfully safe, and he's happy upright now in St. Patrick's Day gear.</p><p>-pk, who started watching <em>Adolescence </em>on Netflix and is worried</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – This one is a doozy, and features our old friend/colleague/boss, Emanuel Maiberg.

But you might not want to buy a house after you hear this harrowing story.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> — Apologies, this came together late last week, and now that we're publishing more articles lately, it made sense to push this back a few days.

The film was originally meant to be exclusive to Max and Cartoon Network before receiving a limited release from Ketchup Entertainment in December, followed by a wider release this month. This makes it the first fully animated film to be released in theaters in the franchise’s nearly 100-year history, but fans have reported nearly empty theater screenings.
