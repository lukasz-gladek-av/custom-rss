            <p>The Terra Nil team has released its first major update, known as Vita Nova, across PC and Netflix. A Switch version is also on its way.</p>
<p>Today's update for the environmental strategy game is free, and includes a number of new levels, such as Polluted Bay and Scorched Caldera. </p>
<p>The Terra Nil team describe Polluted Bay as a "dead landscape carved in half by a badly polluted river". Scorched Caldera, on the other hand, is a "vast volcanic crater that you must terraform into a life-filled freshwater lake". </p>

<p>In addition to new levels, Vita Nova has brought improvements to the map, with the developer stating that along with being 3D, it can now be freely rotated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team said the overhauled wildlife system - which it describes as "dramatic" - will allow the transformed landscapes to "feel more alive than ever". This means animals such as the newly introduced jaguar will venture out more naturally, and have "a deeper set of needs to fulfil". </p>
<p>Nine new buildings have also been added to the game thanks to this update. You can check out a trailer for Vita Nova in the video above.</p>

<p>"Even where Terra Nil makes choices I don't always enjoy, I enjoy that it does make these novel, ambitious choices," Ruth Cassidy wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terra-nil-review-an-intricate-ecosystem-of-puzzles">Eurogamer's Terra Nil review</a>.</p>
<p>"More than simply the gentle vibes it seems to suggest on the surface, Terra Nil offers engaging puzzles, a thorough commitment to what an environmental city builder could look like, and lingering moments of actual perfection."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184700/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-gaming-headset-tapo-mini-smart-plugs-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve run through an alarming number of gaming headsets over the years from almost every brand you can think of — including Razer, Turtle Beach, HyperX, Logitech, and Corsair — but none impressed me more than SteelSeries’. Its latest high-end set is the <strong>Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</strong>, and while not cheap, you can get a refurbished model at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headset">Woot</a> until the end of June with a 90-day warranty for $179.99 ($170 off the MSRP).</p><p>SteelSeries headsets are widely lauded for their comfort, well-balanced audio, great mic quality, and sleek design. You can get most of these benefits from the brand’s more affordable options since they typically use similar drivers and microphones, but the Nova Pro Wireless is ideal for multiplatform gamers. Its dual USB base allows you to connect it to both your PC and PlayStation 5 (another <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=theverge02-20">version specifically supports Xbox</a>, but there’s no equivalent sale right now), and it features Bluetooth support for the Nintendo Switch and various mobile devices. You can even use a USB source and Bluetooth simultaneously. </p><p>The base station has a monochromatic OLED display that makes it easy to see which mode you’re in, manage volume levels and chat mix, and fiddle with the EQ, all of which you can control from the headset if you don’t feel like getting up to use the knob. That’s also where you’ll charge the spare battery it comes with, which I personally think is the secondary killer feature. You can pop the removable battery out and swap in a fresh one from the base — no tethering required.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">Read our SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset supports active noise cancellation, swappable batteries, Bluetooth support, and compatibility with PC and most consoles — including Switch and PlayStation.

There’s a rich story and a ton to do outside of its engaging combat, too, whether you’re running up the scoreboards at arcades, singing a round of karaoke, or putting in extra hours on the fun jobs you can take. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055072/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-yakuza-sega">Read our review</a>.</li><li>A three-pack of <strong>TP-Link’s Matter-ready Tapo Mini Smart Wi-Fi Plugs </strong>is available for just $24.99 ($25 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXMNJDW3?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.store.tp-link.com%2Fproducts%2Ftp-link-tapo-matter-compatible-smart-plug-mini-15a-1800w-tapo-p125m%3Fvariant%3D44382110286047">TP-Link</a>, which matches its all-time low. Smart plugs are ideal if you’re starting a smart home makeover, as they allow you to remotely schedule and control the power on older devices plugged in to them. Their support for the newer Matter protocol also means they offer seamless control from your preferred smart home platform, whether that’s Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599437/tp-link-tapo-p125m-review-matter-apple-amazon-google-smartthings">Read our review</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868860/blue-yeti-x-usb-microphone-live-streamers-blend-led-metering"><strong>Blue Yeti X</strong></a> is down to $129.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QKQJL17?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmwWttm3MoQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBlue-Yeti-X-Professional-USB-Condenser-Microphone-PC-Mac-Gaming-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-Desktop-Mic-High-Res-Metering-LED-Lighting-VO-CE-Effec%2F286303156">Walmart</a>. Although there are more attractive options with more impressive acoustics, the Logitech-owned Blue microphones are solid for podcasting, music, and content creation. They can be a little sensitive, and you may find it a challenge to dial in the perfect gain, but it’s easier to find that sweet spot on the Yeti X thanks to a built-in LED gain meter. Its multifunction knob lets you adjust levels, mute the mic, and set your preferred polar pickup pattern. You can also engage other helpful features, such as a “blend” mode that helps you find an ideal balance between your voice and whichever audio source you’re speaking over.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>.</p>

<p>The Rocket League World Cup will run later this year as part of FIFA’s wider ‘FIFAe’ effort to break into the world of esports, which their website tells me they’ve been attempting to do since a FIFA Interactive World Cup held in 2004. Nowadays that consists of online competitions played across EA Sports FC, Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/efootball-2024">eFootball</a> and Rocket League, which already runs its Championship Series through the initiative.</p>
<p>The upcoming World Cup will see 16 nations face off in a global tournament, with each country able to put forward three players and one substitute as their representatives on the pitch. The participating nations will be selected through a combination of their player base - in other words, how many people play Rocket League - and based on the past performance of their fellow local players in Rocket League competitions. Those countries will also have the chance to run local-level tournaments to help find their nation’s top players.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>“The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA’s member associations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles,” FIFA’s director of eFootball and gaming Christian Volk said in a statement that, despite their job title, really reads like someone who had never heard of Rocket League before someone burst into their office and pointed at a big number. Volk topped off that statement with one of the most teeth-grinding corporate taglines I’ve come across in a while: “This milestone partnership highlights our commitment to evolve our football esports ecosystem and continue to build the biggest stages for all communities to fame their game.”</p>
<p>Anyway, Rocket League remains a great game that’s almost as much fun to watch as it is to play, so I’m genuinely more interested in its esports tournaments than many games. If you reckon you’re good enough to represent your country in the upcoming World Cup, you can go sign up for qualification <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/register/player">over on the FIFAe site</a>.</p>

Rewild 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> has just received a free Vita Nova update, which introduces five new levels, nine buildings, a spinnable 3D world map, a new creature, the jaguar, and a more sophisticated wildlife system (that’ll be the “new life” in question, then). It endows the game’s hitherto rather decorative fauna with “deeper needs” and greater agency. Find a trailer peering through the reeds below this sentence like a jaguar slavering over an unsuspecting herd of boar. Yes, you’re the wild boar in this analogy. Run piggy, run!

If you missed Terra Nil, it’s about clearing desolate regions of detritus and pollutants and bringing back the vegetation by plonking down fancy rewilding gadgets, each of which requires biopower produced by the map tiles you restore. The new maps include Polluted Bay, in which you have to work around an utterly foul river, and Scorched Caldera, a volcano you must turn into a lake. “These, and all the new maps in the Vita Nova update, will put your reclamation skills to the test in interesting and unusual ways,” notes the press release. 
</p>
<p>
The accompanying wildlife system “adds a new dimension of strategy to the game”, with animals emerging “more naturally” in response to your restoration of the terrain. You can also nudge them about by constructing land bridges and even indirectly cultivate prey populations for predators. I’m not sure how “deep” it is in practice. It sounds like it’ll be enjoyable finding out.
</p>
<p>
But will it be enjoyable enough to offset the drawbacks identified by Hayden Hefford (RPS in peace) in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/terra-nil-review">Terra Nil review</a> last year? “It certainly feels refreshing in the citybuilding genre, which is so often focused on creating infinite growth and bustling metropolises, nature be damned, but ultimately, it's still a game about chasing numbers, and filling meters that allow you to progress,” Hayden wrote. “That alone could be comforting, some much needed calm in a busy world as you create a lush landscape, but I found its repetitive nature was more frustrating than relaxing.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve only ever played a pre-release version of Terra Nil, but I’ve interviewed developers Free Lives and they seem like a kind bunch. One thing we talked about in that interview was whether the developers might introduce human beings to the setting, living alongside the nonhuman creatures and involving themselves in the restoration process, rather than having everything hinge on the usage of shiny SimGadgets. Terra Nil is a charming game and a pleasant reprieve from climate crisis angst, but I've always found the absence of humans from its setting a bit hopeless. There's an unintended, but unfortunate parallel with <a href="https://anthrocology.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/unearthing-the-colonial-roots-of-rewilding/">how real-life rewilding projects may exclude indigenous people from their ancestral lands</a>.

<p id="L8sEsi"><strong>Description:</strong> “Enhances spontaneous guard in mixed physick.”</p>
<p id="NdnB90"><strong>Location:</strong> The Deflecting Hardtear can be acquired from a Furnace Golem in <strong>Gravesite Plain</strong>, likely the first Furnace Golem that you’ll encounter when you step into the DLC.</p>
<p id="K8YUlY"><strong>Effect:</strong> With Deflecting Hardtear in your Wondrous Physick, “damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.” In other words, if you perfectly time your blocks (à la <em>Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice</em>’s deflection mechanic), you’ll be able to react better in battle.</p>

Case closed, gang.” While he did not name Beahm directly, the former Twitch icon who now streams on YouTube was understood to be the target of the allegations, and the tweet immediately went viral.</p><p>Online media personality Jake Lucky was one of the major accounts to recirculate the allegations and connect them directly to Beahm. “Jake seriously...I get it, its a hot topic but this has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract,” Beahm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> back. </p><p>The fact that the denial didn’t directly engage with the new allegations only inflamed the situation, with accounts flocking to the exchange to dunk on Beahm’s “no wrongdoing was acknowledged” corporate-speak.

This person, who remained anonymous but reportedly worked on Twitch’s trust and safety team at the time of the ban, told <em>The Verge</em> that “Beahm had used Whispers, Twitch’s now-defunct messaging system, to exchange messages with a minor and initiate a conversation about meeting up at TwitchCon.”</p><h2 id="h668"><a id=""></a>Why the Dr Disrespect saga is so hard to unravel</h2><p>At 1:00 a.m. the day after Beahm’s ban, internet insider Rod “Slasher” Breslau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Slasher/status/1276742960286183424&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1276742960286183424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> the following: “for several hours now I have been told from credible sources the reason DrDisrespect has been banned. however due to the importance and sensitivity around the subject I have refrained from going on it. i don’t feel comfortable with it currently.”</p><p>Breslau’s track-record for insider connections at Twitch and in the greater content creator community made people take note, and the cryptic framing went on to be perfect fodder for speculation and conspiracy theories. It seemed to suggest that something so allegedly bad that had happened the nobody with direct knowledge could even talk about it. Four years later, Breslau stood by his original tweet in the wake of Conners’ new allegations. “I didn’t lie,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Slasher/status/1804321712219013293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1804321712219013293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a post on Substack</a></span>, Mikhail Klimentov, the former <em>Washington Post Launcher </em>editor who brokered its 2020 interview with Beahm following the ban, outlined why all the reporting on the controversy has produced so few firm answers and whether that will ever change. In it, Breslau told Klimentov that his extended break from the internet in 2022 was due in part to the Dr Disrespect ban and his tweet about it. “i cannot continue my professional career until i release a story about doc,” Breslau told Klimentov in a private message at the time. </p><p>Fans of Beahm, meanwhile, dug up three of Conners’ old tweets showing him using alleged knowledge of the ban to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to fill seats for his bands’ tour dates</a></span>. Many have also raised questions about why, if Conners had this alleged information for years, he didn’t disclose it previously. The former Twitch employee addressed both things in a follow-up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter-thread on June 23</a></span>. </p><p>“Those three tweets warrant admonishment,” he wrote. “Maybe more than three—the stans trying to dig stuff up have been so underwhelming that I presume they missed something. I apologize for it all because it’s worth apologize for.  The subtext of the bit, again shame worthy, is that you’re the last person to not know.”</p><p> Conners continued:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The information had been so normalized, declawed in the circles that I ran in that could be reduced to allusion and entendre. For everyone who has since said “that’s fucked”—I agreed with you on Friday night before you wrote it. I should have agreed with you sooner.  I cannot take it back but I can stop it.   I never said I’m a perfect person. I just hope this class grades on a curve.<br></p><p> That said, I’m the least sued I’ve ever been. Guys, lawyers work weekends. I don’t think they had a few things they just needed to get to before they circled back to this.  I’m also a little irked at Jake who is very clearly trying to split the difference with what he thinks is half of his potential audience but also I deserve to feel bad about the things he’s flagged. I just do. </p><p>But I also know Jake is racing to verify that screenshot from the world’s leader in multiplayer entertainment’s is legit—Enforcement ID: 7278926—and things are dragging on. Knowing who I was racing I would probably put out some content too.<br></p></blockquote><p>The last part of his message alluded to what may be the alleged screenshots of Twitch’s investigation that led to Beahm getting banned in the first place. Whether they are real or will ever become public is the question that’s been facing this entire saga from the start. Beahm returned to YouTube on Monday for his first livestream of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>’s massively popular <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC.<br></p><p>“For those that are looking for me to expand on this weekend, not gonna,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the opening of the playthrough</a></span>. “I already said what I needed to say. I don’t give a fuck about this guy. That’s it.” From there Beahm thanked his fans for their donations and messages of support, before pivoting into playing his Wordle match for the day. “We got you all day, baby,” viewers wrote in the chat. </p><p>Twitch, Beahm, and Conners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breslau declined to comment. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>From Software game difficulty chat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">is in full swing</a> following the release of Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC, but cannier Soulslikers such as myself and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/what-are-hidetaka-miyazakis-favorite-fromsoftware-games-now-that-elden-ring-is-finished-dark-souls-and-bloodborne-left-a-very-big-impression-the-president-says/">GR</a>’s Hirun Cryer are already leaping and bounding ahead to the next Stage of Review Discourse: which From Software game is bestest? Here to settle the matter once and for all until the next time we post about it is company president Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-getting-patch-with-new-hairstyles-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/">CNET</a> to say which of the From Software games he’s worked on is his “favourite child”, Miyazaki correctly answered “first Dark Souls and Bloodborne”. Truly, the perfect reply. Interviewer David Lumb has presumably now retired from journalism, for there are no more worlds to conquer. The only way it would be better is if Miyazaki had added "which is coming to PC soon". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">He's definitely up for a Bloodborne PC port</a>, musing earlier this month that “any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past.” The onus is on Bloodborne's publisher Sony, it seems, to give the project the greenlight.</p>
<p>Ever the diplomat, Miyazaki qualified his initial response with "of course, I love them all". But grotty old Lordran and Yharnam are the gameworlds he appears to look back on mostly fondly, inasmuch as anybody looks fondly at a Souls game, even if they haven't reached quite as many people as From's later works. "On a very personal level, I would say, first Dark Souls and Bloodborne left a very big impression on me,” Miyazaki told CNET. "As a company, Elden Ring put us in a completely different league, so that was a huge milestone for the company."</p>
<p>As for From Software games Miyazaki hasn't worked on, he singled out 1995 action-RPG King's Field 2 for praise (a little surprisingly, he didn’t mention Armored Core). I like King’s Field games myself. There’s a rich vein of latter-day retro indie dungeon crawlers inspired by the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">Lunacid is a recent doozie</a>.</p>
<p>We haven’t ever published a list of the best From Software games, possibly because doing so would be akin to making a shark-diving cage out of mackerel, but we have done a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">the best Soulslikes</a>. It was last refreshed in 2021, and could probably do with an update.</p>
<p>
I have been trying to think of an elegant way to mention that Miyazaki has an actual child <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">and that being a father might influence his future games</a>, but I am now tired and irritable. Please just pretend I have cleverly inserted this bit into one of the paragraphs above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-to-finally-let-players-drink-potions-as-a-bonus-action-in-one-dd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons players will finally be able to drink potions as a Bonus Action in One D&amp;D, meaning the popular homebrew and Baldur's Gate 3 mechanic is becoming an official rule in the next iteration of the game.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-makes-popular-homebrew-rule-official-in-2024-core-rulebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic Book</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBnLlqV0Z0&amp;t=71s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> from D&amp;D game designers Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins walked fans through some changes to the Player's Handbook, which will be refreshed for the first time in more than a decade in 2024, including the long-requested ability to have a cheeky heal as a Bonus Action.</p><p>Crawford specifically said that health potions can be used as a Bonus Action in One D&amp;D — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-announces-updated-core-rulebook-release-dates-but-not-all-of-them-arrive-in-2024">which arrives beginning September 17, 2024 with the Player's Handbook</a> but won't launch fully until the Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual arrive on November 12, 2024 and February 18, 2025 respectively — but it's unclear if the rule change will apply to other potions too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual Cover Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>As a health potion can theoretically be drank at the same speed as any other kind of potion, however, it would certainly make sense for the Bonus Action rule to affect all of the magic smoothies. The current 5th Edition of D&amp;D forces players to use a potion as a full Action, meaning players miss a turn of doing potentially more interesting things if they need to heal.</p><p>Using potions as a Bonus Action has long been a popular mechanic in players' homebrew or home rules though, and even Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">the hit D&amp;D video game which follows most of 5th Edition's rules</a>, let players drink them as a Bonus Action.</p><p>The release of the updated rules, meaning the transition from 5th Edition to One D&amp;D, comes alongside the tabletop role-playing game's 50th anniversary. Publisher Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizkids-is-celebrating-dds-50th-anniversary-with-its-biggest-miniature-booster-set-ever">the biggest miniature booster set ever to celebrate</a>, and has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-look-at-the-dungeons-dragons-2024-monster-manual-cover">slowly but surely sharing tidbits of information</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-2024-core-rulebooks-are-up-for-preorder">the new set of core rulebooks</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-on-xbox-series-s-can-run-at-60fps-thanks-to-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">recently added a 60 frames per second option to Starfield on Xbox Series X</a> but left the Xbox Series S version out in the cold. Thankfully modders have stepped in to save the day, as they so often do.</p><p>As verified by the tech wizards at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Starfield on the less-powerful Xbox Series S can now be played at 30fps thanks to mods (search for ‘Series S' under the mod menu). Using mods, Digital Foundry found Starfield on Xbox Series S hit a baseline of 60fps even on challenging GPU-limited areas of the game,  such as heavily populated cities, with some less-demanding areas rising to 90fps.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that playing Starfield on Xbox Series S in this way drops the resolution to 1280x720 from 1600x900. "We seem to be finding the limits of FSR 2 upscaling quality, with some ugly artefacting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-starfield-mods-unlock-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-s-so-how-well-does-it-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry reports</a>. "Even so, you are getting a viable performance mode — it's just that the trades are far more obvious to the eye than the Series X version."</p><p>The inevitable next question is that if modders can get Starfield running at 60fps, why hasn’t Bethesda? Digital Foundry said the reduced resolution that comes with such improved frame-rate performance means “Starfield simply isn't a particularly attractive game at this point.” Bethesda, Digital Foundry suggests, may not feel this trade-off presents Starfield in as good a light as it requires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield May Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Starfield’s performance on Xbox Series S may not be front of mind for Bethesda in any case. Last week, Bethesda Game Studios chief Todd Howard responded to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-starfield-steam-reviews-plunge-to-mostly-negative-todd-howard-responds-to-paid-mods-backlash">backlash over Starfield paid mods</a>, confirming the developer would take a look at its pricing model for Creations content.</p><p>On Steam, Starfield’s recent user review rating fell to ‘Mostly Negative’ after disgruntled players hit out at Bethesda for charging $7 for a single Starfield mission. The second mission of the recently released Trackers Alliance is only available as a Starfield Creation and costs $7, or 700 credits.</p><p>Looking further ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Howard has confirmed plans to release a second story expansion for Starfield</u></a> following this year’s Shattered Space, and commented on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>the long development of The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-details-including-new-questline-requirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard has announced plans to run a second Public Test Realm for action role-playing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, this time for Season 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-public-test-realm-lets-players-try-season-4-early">Diablo 4’s first PTR</a> ran in April and let Battle.net PC players play the well-received Season 4 early. Similarly, the Season 5 PTR gives fans a taste of what’s to come June 25 to July 2 for players with a PC Battle.net account only.</p><p>“The purpose of the PTR is to test updates and features before the launch of Season 5,” Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “Then we’ll make adjustments to Season 5 using your feedback before it goes live for everyone. The feedback we receive helps us to fine-tune balance changes, eliminate bugs, and create the best experience possible. Having a PTR gives us a chance to test new systems, and we’re grateful for your time spent playing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what to expect from the PTR, there’s a new questline that takes place after the events of the main questline and presumably leads into the events of Diablo 4’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, which launches October 8, 2024. “Season 5 features a new story where enemies are cut-down, alliances shift, and unlikely friends emerge from the shadows,” Blizzard teased.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you’ll need to head to Hawezar in World Tier 3 and “investigate a disturbance amongst the cityfolk there” in order to trigger the questline. The World Tier 3 requirement means you’ll need to have completed the campaign and crossed over from World Tier 2 by defeating that difficulty’s Cathedral of Light capstone.</p><p>Completing this new questline lets you battle the Infernal Hordes, the new gameplay activity coming with Season 5. Infernal Hordes features seemingly endless waves of enemies, which grow more powerful with each passing day. It sounds very much like a Diablo 4 take on a wave-based rogue-lite: the Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards.</p><p>Elsewhere, Season 5 introduces new Legendaries, Uniques, and items. There are quality-of-life updates to endgame bosses, too. Diablo 4 Season 5, which does not have a name yet, launches August 6.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR Patch Notes:</h2><p><strong>1.5.0 PTR Build #55051 (PC)</strong> - June 25, 2024</p><h2>GAME UPDATES</h2><h3>New Items and Tempering Recipes</h3>All Classes<p><strong>Tempering Recipes</strong></p><p>Worldly Finesse - Offensive</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>+X% Critical Strike Damage</li><li>+X% Vulnerable Damage</li><li>+X% Overpower Damage</li><li>+X% Ultimate Damage</li></ul>Barbarian<p><strong>Unique Items</strong></p><p>Unbroken Chain - Amulet</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Casting Steel Grasp reduces Iron Maelstrom’s Cooldown by 5-10 seconds.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-together-is-steams-latest-surprise-hit.909819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, the stars align and a game manages to rack up tens of thousands of players on Steam, seemingly from out of nowhere. Such is the case with&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, a new platformer that asks you to climb out of the depths of hell.</p>
<p>Since its release last Wednesday,&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been rocketing up the Steam charts, and unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular">definitely-not-a-scam "game"&nbsp;<em>Banana</em></a>, this one doesn't seem to be offering any kind of financial incentive to its players.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a physics platformer that's all about climbing out of hell, and it can be tackled either by yourself or with up to three friends in local multiplayer. If you ask me, though, it rather seems like&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been built around co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=NFFxZ6bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=9ELkVgR_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Together</em>&nbsp;is rocketing up the Steam charts.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not entirely clear what's behind&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>'s meteoric (and entirely appropriate, given the subject matter) rise, but absent any kind of artificial boost, a number of factors could be at play here.</p>
<p>The game has a pretty low price point; at time of writing, it's available for $4.49, which is only a 10% discount on its usual price of $4.99. That's a solid price for any group of friends looking to take a punt on a new co-op experience.</p>
<p>It's also a simple, straightforward game in the vein of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed"><em>Human: Fall Flat</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/popular-indie-game-only-up-suddenly-removed-from-steam"><em>Only Up!</em></a>, and it doesn't appear to offer any kind of microtransactions or live-service elements, which may well be refreshing for those looking for a multiplayer game devoid of such things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=detJPyg5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=jxbaF0af 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of moment is probably why&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is popular.</figcaption></figure><p>There is also, of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is a pretty good game to stream; it's got plenty of laugh-out-loud emergent moments, and going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its Steam reviews</a>, it's also a great way to get angry at your friends, which never fails to shift a few copies.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">grab it right now on PC via Steam</a>. It's only a few dollars, so it's almost certainly worth an hour or two of your time at the very least.</p>

        <p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>EU regulators have opened a new investigation following claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">Apple is not complying with EU rules</a>.</p>
<p>The European Commission – which started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">investigating Apple's alleged non-compliance</a> back in March – has accused Apple of breaching its Digital Markets Act, meaning Apple could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the firm's global annual revenue. That may not sound like much, but when you consider that Apple generates £301bn ($383bn) a year, that's a sizeable punishment.</p>
<p>Any further offences could even see the fine increased to 20 percent.</p>

<p>Apple, Google owner Alphabet, and Facebook owner Meta are all being investigated by the EU under the Digital Market Act (DMA), key legislation designed to keep competition fair.</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google are being investigated over their mobile app stores, which the EU previously ordered must allow greater competition on their respective platforms.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">previously-announced solution to satisfy DMA rules has drawn fire</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">fees and limits, which make launching games or apps outside of the App Store costly</a> – something long-time legal rival Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney called "hot garbage".</p>
<p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA," Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition and digital chief, said in a statement earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/apple-eu-competition-rules/index.html?Date=20240624">CNN</a>), which also confirmed the regulatory body has also opened another investigation into Apple's new contractual requirements that require app developers to pay a "core technology fee" each time their app is installed.</p>
<p>"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers."</p>
<p>In response, Apple said: "All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EaVGEn">The Game of Thrones TV universe has had its fair share of childish, petulant, fair-haired kings. And at first, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2</a><em>’</em>s addition to that lineup, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23379127/house-dragon-kids-are-screwed">Aegon II Targaryen</a> (Tom Glynn-Carney), seemed like he could end up just a slightly less evil rehash of Joffrey, like the series taking its foot off the gas and playing the hits. But in the first two episodes of the season, Aegon has already proven that there’s plenty to separate him from <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ greatest villain. </p>
<p id="H1cccH">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2. It also contains spoilers for <em>Game of Thrones</em>, if that’s somehow a concern for you.]</p>
<p id="pYjAPg">Joffrey is, by necessity, a pretty simple character. In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like">season 2 of <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, when he first really steps into power, the show is introducing half a dozen new factions and twice as many characters. Joffrey’s immature, cruel, violent, impulsive, and generally thoughtless in most of his actions. That isn’t to say his character is bad because it’s simple, just that he fills in a very necessary role. The season is a maelstrom of morally gray characters with Joffrey in the center to give the audience an anchor, like a measuring point to judge the comparative evil of every other king; when everyone else is morally complex, it helps to have a villain to orient ourselves around. </p>
<p id="u3LBUJ">But like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">most of the characters in <em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, Aegon is far more nuanced than his closest <em>Game of Thrones</em> counterpart. </p>

<p id="oLGouw">In his earliest moments this season, Aegon gets a similar setup. We see him at a small council meeting, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405183/house-dragon-review-episode-9-alicent-aegon-rhaenys">acting like a brash child</a>, pushing for war in an instant, furious that anyone would <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/23289499/house-of-the-dragon-aegon-conqueror-prophecy-ice-and-fire-game-of-thrones">question his claim to the throne</a>. But his humanity doesn’t take long to emerge. During his time seeing to the concerns of his lowborn subjects, it becomes clear that Aegon wants to be a good king. He tries to loosen the livestock tax on farmers, only to be told that it would cripple his dragons, and he clearly wants to give the smiths the money they request. Neither of these, as Otto points out, are particularly good decisions. But they’re empathetic and understandable all the same, in a way that Joffrey never could be. </p>
<p id="2EZ72g">In that way, Aegon is more affected by tragedy than Joffrey ever was. In the second episode of the season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">after the death of his son and heir</a>, Aegon is broken in a more nuanced way than <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters ever have been, at least on screen. We see him impulsively call for war and Rhaenyra’s head; we see him kill the former Goldcloak that was caught attempting to ferry his son’s head out of King’s Landing; and we see him cry alone in his room in one of the saddest television scenes in recent memory, made even more poignant by the fact that Alicent simply walks out of the room when she sees this, too sad herself to even confront her son. </p>

<p id="ZTK0L3">It’s all the impetuous restlessness that we saw from Aegon during the first episode’s small council meetings, but manifesting itself though grief instead of boredom. Aegon’s spoiled life distances him from tragedy but doesn’t immunize him to it. So when it comes for him, too, he has no idea what to do with those feelings. It’s deeply, inescapably, and devastatingly human, all in ways that Joffrey never needed to be. And that’s exactly what <em>House of the Dragon</em> needs, with its tangled web of familial conflicts, misunderstandings, and backhanded power grabs. </p>
<p id="zTw6lX">Unsurprisingly, the best summary for the kind of king Aegon II Targaryen is, and how different he is from Joffrey, comes from <em>Game of Thrones</em> itself. In the original series’ second season, Tyrion tells Joffrey that Westeros has had vicious kings and idiot kings, but that Joffrey might be its first vicious idiot king. In Tyrion’s parlance, Aegon is an idiot king. Not the insulting kind of idiot that Tyrion intended, but a tragic kind of idiot. In another time, Aegon could have had a fine enough reign, and that fact alone creates a massive gulf between him and Joffrey, and makes Aegon an even sadder character in the process. </p>

<p>Season 5 of Diablo 4 <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is approaching</a>, and with it comes a brand new survival mode for players to experience. </p>



<p>Known as Infernal Hordes, this new mode becomes unlocked after completing the new questline for the season.</p>



<p>“The Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards,” Blizzard says. “Successfully slay the Hordes and you’ll be able to fight the powerful Fell Council.”</p>



<p>As far as how the mode works, Infernal Hordes sees enemies attack in 90-second waves. After each 90-second wave, you’ll get to decide between three Infernal Offers before the next wave starts. These Infernal Offers will give you options such as increasing the difficulty for more rewards, increasing overall damage, and more. They can also stack as you move through your run.</p>



<p>As you fight, you’ll earn Burning Aether to spend at the end of a run.</p>



<p>“Successfully slay all waves in the Tier you are attempting to advance to the Well of Hatred then battle the Fell Council,” Blizzard continued. “Upon defeating the Fell Council, spend your Burning Aether on Spoils of Hell.”</p>



<p>Spoils of Hell offers four different options after a successful run: Spoils of Equipment, Spoils of Materials, Spoils of Gold, and Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>



<p>In addition to the Infernal Hordes mode, Season 5 will feature new weapons and items, updates to endgame bosses, and more. Currently, Season 5 content is available in the public test realm (PTR) that runs from June 25 – July 2. To join the PTR, you simply have to select the “Public Test Realm” <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#PTR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">option from the dropdown</a> above the play button in Battle.net. </p>

Or if you want to show off, you could find a novel way to play it, just like Twitch streamer Perrikaryal has done by using the power of her mind to make progress.</p><p>Working her way through the Elden Ring DLC--which is quickly earning a reputation for being incredibly challenging--Perrikaryal has already managed to beat several of the early bosses with pure brain power, like those <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-is-just-two-guys-in-a-costume/1100-6524453/">two guys in a Chinese dragon costume</a>.

                <p>Wipeout first launched for PlayStation and DOS in 1995, and it quickly became a cult classic. The series would go on to earn multiple sequels on PlayStation platforms over the next two decades, all of which followed the same futuristic racing blueprint laid out by the original. If you're a dedicated fan of the series, you'll likely be interested in the upcoming <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a></strong>--a hardcover volume that details the game's creation and how the series played a role in shaping the racing genre. The book releases on <strong>November 12</strong>, and preorders are seeing a slight discount ahead of its launch.</p><div title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2470" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$56 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives contains 320 pages filled with commentary, concept art, and additional designs related to Wipeout.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5-1-0-adds-free-legendary-hero-and-more.909771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have released the patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0, which brings a new Legendary Hero, a new game mode to enjoy, and more.</p>
<p>The patch, which is scheduled to arrive tomorrow, introduces the free Legendary Hero Karanak, the Hound of Vengeance. He can stop enemy Lords or Heroes from moving, and he can summon Flesh Hounds to fight alongside him, too.</p>
<p>When enemy units are routing, Karanak gains extra melee attack damage and weapon strength, and he can also reveal hidden units within his radius, so there's no hiding from this tracking hound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=GRQ4eVLw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=jGfQYTl3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0 also brings a new game mode to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Karanak, you can also look forward to a brand new game mode in the form of Conquest, a competitive battle mode that uses the same rules as Land Battle but adds a central capture point to fight over.</p>
<p>To achieve victory in this mode, you'll have to hold that capture point and generate 500 victory tickets. Don't worry, though; this mode won't be replacing Land Battles, as it's primarily designed for multiplayer.</p>
<p>Conquest will utilize 42 "repurposed Land Battle maps" picked by competitive&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>players. Those maps will include Alpine Ridge, Cliff of Beasts, and Mortis Wastes, among others.</p>
<p>Other changes in the patch's rather extensive patch notes include adding an AI option to Domination Mode (as in a CPU player, not generative AI), as well as the addition of Daemons of Chaos to ranked play and much more.</p>

Grab a cup of coffee, though, because it's a pretty long list.</p>
<p>These patch notes arrive just a couple of days after&nbsp;<em>Total War: Rome 2&nbsp;</em>programmer Julian McKinlay released a lengthy statement detailing his experiences at Creative Assembly during the development of that project.</p>
<p>McKinlay says that "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-developers-add-content-aplenty-to-latest-next-dlc-following">recent events</a> involving <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-leadership-apologizes-for-warhammer-3-and-pharaoh-mistakes-promises-action-to">Creative Assembly</a>" prove that his "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it">experiences are still relevant</a> years later".

While it seems like a pretty standard weapon at first glance, it sets itself apart from other axes with its ability to be thrown via a heavy attack. This makes it a killer choice for anyone looking to add a bit of range to their otherwise melee loadout.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196394" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s what you need to know about the Smithscript Axe and where to find it.</p><h2 id="h642"><a id=""></a><strong>Smithscript Axe stats and features</strong></h2><p>The Smithscript Axe has a weight of 5.0 and requires the following stats to wield:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>STR - 13</li><li>DEX - 10</li><li>INT - 11</li><li>FAI - 11</li></ul><p>The weapon comes equipped with Ash of War: Wild Strikes.

There's a training mode, where you can practice your special moves and see things like hit boxes for each character.
