			<p>Today, BioWare released a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> that provides a deep dive into Dragon Age: The Veilguard's accessibility options to make the game as accessible as possible to those who have disabilities and may need extra customization or tweaks to make the game playable for them.&nbsp; The accessibility considerations have been separated into four categories. The accessibility options have been in the design documentation from very early in Dragon Age: The Veilguard's development process, with the options being made with "thoughtful and deliberate implementation of accessibility."</p>
<p>The blog post states that they want to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a fun experience for everyone, regardless of skill or ability. First and foremost, there are multiple combat and difficulty settings. There are classic settings, such as the Storyteller option, which is for those who want to just experience the story without difficulty. Then there are options such as Underdog and Nightmare, which make the combat incredibly challenging and punishing. Additionally, there is an option named Unbound, which allows players to customize all game settings.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Once a player has selected a difficulty, there are more combat options that can be tweaked in the Settings menu, which can help the player make further changes, such as parry timing, aim assist, and aggressiveness of enemies. For those who prefer a cleaner UI and HUD, there are also customizable elements within them, such as elements like Rook's health being completely hidden, as well as the objective tracker or Mini Map.</p>
<p>When it comes to visual accessibility options, players will be able to tweak all of the text size in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. This includes text size in the UI and subtitles, which also have modifiers such as size, opacity, speaker names, and color. There is also the option for audio aids to add to visual-only elements, such as attack indicators. There are also color filters that can improve visibility as well as help those who have color blindness.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there, as there are also the options of Persistent Dot Option and Motion Blur which can be turned off. Camera Shake can be adjusted, with players able to tweak the options from 0-100%. Compared to a lot of games that have been released to a modern audience, BioWare is seemingly going above and beyond to make sure Dragon Age: The Veilguard is accessible and enjoyable for all audiences. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-officially-gold-bioware-confirms/">The title</a> is set to release on 31 October 2024.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265296/new-york-times-nyt-games-zorse-test</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265296/new-york-times-nyt-games-zorse-test<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The New York Times</em> is starting to beta test a new puzzle game called “<em>Zorse</em>,” as <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/08/2024/the-new-york-times-is-testing-a-new-puzzle-called-zorse">reported by <em>Semafor</em></a><em>. </em>The game is a “new phrase guessing game where every puzzle is a mash-up of two phrases,” <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. As <em>Semafor</em> points out, the <em>Zorse</em> name “identifies the offspring of a zebra and another equine,” so it seems like the game will focus on wordplay like that.</p><p>Cohen says <em>Zorse</em> is currently only available in Canada, meaning I can’t play it myself. But my Canada-based colleague Andrew Webster gave it a shot and told me about it; the game sounds a bit like <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> with a puzzle-y twist.</p><p>When you start a <em>Zorse</em> puzzle, you’re given a clue and shown a series of blank tiles that, when revealed, spell out a phrase related to the clue. For today’s puzzle, the letter “H” was filled in for two spots already. From there, you can click on a title and have that letter revealed, and you can do that up to five times. At any point, when you think you know the phrase, you can enter it in.</p><div><figcaption><em>A screenshot of </em>Zorse<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Andrew Webster / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It seems fun to me, but I’m the kind of person who already plays <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Connections</em>, <em>Strands</em>, and the <em>NYT</em> mini crossword every day. Hopefully, <em>Zorse</em> will be available more widely soon so I can try it out.</p><p>It’s not out of the ordinary for the <em>NYT</em> to beta test new games. <em>Strands</em> launched in beta earlier this year before officially becoming a part of the <em>NYT</em> Games app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187656/new-york-times-strands-word-search-games-app">in June</a>. <em>Digits</em>, a math-based puzzle game, wasn’t as lucky, launching in April 2023 in beta before being shut down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23798932/the-new-york-times-digits-math-based-puzzle-game-shut-down">a few months later</a>.</p><p>In other <em>NYT</em> Games news, subscribers can now suffer through old <em>Connections</em> puzzles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24260742/now-you-can-suffer-through-old-connections-puzzles">thanks to a new archive</a>. LinkedIn has some game news as well: it has added a fourth title to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">its lineup</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/linkedin-releases-tango-game-after-launch-of-queens-puzzle-in-may.html">called <em>Tango</em></a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This data reveals, among other things, how Muah users interacted with the chatbots<em>. 404 Media</em>, saw the stolen data and writes that in many cases, users were allegedly trying to create chatbots that could role-play as children.</p><p> “I went to the site to jerk off (to an *adult* scenario, to be clear) and noticed that [Muah.ai] looked like it was put together pretty poorly,” the hacker explained to <em>404 Media</em>. “It’s basically a handful of open-source projects duct-taped together. I started poking around and found some vulnerabilities relatively quickly. At the start, it was mostly just curiosity but I decided to contact [<em>404 Media</em>] once I saw what was in the database.”</p><p>According to <em>404 Media</em>, some of the hacked data contains explicit prompts and messages about sexually abusing toddlers. The outlet reports that it saw one prompt that asked for an orgy with “newborn babies” and “young kids.” <em>404 Media </em>and the hacker couldn’t confirm if Muah.ai actually generated what the users were trying to get, but it’s a dark look at what many people are trying to use controversial AI generation tools to create. </p><p><em>404 Media</em> says that the admin of Muah.ai, who is known as Harvard Han, detected the hack last week. The person running the AI chatbot site also claimed that the hack was “financed” by chatbot competitors in the “uncensored AI industry.” <em>404 Media </em>asked for evidence of this claim and didn’t receive any. The hacker told the outlet they don’t work in the AI industry.</p><p>“We have a team of moderation staff that suspend and delete ALL child-related chatbots on our card gallery, Discord, Reddit, etc,” said Han. The card gallery is the list of community-created AI chatbots available on the site. <br></p><p>As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em>, Muah.ai claims to be an “uncensored” AI chatbot platform, allowing explicit conversations and photos to be created. However, it also claims to ban all underage content according to its website. When two people posted about a reportedly underage AI character on the site’s Discord server, <em>404 Media</em> claims a moderator to the users to not “post that shit” here, but to go “DM each other or something.”</p><p>It’s yet another example of how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atrioc-twitch-deepfake-porn-apology-dmca-ai-takedown-1850229681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atrioc-twitch-deepfake-porn-apology-dmca-ai-takedown-1850229681">AI generation tools </a></span>and chatbots are becoming easier to develop and share online, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laws and regulations around these new pieces of tech are lagging far behind</a></span>.

This is because various foods you make can grant extremely beneficial buffs for a limited time, that will aid you in both PVE and PVP. This is especially as you reach endgame content, where every little boost helps.

One of the most important of these ingredients you’ll need is salt, and it’s not particularly easy to come by if you don’t know how. Let’s fix that.</p><h2 id="h5944"><a id=""></a><strong>How to find salt in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></strong></h2><p>There are three main ways to obtain Salt, and if you intend to level up your cooking skills and be the best chef you can be, I recommend that you make the most of all three sources. Let’s get some sodium in your life.</p><h3 id="h5945"><a id=""></a><strong>1) Via Amitoi Expeditions</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> has collectible pets called Amitoi, and they do more than sit there and look pretty—you can send them off on quests to gather resources. You should always have Amitoi Expeditions going, whether you’re looking for salt or not, but when you <em>are</em> in need you should make sure you’re sending your little friends on expeditions that offer this ingredient.</p><p>One such expedition is Urstella Fields, which can net you up to eight Salt per run. Send your Amitoi on this expedition and check back as soon as possible, so you can keep them out farming for more. Every moment you don’t have an Amitoi Expedition going is a moment you’re not getting Salt, dammit.</p><figure id="" data-id="068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-recommend-id="image://068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-recommend-id="image://068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h5946"><a id=""></a><strong>2) Slaying certain enemies</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Many enemies in the world can drop Salt, but you may be surprised at how rare it can be.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/goat-simulator-remastered-launches-november-7-with-all-dlcs.1004076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/goat-simulator-remastered-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Coffee Stain has revealed that Goat Simulator: Remastered will be released worldwide on November 7. It has been more than a decade since the original game launched, and in little more than a month, it’ll be dropping <strong>again </strong>on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. When Goat Simulator: Remastered was announced, it was confirmed that all previously released DLC would be available with the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-goat-of-games">GOAT of Games</h2>



<p>More than a decade ago, gamers worldwide were left confused by the arrival of Goat Simulator, a game where you played… As a goat. It was a satirical, parody-ridden game that has since spawned two follow-up titles and a couple of spin-offs, and the entire series is not to be taken too seriously.</p>



<p>It was just revealed that Goat Simulator: Remastered will be released on November 7, so it’s not all that long before gamers everywhere can relive experiences they might have had more than ten years ago.</p>



<p>When you secure your copy of Goat Simulator: Remastered, you’ll also be getting a range of expansions:</p>



<ul>
<li>GoatVille</li>



<li>Goat City Bay</li>



<li>Goat MMO</li>



<li>Goat Z</li>



<li>Payday</li>



<li>Waste of Space</li>



<li>Buck to School</li>
</ul>



<p>Coffee Stain said in a recent press release: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve waited 10 years, now we ask that you wait just one more month. Goat Simulator: Remastered is going to knock your socks (hooves?) off, and we promise it’ll probably be worth the wait. We’re so excited to see what our fans think!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Goat Simulator is unbridled entertainment at its finest. While in control of a bizarre-looking goat, you can explore a sandbox environment, wreaking havoc on a local town and everyone who lives there. From licking stuff to using your impressive goat strength to headbutt cars, there’s no end to what you can achieve in Goat Simulator.</p>



<p>Seriously, it’s a hilarious game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">BioWare has detailed the five designed difficulty modes for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and no, they aren't named traditionally as easy, normal, and hard. Additionally, the RPG will offer up an Unbound option that lets players craft their own difficulty setting.</p><p dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accessibility spotlight journal</a> for Dragon Age: The Veilguard explained that players can choose from five curated difficulties during character creation: Storyteller, Keeper, Adventurer, Underdog, and Nightmare. Storyteller lives up to its namesake, as it focuses on seamlessly delivering the game's story rather than challenging combat, while there's no going back from Nightmare unless a new game is started. Keeper is intriguing because it's about "party composition and equipment choices over reaction times." Meanwhile, Adventurer means getting a handle on all three. Last but not least, Underdog seems to equate to a traditional hard mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Unbound is where players can go to tinker with everything to create their personal difficulty mode. However, BioWare recommends one of the five settings above for first-time players in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The developer also notes that there are combat options to tinker with even after choosing difficulty. For example, enemy aggressiveness and aim assist can be altered in the RPG.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="461714819" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

        <p>After servers taken offline "indefinitely".</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Sony has announced it's pulling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet-3">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and all its associated DLC from sale on the PlayStation Store later this month, on 31st October.
</p>
<p>
LittleBigPlanet 3, which was developed by Sumo Digital rather that series originators Media Molecule, released for PS3 and PS4 back in 2014, meaning it celebrates its tenth anniversary this November. Instead of balloons and a nice bit of cake, however, Sony is marking the occasion with a culling, announcing the game's imminent demise in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651">statement shared on X</a>.
</p>
<p>
While LittleBigPlanet 3 and its "entire range" of DLC will be removed from sale on the PlayStation Store on 31st October, Sony notes anyone who currently owns the game - or who purchases its prior to its delisting - will continue to have access following its removal.

<p>
"This is a friendly heads-up that if anyone in the community or any newcomers still wish to own a digital copy of LittleBigPlanet 3 or any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> DLC currently available," it added, "this is your last chance to do so." Back in September, Sony also confirmed LittleBigPlanet 3 would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-playstation-exclusive-leaving-ps-plus-soon">soon be leaving its PS Plus subscription service</a>.
</p><p>
But while it's always disappointing to see another game vanish into the digital ether, it's perhaps not entirely unexpected in LittleBigPlanet 3's case. The series' servers have been repeatedly targeted by nefarious sorts in recent years - with the community having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/without-warning-sony-shuts-down-online-for-older-littlebigplanet-games-to-protect-the-littlebigplanet-community">reported</a> sustained DDOS attacks, offensive error messages, and even exploits enabling malicious users to ban other players - leading Sony to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/without-warning-sony-shuts-down-online-for-older-littlebigplanet-games-to-protect-the-littlebigplanet-community">take all but LittleBigPlanet 3's servers offline</a> in 2021. 
</p>
<p>
However, LittleBigPlanet 3's servers finally suffered the same fate earlier this year, when Sony <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/legal/gameservers/">announced</a> they'd be offline "indefinitely" due to an "ongoing technical issues" - meaning community created content hasn't been accessible since the start of 2024.
</p>
<p>
And with LittleBigPlanet 3 soon set for delisting, it feels like the end of an era for Media Molecule's original platforming series - although protagonist Sackboy lives on, having popped up more recently in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sackboy-a-big-adventure-review">well-received spin-off Sackboy: A Big Adventure</a>. As for Media Molecule - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-layoffs-hit-dreams-developer-media-molecule-report">laid off approximately 20 percent of its staff</a> last year amid "significant strategic changes" - it's currently focused on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dreams-pc-playstation-5-ports-reportedly-canned">unannounced new project</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/jackbox-survey-scramble-release-confirmed-for-24th-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If someone approaching you on the high street with a clipboard in hand sparks nothing but fear, then Jackbox Survey Scramble will be the perfect horror game for a Halloween party when it launches on 24th October.</p>
<p>The game will arrive for all major platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, and will be priced at the rather appealing point of $9.99.</p>


<p>Just ahead of that 24th October release date, PC and Mac owners will be able to get an early look with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/">a Jackbox Survey Scramble demo</a> available during the Steam Next Fest from 14th to 21st October. That will give you access to two of the game’s four modes – Hilo and Squares.</p>
<p>This is Guesspionage souped up into a full standalone product. Hilo is a game where you guess the most and least popular answers, while Squares has you organise choices in popularity order. The other two games are Speed mode, where you’re guessing against the clock, and a mode where you can intercept your opponents answers in Bounce.</p>
<p>In each case, the survey data that the game is drawing from is dynamically shifting based on the answers that you and all of the game’s players are feeding into it. Come back to the game a week, a month, a year later and the same prompts will potentially give rather different answers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Off the back of the recently released Jackbox Naughty Pack, Jackbox is making this a game with broader settings. One of the question examples is “what’s the cutest word for a butt?” but that won’t be in there if you apply content filters for a lower age range. There’s also streamer settings and accessibility options aplenty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking Naughty Pack, this is the first year in a decade without a 5-game Party Pack release, and Naughty Pack didn’t manage to fill that void for us in anywhere near the same way. An experimental fumble in the dark which sought to put more adult-rated prompts and games together, it did not land. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Naughty Pack review</a>, Jason said, “Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, […] Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s hoping that Survey Scramble can right the good ship Jackbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/roblox-accused-of-lying-to-investors-about-user-numbers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In new accusations from the investment firm<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Hindenburg Research</a>, Roblox has landed themselves in hot water, as they are accused of lying to investors about their user numbers. Hindenburg Research has claimed that it is "consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more." This isn't the first time Roblox had some trouble, as Roblox has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/">banned from Turkiye</a> for possible child exploitation. While they are said to be working with the government to try and fix this issue, it seems that Roblox is still blocked. Roblox went public in 2021 and reported that they had 79.5 million daily players. However, Hindenburg claims that this number is statistically incorrect.</p>
<p>Hindenburg is claiming that Roblox "intentionally conflates" actual people with daily users, where that number has the potential to include alt accounts and bots, which is a huge problem on the platform. The research released by Hindenburg alleges that Roblox is capable of separating alt accounts from single users, although Roblox has disclosed that daily active users "are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox." In their report, they also say that their research indicates that "engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%."</p>
<p>The report also mentions that before Roblox went public, it would report the number of "people" on its platform, saying "there are over 54.1 million people coming to Roblox every day" in a 2022 report. However, Hindenburg says that the number of 'people' matches Roblox's reported Daily Active Users. As stated above, they disclose that their DAU is not a measure of unique individuals. As a result, Hindenburg believes that they are intentionally conflating "people" with DAUs.</p>
<p>In 2023, Roblox told the SEC that it is "unable to identify if a user has multiple accounts," a response that Hindenburg believes is a lie. This is after multiple former employees spoke to Hindenburg Research, saying that "Roblox does internally track single users with multiple accounts, referring to the process as de-alting."</p>
<p>The report made by Hindenburg is incredibly lengthy and says that in interviews, "Roblox effectively has two sets of books for counting users: one for internal business decisions, in which multiple accounts are de'alted', and one used by the finance team that reports higher metrics to investors."</p>
<p>Roblox as a platform continues to grow, and whether this highly detailed report will have any effect on the company or whether they will now have to answer to these allegations remains to be seen, but it's possible that the investors will not be happy if Roblox has been making out that they are more successful than they actually are.</p>

Your favorite chaotic sandbox is back and more beautiful than ever, with updated graphics, every downloadable content, and more bugs that you can shake a goat at. WASD to rewrite history.</p><p>Your goal? Chaos! Your muse? Pilgor the goat! If you’ve had your horns in the sand for the last 10 years, Goat Simulator is a game about causing as much destruction as you possibly can, as a goat. Headbutt, backflip and ragdoll your way around each level to earn points, and come up with creative ways to ruin an NPC’s day.</p><p><em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> is the remaster no one asked for. It comes with everything you loved about the original game and more, with new and improved visuals, updated textures, shiny new lighting, and some brand-new foliage showing off the finest in advanced goat simulation technology. We’ve also completely reworked Mutators, allowing you to pick and choose whichever “goat” you desire from a handy in-game menu. You just have to catch them all first!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The remaster also includes every downloadable content from the PC version, and one of our favorites from the mobile version, including:</p><ul><li>“GoatVille” – The Big Apple of Goat Simulator, as some would say…</li><li>“Goat City Bay” – The coastal jewel of northern GoatAsia.</li><li>“Goat MMO” – A fantasy <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,802 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> across lands unknown.</li><li>“Goat Z” – Can you survive the apocalypse?</li><li>“PAYDAY” – Gather your crew and prepare for a heist!</li><li>“Waste Of Space” – Explore the outer reaches of space and see what popular sci-fi references lie within…</li><li>“Buck to School” – From <em>Goat Simulator Mobile</em>, GoatVille high has a new jock in town.</li></ul><p>There are also less exciting new things, like general optimization and bug fixing—but we promise we mainly fixed the boring ones.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>You can be a goat… again.</li><li>No really, that’s still the main selling point.</li><li>A brand spanking new mutator menu that lets you mix and match goats to your heart’s content—if your contentment means abominations.</li><li>As buggy as you remember—just because it’s a remaster doesn’t mean we haven’t left in an unhealthy dose of physics-based bugs because why not?</li><li>All downloadable content included—we could have sold them separately to you again, but if we’re honest this is already a cash-grab.</li><li>New and improved graphics, lighting, VFX and animations – as well as revamped foliage for the prettiest leaves you’ll see in a <em>Goat Simulator</em> game excluding <em><a title="Games > Goat Simulator 3 [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a></em>.</li></ul><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em> is a completely stupid game and has been a completely stupid game since we first invented goat simulation over 10 years ago.

                <p>Media Molecule has announced that LittleBigPlanet 3 will be delisted from the PlayStation Network Store on October 31, along with seemingly every single piece of DLC in the series.</p><p>"After 10 years of playing, creating, and sharing content in LittleBigPlanet 3, the game and our entire range of LittleBigPlanet DLC will be removed from the PlayStation Store on October 31, 2024," Media Molecule said in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> on Twitter.</p><p>The studio also said that anyone who purchases the game or any LittleBigPlanet DLC will still be able to access it even after the content is removed from sale.

            <p>Ah, this makes for sore reading. Spanish developers Tequila Works have cancelled a game and made a "small" number of layoffs in the face of financial difficulties.</p>
<p>“With deep regret, we must inform of the decision to cancel an unannounced game,” reads a post from Tequila on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/">LinkedIn</a>. “This tough decision means we will be restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game. These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected," it goes on.</p>
<p>Tequila remain best known for Rime, a first-class graduate of the Ico-meets-Zelda school of small children exploring emotive fantasy worlds that are probably metaphors for something, but they’re also co-developers and publishers of The Sexy Brutale, one of my personal favourite time-rewindy puzzlers. Their last game was a League Of Legends spin-off, Song Of Nunu. Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/song-of-nunu-a-league-of-legends-story-review-simple-3d-platforming-with-lots-of-heart%E2%80%9D">called it</a> “a heartfelt, winsome platformer that doesn't require any knowledge of League Of Legends to enjoy”. Before that they made Gylt, which Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gylt-is-an-alan-wake-for-kids-adventure-that-trains-you-in-the-ways-of-survival-horror%E2%80%9D">was charmed by</a>, calling it Alan Wake for kids and a nice intro to the nuances of commercial game design at large. Here’s a longer chunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want your child to learn that you can move or climb yellow things in games, that enemies often have glowing vulnerable spots, that you can go back to previously locked off areas to find things, that you should grid search games to find the three MacGuffins you need, that it's often economical to run past enemies to get to the next area, and that being a bystander to bullying if you're not participating yourself is still really bad, then gosh, Gylt will do all of that in one.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say that Tequila Works are good folk with many strings to their bow. I hope things pick up from here. Best of luck to the people who’ve lost their jobs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sadly, huge amounts of the game’s dialogue aren’t read aloud by its stellar voice cast. That’s in stark contrast to <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, which included voice acting for every chapter of its relationship-building social links.</p><p>Part of this is likely because production on <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>began long before <em>Reload</em>, which went into development in 2019. <em>Reload</em> is a remake of an existing 2006 RPG, though, so it’s not surprising that the team managed to get it out the door more quickly than <em>Metaphor</em>, a brand-new game and franchise for the studio. <em>Metaphor</em>, meanwhile, was first announced way back in 2016, shortly after <em>Persona 5 </em>was released in Japan, so it’s not surprising that it follows the format of previous Atlus games where voice acting is concerned. <em>Metaphor</em>, like <em>Persona 5</em>, only voices the first and last of its social link-style follower stories, so all the build-up is only portrayed through text and pantomiming.</p><p>With games like <em>Metaphor</em> that have dialogue presented visual novel-style with text boxes and voice acting, I tend to switch on the setting to have lines auto-progress and watch them like an anime. With a voice cast as strong as <em>Metaphor</em>’s, it’s always a treat to get to a fully voice-acted scene and hear the crew work their magic. Those were plentiful in the main story, but when you spend hours getting to know characters and the world in these side relationships, it’s a bummer that they don’t get to give voice to some pretty meaningful moments in between the intro and conclusion.</p><p>My hope is that this is just a matter of <em>Metaphor</em> being in development for so long, and that <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>is a more accurate declaration of what Atlus plans to do on this front in the future. With any luck, sometime down the line <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> may get a <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>-style re-release and Atlus might fully voice these scenes in a few years. Until then, I’ll enjoy the times the voice cast does get to pop off, though they’re fewer and farther between than I would like. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new report has alleged that Roblox misleads investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">report</a>, published by short-selling firm Hindenberg Research (via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=NV9qAB">Wall St Journal</a>), claims that daily player counts and engagement statistics have been inflated by Roblox since 2021, based on interviews with multiple former employees at the company.
</p>
<p>
A Roblox spokesperson has responded to the report to say it was "simply misleading".
</p>
<p>
More damning still are a fresh set of examples that appear to show Roblox's content moderation system failing to keep children safe - and to stop adult content circulating.
</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that Roblox is a safe and secure platform," a Roblox spokesperson said in response.</p>
<p>
The report includes examples seen by Hindenberg Research of Roblox experiences named after sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker P Diddy, as well as chatrooms where Hindenberg staff say they witnessed child sexual abuse images being openly traded.
</p>
<p>
Roblox's share price tumbled 4.6 percent in the wake of Hindenberg Research's report being published - and it's worth acknowledging that the business model of short-selling firms such as this is to benefit as a result. Still, this on its own does not bring any of its research into doubt, and any share price recovery from the report being proven incorrect would expose it to a huge amount of risk.
</p><p>
In its report, Hindenberg Research claims Roblox insiders have cashed out $1.7bn in stock while reporting losses each quarter. Publicly, Roblox boasts off of huge engagement statistics, but the report says user numbers have been inflated by "25 to 42 percent", while user engagement hours have been "inflated by an estimated 100+ percent". 
</p>
<p>
The report claims that Roblox user numbers are being artificially inflated by multiple accounts owned by the same user, as well as large numbers of bot accounts used to farm in-game items or artificially boost player follower accounts. It's these secondary accounts which former employees say the company detects but does not flag publicly.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Roblox is claimed to have an actual player count it uses for internal business decisions, with "alt" and bot accounts removed (a correction process it refers to as its numbers being "de-alted"), as well as the publicly-communicated player number it reports to investors. 
</p>
<p>
"If that number [Daily Active Users] is not 'de-alted', I think the actual one would be like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower," a former data scientist at the company told Hindenberg Research. 
</p>
<p>
The report details how it has determined that large numbers of bot accounts are active on the platform, and highlights the existence of widely-available tools for users to run more than 20 Roblox bot accounts at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
On the issue of child safety, the report dubs Roblox an "X-rated paedophile hellscape" that exposes children to "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech". 
</p>
<p>
A former senior product designer told Hindenberg Research that compromises to protect child accounts meant "limiting users' engagement" which meant "hurting your metrics... in a lot of cases, the leadership doesn't want that".
</p>
<p>
The report's authors say they, using an account set with an age "under 13", personally witnessed child sex abuse images being openly traded within user groups, and members "soliciting sexual acts from minors". 
</p>
<p>
The report details numerous Roblox games titled "Escape to Epstein Island" and "Run From Diddy Simulator" and variations thereof, images of male genitalia being shared in a "school simulator" game with no age restrictions, and other games designed around killing pregnant women, going on a shooting spree in a hospital, or simulating sex acts in public toilets.
</p><p>
Finally, returning to player numbers, the report claims Roblox is now reaching a saturation point in the US and Europe, with profitability per user falling as it seeks to continue growing its audience numbers, as it adds "loss-generating users in markets like Asia, per a former employee". 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, a game played by millions of young people, has continually been criticised for its child safety breaches. This summer, a Bloomberg report revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors, following contact in-game.

            <p>Swedish video game publishers Thunderful are selling some steam, which is terrific news for those of us who don't live near saunas and are thus cruelly deprived of their widely-accepted health and wellness benefits, which date all the way back to the ancient Mayans. Oh wait, I read the press release wrong. Thunderful are actually having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/ThunderfulSale2024">a Steam <em>sale</em></a>, with up to 90% off such well-regarded games as Laika: Aged Through Blood, Swordship, Viewfinder and, just to confuse me further, several SteamWorld games.</p>
<p>Of the games on discount, I would focus on Viewfinder, now 45% off, in which you get a camera that can turn photographs into bits of walkable terrain. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">Bestest Best review</a>, Rachel (RPS in peace) enthused that "its reality-shifting, mind-bending hook is constantly fascinating, and the directions it takes will leave your head spinning in the best way possible". To that, I'm going to add Swordship - 70% off - which Matt Cox (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/swordships-11-update-is-a-great-excuse-to-get-this-snazzy-dodge-em-up-on-your-radar">hailed</a> for its "purity of purpose".</p>
<p>There's also The Gunk, which Katharine (RPS in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gunk-review">called</a> "a safe but stunning adventure from the SteamWorld devs" - it's 75% off.  Kaan Serin (RPS in Gamesradar, at the minute) was similarly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pull-off-sick-motorcycle-backflips-to-reload-in-this-gorgeous-motorvania">keen</a> on the demo for Laika: Aged Through Blood, though we never commissioned him to review it: he remarked that it "seems to be mashing My Friend Pedro's bullet violence and Trials' motorcycle-spinning physics into a Metroidvania formula". The Steam user consensus is that it sticks the landing. </p>
<p>Kaan did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/white-shadows-review-a-twisted-musical-joyride-that-loses-a-little-steam">review</a> White Shadows, currently 85% off, summarising it as "two hours of creative, chilling designs, joyous musical set pieces and enough screen-shottable sights to fill your hard drive". You can get that one for about the price of a family-sized bag of chips. Alternatively, reserve your pennies for Somerville, now 65% off, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">summarised as follows</a>: "Mechanically simple but visually engrossing, Somerville offers an interesting, if not particularly deep, sci-fi adventure." </p><p>Thunderful have published some good stuff, though they are also one of those publishers who wildly over-invested during the pandemic lockdown years. In January this year, they announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">they would lay off around 20 per cent of their staff</a> in order "to reduce costs and focus the business on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Or, as it’s often summed up, if a gun shows up at some point in your story, by the end, it had better go off. So, when a gun shows up early in my playthrough of narrative game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story"><em>Apartment Story</em></a></span><em>,</em> you can imagine where my mind immediately went.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="194012,193534,194617" data-current="194012"><div><p>April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The game, from developer Blue Rider Interactive, is clearly working within that basic narrative concept but its connections to theater and the medium’s style of storytelling go even deeper. What that results in is a brisk esoteric narrative blending Chekhov with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683"><em>The Sims</em></a></span> in fascinating ways that don’t always work, but are utterly unique in execution.</p><p>Before the gun shows up in <em>Apartment Story</em>, you might find the gameplay loop pretty mundane, even boring. It’s a life simulator in which you control Arthur, an out-of-a-job writer cooped up in his apartment doing nothing of importance. You’ll take a shower, eat some food, have a cigarette, type away at your computer, jerk off, drink beer, watch a movie, or any number of basic things. What makes these activities all the more interesting, however, is how much effort each of them take. </p><figure id="" data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want to make a basic meal you need to manually open the fridge, individually pick up each ingredient and drop it on a cooking board, activate the stovetop to actually cook, wait 15 in-game minutes, grab a plate to serve the food on, then sit down at a table to eat. It’s a lengthy process and on paper it’s pretty uninteresting, but the mundane loop still manages to scratch that itch in your brain that makes you want to do it again and again. To encourage you to actually engage with the loop, Arthur has a list of needs that must be managed, like hunger. If any of these stats gets too low you’ll start moving slower.<br></p><p>Arthur’s normal life begins to get strange when his old roommate Dianne shows up asking to grab something from one of his rooms. That mysterious thing is, shocker, the gun. It’s been hidden in the bedroom of your absent current roommate Godot (more theater references for you). Dianne tells you a story about how she is running from her abusive lover and is ready to protect herself in any way. Over the next couple of in-game days, during which you still have to manage all your stats, Dianne’s entrance back into your life turns it into a thriller in which your safety is not guaranteed. That is first illustrated when you awake one morning to discover everything in your apartment has been thrown across the floor and a man named Blondie—who identifies himself as Dianne’s lover—is sitting at your dining table. He tells you to stay away from Dianne and then beats the shit out of you. </p><p>While Blondie’s appearance should have made me worry for Dianne and Arthur’s lives, the first thing I felt was rage at the state of the apartment. This asshole threw all of my shit across the apartment and now I have to clean it. I had to pick up each book, DVD, plant, and fork one-by-one and organize them in some way that made the apartment feel clean again. It’s an excellent way to make me more invested in the outcome of the story, because after that, I kind of wanted to kill that guy too!</p><figure id="" data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The use of Chekhov’s gun in <em>Apartment Story</em> keeps you on your toes, which is what the device has always been intended to accomplish. Once the gun is in the picture you’re more on edge, more attentive to everything Arthur, Dianne, and Blondie do and say. But what’s even more interesting is how <em>Apartment Story</em> adds a twist to the narrative device that only games can—while tradition says that the gun must go off, <em>Apartment Story</em> leaves that decision up to you. No gun actually has to be fired, though there will be consequences to pulling the trigger or not. There is also plenty of narrative downtime, during which you’ll have to occupy several in-game hours of Arthur’s life with mundane tasks while you wait for something to happen, which breaks up the dramatic highs in an absurdly hilarious way thanks to the ridiculous life-sim elements.<br></p><p>From start to finish, <em>Apartment Story</em> will take you about two hours to complete. The writing is strongest in the early sections of the game, as it feels more grounded in the mundanity of Arthur’s depressing life. As the game goes on, and the stakes get higher, the story devolves into melodrama with some predictable beats. But the blending of life sim elements with a high stakes narrative that takes place in a relatively short period of time—both in-game and in reality—makes for a compelling game that has you steadily more invested as it goes on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Iron Gate has unveiled what’s next for Valheim, uncovering the Bog Witch update, which is preparing to enter public testing. Valheim, which entered early access in 2021, has proven to be a hit with gamers worldwide, offering a tougher-than-average title with base-building, combat, and RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>In the game’s next major update, Iron Gate is adding a mysterious denizen, new multiplayer mechanics, farming, and a range of fresh decorations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-down-to-the-bog">Go Down to the Bog</h2>



<p>The swamps of Valheim aren’t to be trifled with, but per the latest update that Iron Gate is working on, you’ll soon have a new reason to venture down to the bog. In this upcoming patch, players will be able to find The Bog Witch, a mysterious vendor selling all manner of potions, materials, and crafting recipes.</p>



<p>If you’re an adept chef, you’ll be able to utilise new features added in this update to prepare monumental feasts for your friends, thanks to the ingredients and recipes you get from The Bog Witch. To stay on theme, Iron Gate is adding a string of recipes themed on the swamps, such as the Swamp Dweller’s Delight.</p>



<p>In addition, players will be able to grind new and updated skills: Cooking and Farming. If you want, you can equip a scythe to make it easier to harvest your crops – that’s new in this update as well. If that wasn’t enough, Iron Gate is introducing new kitchen stations, a line of decorations, and some mysterious cooking ingredients, keeping everything aligned.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when The Bog Witch update will arrive, but keep your eyes peeled – it won’t be long.</p>



<p>Do you enjoy playing Valheim? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Lavapotion has revealed the first major DLC for its turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest. The Vanir DLC update will add a new player faction, units, biome, and more to Songs of Conquest this winter.</p>



<p>According to Lavapotion, the Vanir faction is inspired by Scandinavian and Viking folklore.</p>



<p>“In the world of Aerbor, the Vanir are direct descendants of indebted Baryans and Arleon settlers who have become a raiding nation scouring the Bleak East region for riches,” the studio said. “However, the Bleak East is a hostile place, and the Vanir were forced to embrace the temperamental creatures of the land known as Vildra, allowing them to change into fearsome beasts full of rage and power.”</p>



<h2 id="h-songs-of-conquest-vanir-dlc-details">Songs Of Conquest Vanir DLC Details</h2>



<p>With the addition of the new faction comes new unites for players. There are eight new units in total to build your armies with as Vanir.  Those units are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Huskarl </strong>– a sturdy warrior equipped with a spear and shield that can transform into a Korphan</li>



<li><strong>Berserker </strong>– a juggernaut full of rage that can change into a mighty bear to challenge any who seek to hurt their brethren</li>



<li><strong>Chieftain </strong>– a commander of the Vanir force that can grow to enormous proportions and become the gigantic and mighty Jormr</li>



<li><strong>Swine </strong>– embodying the mythological beast eaten by gods each night only to be resurrected the next day</li>



<li><strong>Troll</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lyke</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bacahorse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nornor</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Also coming with the DLC are nine new Wielder hero units, five new Conquest maps, and even two new Challenge maps. The maps are built to offer players a challenge while learning the new faction and terrain.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-change-in-plans">A Change In Plans</h2>



<p>The announcement of the Vanir DLC is a change from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/songs-of-conquest-sells-500000-copies-announces-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced roadmap</a>. Vanir was originally scheduled for the spring 2025, but plans changed after feedback from players.</p>



<p>“While our original plan was to release a large expansion next year that would feature two new factions and a sweeping new campaign, we chose to listen to our players and change our plans to release more content sooner, starting with the release of the Vanir DLC this winter,” Lavapotion founder and CEO Magnus Alm said.  </p>



<p>By changing the focus of development, the Rise Eternal campaign has been pushed back from the fall 2024 release.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Songs of Conquest Vanir DLC launches this winter. An exact release date as well as price will be available at a later date. The game is available on Steam, but is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to mobile</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
