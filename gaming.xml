            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-epic-games-store-leak-ff9-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A huge Epic Games Store leak has resulted in several major projects being leaked, and though many of them are hidden behind codenames, enterprising onlookers are already doing the work to uncover the games' identities.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra user MondoMega</a>, this leak occurred thanks to the launch of <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>-esque website EpicDB (which is currently down at time of writing). Searching a publisher's page on EpicDB uncovers tons of projects that were seemingly not intended for public eyes.</p>
<p>The good folks over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">compiled a list</a> of those projects, with major publishers like Square Enix, Sega, Rockstar, and Sony being included in the leak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-ix-remake-leak-epic-games-store.jpg?itok=akpaiCA7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-ix-remake-leak-epic-games-store.jpg?itok=MXqnh5Kw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, this leak has some good things in store for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the games have fairly unhelpful codenames, although there are exceptions. Saber Interactive, for instance, has a project listed that's simply named&nbsp;<em>Turok</em>, which is, incredibly enough, likely a new&nbsp;<em>Turok&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>On THQ Nordic's page, a project titled&nbsp;<em>Remnant 3&nbsp;</em>can be seen, and it's not hard to guess what that might be. Others, meanwhile, are much more obscure; what, for instance, are Sega's&nbsp;<em>Porridge</em>,&nbsp;<em>Croquembouche</em>, and&nbsp;<em>CurlyWurly</em>, other than great names?</p>
<p>Some projects, despite being codenamed, are fairly easy to decipher given the additional information that was available on EpicDB.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Momo</em>, for instance, is almost certainly the long-rumored&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX&nbsp;</em>remake, given that it apparently offers the "Tetra Master Starter Pack" and "Thief's Knives" as pre-order DLC bonuses.</p>
<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-requirements-demo">know is currently in the works at Square Enix</a>, is also apparently on the cards for Epic, as examining the data for the codenamed entry&nbsp;<em>Skobeloff&nbsp;</em>seemingly leads to&nbsp;<em>FFXVI&nbsp;</em>being named.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-epic-games-store-leak.jpg?itok=XPAhJstQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-epic-games-store-leak.jpg?itok=-eJLRwJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s PC version is also seemingly included in this Epic Games Store leak.</figcaption></figure><p>Other projects include a potential PC release for&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, as well as Epic listings for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the existence of these games in Epic's database doesn't necessarily mean their release is imminent, or even that they're still active projects.</p>
<p>Publishers might create database entries for games like these for a lot of reasons, and many of the entries in the leak, including the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IX&nbsp;</em>remake, haven't been updated in several months or even years.</p>
<p>As an example, there's an entry for a game codenamed&nbsp;<em>Testament</em>, which users are suggesting could be Sony's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. That game was never released on Epic Games Store, and while a launch on the store isn't impossible, it might just be an aborted database entry that was never needed in the end.</p>
<p>While the entries in the database might be contested, the leak itself isn't; this is all internal data from Epic's database, so these projects certainly exist in Epic's backend.</p>
<p>However, Epic has subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-epic-leak-hints-at-unannounced-games-coming-to-epic-games-store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> confirming that database tools can't crawl for unannounced titles anymore, so a leak like this isn't likely to happen again. Still, the data gleaned from the leak isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Phantom Blade Zero Preview - A Blast of Fast-Paced Action]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/phantom-blade-zero-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-preview-a-blast-of-fast-paced-action.899022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/phantom-blade-zero-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> first appeared last year during PlayStation's State of Play with a super flashy trailer. That continued again this year, with another trailer to end the Summer Game Fest stream. After playing some of the game myself, the trailers were accurate.</p>
<p>When I first saw <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, I thought that it was another soulslike. This is something that the developer told me they've heard a lot of, and I imagine a large part of that has to do with the dark fantasy artstyle.</p>
<p>However, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> is an action game more in the vein of the <em>Devil May Cry</em> series than anything else.</p>

<p>You have your standard light attack, heavy attack, dodge, block, and parry. One thing the developers mentioned is that they made blocking easy, just hold down a button, to make the game have a lower barrier to entry. That doesn't mean you can just block your way to victory, however.</p>
<p>Dodging and attacking use stamina, but you can keep your combo going if you switch to your second set of weapons mid-combo. That will refresh the stamina meter, letting you continue to wail on your opponent.</p>
<p>I was equipped with a sword and another seat of weapons in two short swords/daggers. I also had access to a bow and two special abilities, one of which was a cannon I could charge up to three levels and devastate enemies.</p>
<p>Having played about 20 minutes or so of the game, i was just starting to get into a flow with the combat before my time was up. It is quick, twitchy, and greatly rewards those with good reflexes.</p>
<p>Parrying at the right moment will let you hit enemies with a pretty good attack, but they also have some attacks that are not blockable or parryable, so you'll need to dodge them. Those flash with the now industry standard red, while moves you can parry flash blue.</p>
<p>I should note that the general attacks were not something I could parry. Parrying was set up for specific attacks, otherwise you have to dodge out of the way or block your enemy's attacks.</p>

<p>The enemy design was fairly basic, but I imagine that's just due to showing off the game for the first time to folks. I did fight the one boss featured in the second trailer they put out, and he was a bit tougher.</p>
<p>He had a large flail-like weapon that he would flash out an attack with every so often, which would break up his pattern some. Learning the little ticks and tells of what he was going to do was satisfying, and it just made me want to keep going.</p>
<h2>Phantom Blade Zero Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>All I can say is that this felt like a fairly polished action game that will satisfy everyone that likes fast-paced gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is we all have to wait a while, as we won't see <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> for at least a couple of more years. The fact that it already feels this great from a core mechanic view is really encouraging, however.</p>
<p>Let's all hope for some more insane trailers over the next couple of years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176795/nintendo-switch-twitter-x-integration-ends<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="17gSVc">It seems as though Nintendo, like everyone else, is finally fed up with toxicity, engagement farming, NSFW replies, and the utter randomness of the For You feed. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">latest Nintendo Switch firmware update</a> has removed all integration with X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk’s social network.</p>
<p id="Gs0a6D"><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057/~/discontinuation-of-x-%28formerly-twitter%29-integration-and-social-media">As of June 10</a>, you can no longer post screenshots to X from your Switch or link your X and Nintendo Accounts. Nintendo also removed the ability send friend requests to friends and followers on all social media platforms. Just to prove it’s nothing personal against Elon, Nintendo hinted that image-sharing via Facebook may be removed “at a later date,” too.</p>
<p id="h9j5GP">If you want to share images from your Switch’s photo album on X, you now have to transfer them to another device first — either via USB connection to a PC, or wirelessly (using Nintendo’s quite clever QR code system) to a smart device.</p>
<p id="ZVQDxI">Nintendo is actually the last platform holder to turn its back on X integration; Microsoft and Sony disabled the feature on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23692583/microsoft-twitter-api-elon-musk-pricing-xbox">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23949334/playstation-twitter-x-ps4-ps5-ps-app">PlayStation</a> consoles last year. It’s likely that the console-makers have left X due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price">exorbitant API fees</a> imposed by Musk, which can result in companies paying over $40,000 per month for little-used features.</p>
<p id="5jyhX7">At time of writing, Nintendo had yet to post links to its Bluesky and Mastodon accounts on its profile page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Zvp228">When the first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24105856/it-looks-like-star-wars-is-finally-getting-its-watchmen-in-the-acolyte">trailer for Lucasfilm’s latest Star Wars series</a>, <em>The Acolyte</em>, dropped back in March, the group email for my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24145239/best-star-wars-board-games-ttrpg-rebellion-unlimited-shatterpoint-edge-of-empire">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire</a> role-playing game immediately blew up. The tongue-in-cheek question on our minds was whether someone at Lucasfilm had been secretly monitoring our latest story arc: Our game is set during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">Old Republic era</a> and <em>The Acolyte</em> is a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">High Republic-era story</a>, but otherwise, everything we knew about the new series seemed entirely compatible with the original story our game master had whipped up, about a Jedi kidnapping dozens of Force-sensitive children for training, and quietly advising the local Commerce Guild outpost on ways to violently suppress the local uprising that resulted.</p>
<p id="GGdMpW">From what we knew about <em>The Acolyte</em> back then, it just seemed like a funny coincidence that the show’s teaser and the arc we were about to conclude were so in sync. We assumed once the series aired and its storyline was clearer, it’d be a lot more obvious that the Jedi were meant to be the heroes in <em>The Acolyte</em>, and any seeming morally gray areas would be cleared up.</p>
<p id="Ezem6U">But episode 3 of <em>The Acolyte </em>doesn’t make anything clearer. If anything, it muddies the already pretty murky waters around the ways the Jedi acquire kids for training, and how they treat those kids once they have them. The episode deliberately obfuscates a lot of important detail about what happened on the planet Brendok, clearly with some form of reveal to come, possibly even exonerating the Jedi from, for instance, murdering everyone in Mae and Osha’s witch coven. But what it does show us about Jedi recruitment tactics sure doesn’t paint them in a positive light.</p>

<p id="630qgl">Consider the events of this episode in the most generous light possible, from the presumed Jedi perspective. At this point in the Star Wars timeline, they’re a significant power in the galaxy, essentially space cops out to protect the Republic, prevent the balance of the Force from shifting toward darkness, and prevent war from spreading across the galaxy. They find a forbidden cult creating and training children, all while lying to the authorities and claiming they aren’t doing any of that.</p>
<p id="LtUF67">Galactic law might allow the Jedi to carve a path through these criminal sect members and take the children into custody, but instead, they simply note that they’d like to know whether Mae and Osha are fit for Jedi training and interested in joining up. Osha is, so they invite her to join them. Mae then goes ham, somehow kills everyone else present by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23940294">setting a stone mountain on fire</a>, then dies in the aftermath. Fortunately, the noble Jedi are there to give the poor surviving orphan girl a home.</p>
<p id="QHuT0J">A strong pro-Jedi viewer stance — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSOBeD1GC_Y&amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim">looking at the situation from a certain point of view, as it were</a> — makes that read at least possible, if not entirely plausible. But the same story looks radically different from the victims’ perspective, which seems to be what the episode is taking as text. It’s entirely unclear why this Force-using coven was banned and ordered not to train children. There’s never any sense that they’re doing any harm. Their coven seems like a warm, supportive place to grow up. Their only questionable act is impressing their values and training on Osha, who’s dubious about whether this is the future she wants. But the fact that their induction ritual clearly requires her consent — and the fact that they’ve obviously educated her about the Jedi in a neutral enough way that she was allowed to decide for herself that they’re heroes — are both votes in their favor.</p>

<p id="isMqHz">And then these outsiders come along and stalk the children without notifying their mother or other guardians. They confront the coven in the middle of a sacred ritual. They force the children to take a Jedi suitability test without allowing their mother to be present, or telling her anything about what’s involved. (And at least half of it appears to be a medical test for midi-chlorian levels, administered without warning or consent.) After the test, they invite a minor child to join their sect, again without conferring with her mother. Whatever happens next isn’t necessarily their fault, but it unquestionably happens because they invade a seemingly peaceful, obscure separatist group and try to talk one of their children into permanently abandoning her family and coming away with them to a distant planet, where they plan to inculcate her with their own values, including a belief that emotional connections of any kind are inherently bad and forbidden.</p>
<p id="yUDG4Z">None of this is a good look for the Jedi. The whole sequence, with its deliberate omissions and obfuscations, feeds directly into the questions fans have had about Jedi recruitment since the prequel movies started showing us more about the induction process. The baseline Jedi rules are remarkably similar to <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/cult4.htm">real-world cult tactics</a>: Trainees are separated from their families and taught to disavow any personal connections, they’re forced to accept their teachers’ proscriptive ascetic values, and it’s made clear that any deviation or pushback against them is cause for expulsion from their replacement family. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics"><em>Phantom Menace</em></a>-era Jedi also refuse trainees as “too old” starting at least at age 9, which reads as a feeling that inductees should be young enough to be malleable, without any pesky emotional attachments or opinions of their own.</p>
<p id="FMr5xp">Add all that to the Jedi tendency toward doctrinaire thinking and arrogance, and you have a recipe for the entirely plausible situation we were navigating in my Edge of the Empire game, where a single Jedi decided it was so important that Force-sensitive younglings receive “proper” training that she engineered false-flag medical programs in order to get her hands on local children, test them, and then take them from their parents by force. Given some of the arrogance we’ve already seen from Jedi in the Star Wars movie and TV canon, an overreaching Jedi driven by self-righteousness seemed like an entirely plausible villain. Which is why, when that first <em>Acolyte</em> trailer dropped, my gaming group started trading internet memes that tapped into the same uncomfortable response to Jedi behavior around children and indoctrination.  </p>

<p id="Fm2t8B">We’ve already seen quite a bit of the same arrogance in <em>The Acolyte</em>, particularly in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">Vernestra Rwoh</a> heavily implying that Osha needed to be rounded up quickly and sentenced quickly for Indara’s murder, as a show of Jedi strength — even if there was no evidence that Osha was guilty. Even if no one bothered with the barest baseline of investigation — for instance, checking the flight logs on the ship she was working on, to see whether she plausibly could have been in a different part of the galaxy an unknown number of parsecs away in order to kill Indara. That same arrogance leads the Jedi to drop a supposedly superpowered, Jedi-killing Force user on a droid-operated prison ship, with no guards or oversight.</p>
<p id="ESgoG6">And it leads Indara and her team to handle the Brendok operation in either the clumsiest, most intrusive way possible, or the most purposefully disruptive. Episode 3<strong> </strong>deliberately hides information from the audience to make it unclear which is true — but there’s still no way to read these events so the Jedi are diplomatic, tactful, or blameless when things go wrong.</p>
<p id="lKRvBc">The upside of all of this, at least for Star Wars fans, is that Jedi can be terrific antagonists for a Star Wars RPG without any need for GMs to twist the canon, or for players to embrace the dark side of the Force. Arrogant agents of a Galactic organization that outlaws any organizations that disagree with its dogma, then punishes them for their beliefs by taking their children away for re-education, are already neatly set up to be villains. </p>
<p id="QT4ian">All the grotesque questions <em>The Phantom Menace </em>raised come up again in the light of <em>The Acolyte</em>’s story. Why, after a Jedi lured Anakin Skywalker away from his planet and his enslaved mother, was the Jedi Council so willing to disavow the kid? When Qui-Gon insisted on training him anyway, why did he refuse to even consider the trivial effort needed to rescue Anakin’s mother, guaranteeing the kid would never be able to stop worrying about her and let go of his attachment? Why make it so clear that Anakin was only valuable as a Force-powered asset, and that his mother’s freedom, dignity, and life were beneath Jedi notice?</p>

<p id="cWRyCH">Indara and her crew in <em>The Acolyte</em> are just as cold about Mae and Osha. If the coven’s beliefs or behaviors are somehow harmful and dangerous in a way we never see, the Jedi should be trying to rescue the girls, regardless of whether they test as valuable assets. If the coven isn’t dangerous or harmful, the Jedi have no business stealing their children, or circumnavigating the coven to lure their kids into a potentially permanent career path that will start with isolation and indoctrination. And the testing being mandatory and the coven being illegal both suggest that if Mae and Osha test as potentially useful to the Jedi, they aren’t going to be permitted to choose to stay on Brendok.</p>
<p id="Mka5fw">It’s still possible (though given Star Wars franchise history, I doubt it) that <em>The Acolyte</em> is embracing fans’ discomfort with the Jedi’s questionable, distasteful, and even predatory way of handling children, and exploring it with an eye toward clearing up some of the questions. We won’t find out for sure until we get to the parts of the story<strong> </strong>this episode deliberately obscures.</p>
<p id="CiNL3D">Until then, fans have their own ways of exploring these dubious aspects of the franchise. My RPG group resolved our own immediate crisis just before <em>The Acolyte</em> premiered, by aiding our own local Jedi in brokering a local peace, fighting the out-of-control Commerce Guild forces to a standstill, and helping resolve the imbalance in the Force that her hubris had caused. But that leaves us at the start of a new arc, where dozens of children are scattered throughout the Jedi training system, isolated from each other and their families, and undergoing “training” they didn’t necessarily sign up for. </p>
<p id="uxi07z">To me, at least, that situation feels like an entirely fair reflection of what the official canon has said about the Jedi and their youngling inductees. Within Star Wars canon, it feels like a given that the Jedi are always the heroes, and anyone who resists them is acting out of stupidity, greed, or outright evil. But the way they deal with children has always felt potentially villainous. We’ll see soon enough whether <em>The Acolyte</em>’s creative team agrees, or are just teasing us with a little more fuel for a long-standing debate, while planning to gloss over the whole issue and move on without answering any of the questions it leaves standing open. </p>

That is the premise of <em>Starward Vector</em>, which gives your new Sleeper command of one of those prized ships (albeit a slightly banged-up one) with which they can eke out a living while running from their previous owner.<br></p><p>With the aid of a friend and possession of a stolen ship, my Sleeper manages to find brief safety at the beginning of the preview in a small spaceport.

My first drive (or mission objective) is to fix the ship. </p><figure id="" data-id="31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-recommend-id="image://31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-recommend-id="image://31a84df4070d4e63dbb4006109fe3bc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character screen shows skill trees for the Operator class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Starward Vector</em> is built on the same core systems as the original game: exploring points on a map, completing skill checks with the five available dies provided at the beginning of every cycle, and talking to characters that inhabit the world. While my hands-on preview only consisted of one spaceport and its surrounding area (we will get to that later) developer Gareth Damian Martin showed off a brief look at the larger map of the game over a video call, revealing close to a dozen systems players will eventually be able to travel between, each with their own ports, stations, and stories to uncover.<br></p><p>After working some odd jobs and chatting up workers at the local dive, I find my way to a merchant with the parts I need. I can get it if I have the money (which I obviously do not, as it is hard to come by early on) or I can do a risky salvage job in exchange for the goods I need. Job it is. </p><h2 id="h243"><a id=""></a><strong>Odd jobs</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-recommend-id="image://236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-recommend-id="image://236a9b2b97627efca50fb96f7cd34ba9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark desolate rock with multiple pieces of broken ships orbiting it" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This job is a contract, a new feature in <em>Starward Vector</em> centered around the opportunities owning a ship opens up to you. You’ll have contracts available to complete in the area of space surrounding a port or station, which will reward you with money or resources. This job required me to go out to an abandoned ship and hunt down its core. In my first playthrough, I received this contract and immediately flew out to the ship. Once on the ship, the usual list of tasks pops on screen. After a series of poor rolls,resulting in several failures, I notice a counter quickly creeping up. It indicates the damage to the ship, and I am informed that if that counter reaches its maximum the ship will break apart.<br></p><p>To make it worse, with each cycle I spend on the ship new issues are popping up—including a leak in the hull. This stretches my dice rolls thin as I balance them between finishing the job and keeping the ship together, which is made worse as the job stretches across cycles and my Sleeper starts starving to death because I didn’t properly stock up on supplies. That is where the crisis system comes into play. The more I starve, the more stressed my Sleeper becomes and the riskier dice rolls are. Not because I might fail them, but because a dice might break, making it even more prone to failure. Once it has broken three times, the dice will fully become unusable (until manually repaired). </p><figure id="" data-id="46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-recommend-id="image://46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-recommend-id="image://46780961393fdba42cbef2e6e51a4781" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A salvage mission shows multiple tasks and crew mates attempting to complete the mission" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a dangerous evolution of the stabilizer system which required a steady dose of the rare medication every few cycles in order to keep all of your dice but lacked real friction as you progressed further into the game. The crisis system is a little more luck-based and not as easy to fix when it is so far gone. All of these knocks against me added up and a final failed skill check which caused the ship to break apart and had me quickly flying back to safety with nothing but a failed contract.<br></p><p>In my next playthrough, I learned from my mistakes. I stock up on supplies, which are consumed every cycle while out on a contract, and also made sure to fully explore the port before leaving. This led me to encounter more of the game’s characters, which now have an extra utility not seen in the first game: they can serve as crew members on jobs. Like the Sleeper, characters now have certain affinities for certain skills and when on a job they even get to roll two of their own dies for you to use as you see fit. It helps give you an edge on tough jobs. But characters aren’t just tools for you to use for your benefit.</p><h2 id="h244"><a id=""></a><strong>I’m putting together a crew</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-recommend-id="image://644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-recommend-id="image://644191d3ee29e2d90425bd0b795f070a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three character portraits are shown under a &quot;select crew&quot; prompt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The people you meet in the original <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> were a major highlight of the game. Amongst <em>Starward Vector’s stars</em>, that still holds true, and each character has their own motivations and desires. As the captain of a ship, you have something people want and they will try to use you the way you are using them. They also have their own baggage. Picking up certain crew members will inadvertently get you put on somebody’s shit list, which will bite you in the ass later if you aren’t careful. You also have to play peacekeeper between your crew, as not everybody gets along. This system is a direct response to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/citizen-sleeper-gareth-martin-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/citizen-sleeper-gareth-martin-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gareth Damian Martin’s criticism</a></span> of RPGs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-2-review-once-more-unto-the-breach-5456089&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-2-review-once-more-unto-the-breach-5456089"><em>Mass Effect 2</em></a></span>, which they see as casting the player as a glorified super cop who doesn’t take the party’s feelings into account. Previously they joked that Commander Shepard reminds them of bosses they’ve had (not in a good way) and<em> Starward Vector</em> challenges the player to not be that shitty boss. Even while you are on the run, you have a newfound responsibility to your crew<br></p><p>Some crew will be locked to certain stations, while others have ships of their own and will wander the systems at the same time you do, only briefly crossing paths in your narrative. To further boost the risk of character interaction the dialogue moments of the game are occasionally interspersed with choices tied to skill checks, a new feature in <em>Starward Vector</em>. Juni, a crew member I had picked up for the risky salvage job, revealed to me during our mission that she was taking the salvage for herself. This put us in conflict and I was given the option to attempt to wrestle the core from her. It felt like a desperate action, but my Sleeper’s life was in danger so I made that choice. I held my breath as I waited for the skill check and released it when I succeeded. But I felt like absolutely shit after I then left Juni on the abandoned ship as punishment for her betrayal. I had succeeded in the mission but still felt like I had lost, and the moment-to-moment of the job’s many cycles was still full of tension.</p><h2 id="h245"><a id=""></a><strong>High-risk, high-reward</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-recommend-id="image://2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-recommend-id="image://2b4c4c0c7c9b810620df3edce971d149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl floats in space dressed in courier's garb" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That tension is the defining feeling of <em>Starward Vector</em>.

It’s intoxicating<br></p><p>After spending a handful of hours playing and replaying <em>Starward Vector</em>’spreview build was shocked by how many more systems are in this game than its predecessor.

That’s the dream of Gareth Damian Martin. “I want to see people going ‘I finished <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span>, what do I play next?’ And people say Citizen Sleeper 2,” they confess, “I want it to be absolutely irrefutable that <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> is an RPG.” </p><hr><p>Based on what I’ve played so far, I can say that nobody will be able to make that mistake, and that bold comparison to 2023’s most impressive RPG may not be as lofty as you expect. For now, I’ll have to patiently wait to get back to my journey amongst the stars when <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector </em>releases in early 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US labor union Communications Workers of America (CWA) has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Lionbridge Technologies, Inc.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CWA press release reveals</a> that the 160-strong QA team in Boise, Idaho, who provided QA testing for Activision, believes they were laid off in retaliation for attempting to unionize. In addition to the layoffs, it’s also been alleged that Lionbridge “offered workers a severance package that required them to agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act. This practice&nbsp;has been ruled unlawful by the NLRB.”</p>



<p>Workers on the project were told by Lionbridge that the reason for their termination was that the project they were working on had ended; however, teams based in Mexico and Poland continue to work on it.</p>



<p>The CMA also outlined that Lionbridge has a documented history of past union-busting efforts. “In 2016, it laid off all the members of a union&nbsp;in Bellevue, Wash., shortly after workers finalized a first collectively bargained contract with the company. That unit also provided subcontracted labor to Microsoft”, says the CWA. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and Activision for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enis has announced that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.</p>

<p>In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu),&nbsp;Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-fans-arent-happy-bethesdas-charging-6-for-a-single-creation-mission<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> players have left a flurry of negative reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a> - more than 500 in the last 48 hours - following the launch of the game's Creations storefront. 
</p>
<p>
While the Creation Kit is free to download, this method of adding customised content to the game also opens the doors to paid add-ons built by both Bethesda and fans. And it's one of these - a <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/4bf1a31f-46d5-47bf-a5e6-d0f9e2496d0c/Trackers_Alliance__The_Vulture">single mission named The Vulture</a> priced at 700 Starfield Creation Credits (roughly £6.30) that has prompted the current ruckus. 
</p>
<p>
For starters, this is the second mission in the Trackers Alliance series (the first, titled The Starjacker is free) and it sounds like Bethesda has more on the way. Players have criticised the relatively high price for a single quest, and that this opens the door to more in the future. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>"New missions have been added to Starfield as part of this update," Bethesda wrote in its latest blog post. "Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!
</p>
<p>"The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?"</p>
<p>
Head on into the Creations menu, however, and it's here you discover you now need to cough up about £6. There's also the issue that you can't actually cough up £6, as Starfield Creation Credits are only sold in specific amounts, meaning you actually have to cough up £9 for 1000 Credits and sit there with 300 Credits left over. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?author_displayname=BethesdaGameStudios">Bethesda currently has a half dozen items to acquire from its Creation Kit storefront</a> and some of them are free, to help sweeten the deal (a new spacesuit, observatory building and gun skin). You can also pay 300 Credits (hey, you can use up those left over ones!) on a Constellation Plushie Set, or another full 1000 Credits/£9's worth on an Ancient Mariner Module.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"Really? Another push for curated paid mods no one asked for?" wrote one reviewer. "£7 for a single quest is absurd. The game isn't even finished I still routinely get enemies clipping through the geometry," wrote another. "Not recommended until these $7 single mission experiments end," wrote a third. "Would have recommended right up til that decision. Modders make better content for free in a fraction of the time."
</p>
<p>
Further off, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">still planning to launch Starfield's first proper expansion this year</a> at some point - though last week's Xbox Games Showcase did not provide a specific date. Shattered Space will offer a fresh mystery involving the snake-loving House Va'ruun, at some point later in 2024.

            <p>Visions of Mana, the next entry in Square Enix's Mana series, is set to release this summer.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the company revealed the game will launch on 29th August, across <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008215/">PlayStation 5, PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/visions-of-mana/9nj5wv40pd08">Xbox series X/S</a>, and PC via Windows and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">Steam</a>. Pre-orders are available now. Despite earlier confusion, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-not-coming-to-game-pass-xbox-confirms">not be coming to Game Pass</a> on its debut.</p>
<p>Today's announcement came with a new Visions of Mana release date trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>"Every four years, people around the world are selected by the Faerie to travel to the Tree of Mana and rejuvenate the flow of mana power by offering their souls. These chosen people are named 'alms' and accompanied on their pilgrimage by a soul guard," Square Enix wrote in a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look?utm_source=sqex-social&amp;utm_content=launchdatetrailerblog&amp;utm_campaign=VisionsofMana">Visions of Mana blog post</a>, explaining what its upcoming game is about.</p>
<p>"In the Fire Village, Tianeea, the residents are excitedly preparing for the coming of the Faerie and the naming of their new alm. Val, a new soul guard, brings his childhood friend, Hinna, to the festival. As the sun falls beneath the horizon, the Faerie descends and names Hinna as the Alm of Fire. So, Val and Hinna set out towards the Mana Tree, and the journey of a lifetime begins..."</p>
<p>On its release this August, Visions of Mana will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-announces-visions-of-mana-out-next-year">first game in the Mana series for over 15 years</a>. Our Ed has already been hands-on with the upcoming game, but while he said it was a "fun, bubbly, frivolous experience", he also believed it lacks some truly fresh ideas.</p>
<p>"It's balancing old and new, then, and embracing a sort of breezy retro simplicity. Pleasing as that is, though, it so far feels a little shallow by comparison to other genre heavy-hitters," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-returns-to-series-roots-but-is-yet-to-flower-into-a-truly-original-experience">Eurogamer's Visions of Mana preview</a> earlier this year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-current-unreal-engine-5-can-run-at-native-4k-resolution-with-decent-performance-due-to-engine-design.898980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's no current Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can run at native 4K resolution with acceptable performance, but that has nothing to do with developers but rather with how the engine is built.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Infuse Studio co-founder Jacob Sutton discussed the idea that some users have that upscaling solutions such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS are being used as a crutch for developers to fix optimization issues, saying that upscaling is sort of becoming a requirement, using the Unreal Engine 5 as an example. Epic's engine comes with an upscaling software solution called TSR, Temporal Super Resolution, and a feature that is implemented by default is not a bonus but, essentially, a requirement. With upscaling built-in, there's no current Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can run at native 4K with decent performance because it is expected that upscaling is used to achieve desirable framerates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Performance, PS5 Pro, AMD Zen 5 | Spirit of the North 2 Devs | Broken Silicon 261" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcPdwhz705o?start=5020&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That current games powered by Unreal Engine 5 are rather demanding is no surprise, as there have been titles using the full range of features, such as Nanite and Lumen, that struggle to run smoothly, especially on consoles. Multiple tech demos are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-abandoned-manor-demo-rtx-4080-limits-hardware-lumen/">pushing current powerful GPUs like NVIDIA RTX 4080 to the limit</a> in terms of performance at 4K resolution, so it will be very interesting to see how the engine and upscaling solutions will improve to provide smooth gaming experiences even in highly demanding titles.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.4. You can learn more about the changes introduced by it on the engine's <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battle-aces-preview-rts-that-gets-straight-to-point<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tactical depth coupled with its epic scale makes the RTS genre unmatched in some ways, though it can sometimes feel way too intimidating or take too much time to get to the action. <em>Battle Aces </em>is here to solve that problem.</p>
<h2>Battle Aces is RTS Made Easy, Not Simply</h2>
<p><em>Battle Aces </em>is an RTS that sees matches take place in just 10 minutes. That is likely a shockingly low number to RTS veterans, but that's part of the point. A game of<em> Battle Aces</em> is quick, on average lasting just five minutes according to the developer.</p>
<p>To get to that short match length, a lot of the RTS trappings have been stripped away. There is no base building to worry about, the tech upgrades are streamlined to just two paths, and you don't need to worry about managing workers.</p>

<p>Even things like expansion bases are automated. With the hit of a button, you'll slap down a new expansion base that will auto-generate workers to start getting resources going for you.</p>
<p>When you do that, your opponent knows you've expanded as well, so they can try to counter that themselves if they wish. What this often means is that you and your opponent are on relatively equal terms with resource generation, so it becomes who can use them better.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still send off a pack of units to kill some workers to interrupt their economy. If that happens to you, <em>Battle Aces</em> will take care or replacing workers for you.</p>
<p>That is just one of many examples where <em>Battle Aces </em>has the philosophy of taking care of anything that may distract you from the action of the game. Producing a sizeable army happens quickly, and then the game becomes all about using them to their maximum effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Armies Grow Quickly and Clash Often</h2>
<p>Unit production is near instantaneous, so losing group of units isn't immediately devastating -- though still a big deal. You can try to recover quickly enough by producing more units in a snap. On the flip side, it gives you the opportunity to defend yourself quickly if you're caught out.</p>
<p>One thing to remember about unit production, however, is that it is tied to the main, core base. Units are produced from that structure, so backing up an expansion a ways down the map will be a little more difficult.</p>
<p>Once I got back into the RTS swing, getting more comfortable with hotkeys and the muscle memory of moving a bunch of units around, I was completely enthralled by <em>Battle Aces</em>.</p>
<p>I didn't know this was something I wanted, but it scratched that itch of playing an RTS that I wanted every time I played but couldn't always accomplish. Competently building an effective army, and feeling like I had the ability to recover from mistakes, isn't easy in most RTS games.</p>
<p><em>Battle Aces</em> helps take away that RTS anxiety I know a lot of people, myself included, have experienced. There was nothing more panic-inducing that waiting for a <em>Starcraft II</em> match to start. Will I make a mistake in the optimal build sequence, thus screwing me over? Will I look real dumb for doing things "incorrectly'?</p>
<p>Here,<em> Battle Aces</em> is all about the battles themselves. You build up an army and then strategize from there, whether that is through positioning something for flanks, getting around enemies to their base, or whatever scenarios you can dream up.</p>
<p>What's funner than seeing two massive armies duke it out, hundreds of units with bullets, missiles, and more flying through the air?</p>

<p>A large part of the strategy in <em>Battle Aces</em> is going to simply come from the unit composition, of course. There is a deck-like system where you select up to 8 units, which will form the pool of units you can use in a match.</p>
<p>At the start of a match, you can see what your opponent has so you can plan accordingly what tech upgrades or what units you want to use to counter theirs.</p>
<p>Learning a familiarity with those units, their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, and more will have huge factors on success in the game.</p>
<p>Not all units have abilities, but I saw some classics show up like one that hastened movement and attack speed, another that let units blink on the map. One interesting wrinkle to consider is that air units can shoot on the move -- all of them.</p>
<h2>10 Minute Matches Ratchet the Tension</h2>
<p>A final thing I want to circle back on is the 10 minute timer for matches. That 10 minutes is a hard cap, and some interesting things happen before the game ends.</p>
<p>First, at eight minutes all of the workers die at your main base and will not return. That means if you haven't expanded, or those bases have been destroyed, you're pretty screwed.</p>
<p>At nine minutes, a fighting game-like meter shows up at the top of the screen assigning a percentage "win" meter to each player. That gives the losing player one final minute to try to make up for lost ground.</p>
<p>The percentage of winning is determined by the efficiency of your resource gathering. Basically, the math is how many units you've lost versus resources used.</p>
<h2>Battle Aces Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Battle Aces</em> is one of those games that will reward you for just how much you put into it. It is simple to pick up and go, and those that really want to dig into the optimal army composition and learn how to adjust on the fly will find a lot to love here.</p>

Initial results for publishers like Square Enix and Rockstar Games revealed entries with code names for games that haven’t been announced yet, or don’t currently have PC versions. Fans have been combing through the names and looking at corresponding data like cloud save file paths, file sizes, and associated DLC to speculate about what the mystery listings might be. </p><p>One is called “Momo” and appears to be for a long-rumored<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> remake. That’s because associated DLC listings describe things like “Tetra Master Starter Pack” and “Thief’s Knives.” There is also a separate listing for “Skobeloff” which fans believe to be the PC port of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>. Other listings from other publishers also point to potential surprises. One entry called “Semla” under Rockstar Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be</a></span> the rumored PC port of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, given a reportedly similar file size with the recent remaster of the game for consoles. </p><p>Saber Interactive, meanwhile, appears to have a hidden Epic Games Store entry that simply reads “Turok,” giving some fans hope that the dino-hunting classic might finally get a new sequel. Other codenamed entries are less surprising, like “Rhodeisland” which is possibly the upcoming PC port of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. The whole thing has led fans on a wild scavenger hunt searching for publisher codenames and trying to deduce what unannounced projects or ports they might be for.</p><p>It’s reminiscent of the massive Nvidia leak years ago, which included entries so shocking, like <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, that many presumed it to be an elaborate fake. One-by-one, however, many (though not all) of those leaked games were proven to be real. It’s always possible that some of the entries mined from the Epic Games Store are fake, speculative, or serving the purpose of a placeholder. But the fact that many are codenames rather than actual game titles has many convinced these are real projects that Epic Games just accidentally exposed. </p><p>A spokesperson for Epic said the company has since patched the store overnight to prevent further data scraping. “We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog,” they told Kotaku in an email. The website for the EpicDB tool also now reports that the Cloudflare server for it is down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Moves come in a variety of types, such as magic spells or traps.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_040.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Abilities</strong></p><p>Abilities can improve character stats such as attack or defense, as well as a variety of other effects that aid the party in battle.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_041.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_042.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Starter Classes</strong></p><p>Starter class refers to the class a character assumes when not equipped with an elemental vessel.</p><p>Maxing out the elemental plot of a single element will allow the starter class to equip weapons which were previously unable to equip, assign abilities not native to their class, and use class strikes from other classes.</p><p>Certain items can be also used to expand the plot, granting the character access to a higher tier of powerful moves.</p><p><strong>■ Battles: Ring Menu and Shortcuts</strong></p><p>Moves—powerful maneuvers that cost MP to execute—can be utilized from the ring menu, a <em>Mana</em> series staple. Only moves that have been set to the ring menu can be used in battle, so it’s important to consider both the team line-up and your personal play style when customizing your ring menu. Combat will pause while the ring menu is open, giving you time to plan out your next move.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_043.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_044.jpg"></a></figure><p>↓</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_045.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Visions-of-Mana_2024_06-12-24_046.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to the ring menu, shortcuts are another way to instantly execute moves or access items.

Treyarch production director Yale Miller said in an interview that he hopes this feature will become standard across Call of Duty games going forward. Miller also said it's a bigger hope for Treyarch that other studios embrace a similar kind of feature in their own games.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-how-treyarch-wants-black-ops-6s-new-movement-system-to-change-the-genre/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">group interview attended by VGC</a>, Miller said "time will tell" if the omnimovement system is enjoyed and embraced by players. "We think of it that way--if it's great, people are going to want it," Miller said.</p>

<p>He added that people might find the feature appealing in part because it's based in reality, not fiction. "It's more actually making it capable for you as a player to do all the things that actual people can do," he said.</p><p>Miller went on to say that he expects people to find ways to exploit the omnimovement system, which is why he's excited for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta</a> to go live so people can try it out and Treyarch can gather feedback.</p><p>"It's our hope that it becomes a standard. I think if it's really good, it won't just become the standard for other Call of Duty games. Hopefully we do something, just like we play other games and go,' That's dope, we want to try that in our game, how can we put our spin on it?' We hope it's viewed that way as well," Miller said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985" data-ratio="0.56038647342995" data-width="621" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985"></a><figcaption>A scene from the Black Ops 6 campaign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316986,1300-4316987,1300-4316988,1300-4316989,1300-4316990" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"></figure><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/which-xbox-and-summer-game-fest-games-grabbed-the-most-headlines<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Fancensus offers an analysis into the most covered games in the 24-hour periods that followed by Geoff Keighley's and Microsoft's annual showcases</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It was quite the week for the games industry with not one, not two, but… well many live shows and events occurring last week with more still to come later this month.</p>
<p>Arguably two of the biggest were Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, which aired on Friday, and the Xbox Games Showcase, which went live on Sunday – both promising big announcements and fresh looks at upcoming software.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Geoff would preface his show via a Twitch Q&amp;A with a clarification that this year’s Summer Game Fest would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-kingdom-hearts-and-more-wont-be-at-summer-game-fest">focus more on already announced titles</a> as opposed to juggernaut premiers. It was a smart move in hindsight; the general feedback rather critical of the show with over 40% of over 250,000 gamers rating it a D grade and under 10% an A grade (according to <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1799214921038901715">Geoff’s own poll on X).</a></p>
<p>A couple days later Xbox would deliver one of its best showcases in years, at a point where it sorely needed it, with a number of high-profile games shown releasing in 2024, 2025 and beyond. Again, another of <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1799875321879281925">Geoff’s polls on X</a> would emphasise just how well received the event had been with a massive 65% giving it an A grade (from over 163,000 respondents and counting).</p>
<p>But how did the games do with press? Which ones were making headlines and stealing the spotlight following the two shows?</p>
<p>Rather than just considering quantity of articles, Fancensus’ Flare Score also considers numerous other metrics including reach of approximately 3,000 featured websites, the split between headlining articles and those that merely mention the title, and presence of articles on a website's front page. Essentially, it gives an overall performance that focuses on quality and not just quantity awarding a score out of 100.</p>
<p>When examining the 24-hour window following each of the two respective shows, it's clear that Xbox Games Showcase had the bigger impact with press; the top five scoring titles all featured in this show, with a further three more featuring in the top ten.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 saw with the biggest success, scoring not only the highest Flare Score overall but doing so by a huge margin, likely a result of it having its own showing following the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>
<p>Looking over the entire list, two things are evident; the first being Summer Game Fest was a weaker show in terms of big name titles and fresh new reveals (with the exception of Lego Horizon Adventures and a couple other arguable notable announcements), the Flare Scores of featured games perhaps reflective of Geoff’s comments.</p>
<p>Xbox, meanwhile, came out the gate guns blazing, the true strength of the mammoth lineup of purchased studios it has really being felt. Activision Blizzard, MachineGames, Id Software, Compulsion Games, Playground Games … all with something to show, and something big at that.</p>
<p>The second takeaway is that despite the industry going through what feels like a tumultuous time, that hasn’t slowed established franchises from making their presence known. 17 of the Top 20 titles featured are from existing franchises/brands.</p>
<p>With embargoes due to drop throughout the week, it’ll be interesting to see the tail on some of these games outside their initial 24 hour performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest adventure in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>series is coming pretty soon.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on August 29th, which means this is the longest&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>series fans have ever had to wait for a new mainline installment.</p>
<p>Prior to&nbsp;<em>Visions</em>, several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release">mobile games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-files-trademark-for-collection-of-mana-in-europe">collections</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trials-of-mana-remake-gets-april-release-date">remakes</a> of prior&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>games were released, but this is the first fully new&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>game to be released in 18 years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=ZkPtZAIi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=pnBkCjsh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>is the first new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>game in 18 years.</figcaption></figure><p>The new launch trailer sets up the story for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, shows off some of the combat, and also introduces us to the game's five playable characters.</p>
<p>Protagonist Val's childhood friend Hinna is chosen to be an Alm, a person who must give their soul to the Mana Tree in order to "rejuvenate the flow of mana power", per the Steam page.</p>
<p>She seems to be harboring doubts, however; she expresses a desire to remain and "keep making memories" with Val, so it looks like we're dancing the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X&nbsp;</em>foxtrot again.</p>
<p>Other playable characters include Oracle of Wind Careena, Radiant Sword Morley, Queen of the Deep Palamena, and Woodland Custodian Julei, and you'll be able to build a three-person party based on the combination you prefer.</p>

<p>Each character will bring their own combat style, and you'll need to experiment in order to discover which characters work best for certain enemies and boss encounters. Hinna, however, won't be playable; she'll play a sideline support role, <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look">per Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>If you know&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>well, you'll be pleased to know that the iconic Ring Menu is making a return, and you'll need to assign moves to it if you want to use them in combat.</p>
<p>There's also a class system that allows you to access powerful elemental attacks, healing spells, and battle-altering buffs and debuffs, so finding the right class for each character is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008215/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pre-order-visions-of-mana/9PCV22TJT44T/0017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 29th.

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-samurai">Disco Samurai</a> is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got <em>groove</em>.</p>

<p>In the time it takes you to read this, you could grab the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576410/Disco_Samurai/">demo</a>, and become about 4% better at the game. You’ll need that 4%.</p>
<p>Unlike other rhythm combat games I’ve played, slashing off-beat doesn’t reduce your score here. Instead, you just won’t attack. The music itself is crunchy 4/4 techno, so nothing too hard to wrap your head around. (Why not disco? you ask. It takes place in a town <em>called</em> Disco, I respond, just as perplexed.) Parrying works the same way. Only on-beat deflections are successful, though you’ll know when one is coming due to an indicator. Each foe has a stamina meter, and they’ll enter a cartoony star-headed stun state once you whittle it down with parries, slashes, and some other moves I’ll get to in a sec.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to dent your lovely katana though, you can just dash. Again, only on the beat. We chop off left feet ‘round these parts. I’m not entirely sure why you <em>would</em> dodge, since it doesn’t affect your foe’s stamina meter, but maybe it comes into play more later. As you perform hits, dodges, and parries, you’ll gradually build up a flow meter. What happens when you build enough? A gun. A gun happens. You get about four shots per full meter with the default pistol, so this is less of a super move and more something you can weave in to your repertoire. If you want to spend a bigger chunk of flow, you can kick. Vases and other environmental objects make lovely smashing sounds, and also do big damage. Love a good 'big sound, big damage' combo, me.</p>
<p>You’ll die <em>very</em> quickly if you start making mistakes, especially as whiffing moves seems to embolden the besuited bastards trying to kill you into attacking harder. But you will get your health back after each short, single-room stage. Much of the time, those deaths will come from overhead attacks. These are entirely unfair (read: I’m bad at them) slashes that you’ll have to hold the parry for exactly one beat to block. It’s the weaving of these attacks into regular attack patterns that keeps your foes both deadly and satisfying to overcome. After all, you only ever feel as super a sword bastard as the sword bastards you’re making look foolish, as my favourite bible verse goes.</p>
<p>I’ve had issues with feeling overly restricted with rhythm combat in the past. I bounced off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-hellsinger">Metal: Hellsinger</a> for this reason, but I’m not getting that with Disco Samurai. A better critic than me once observed that a great joy of games is the feeling of performing a role well - acting out stealth so good it befits Solid Snake, or ripping and tearing without hesitation, just as the real Doom Guy would after he gets off his shift at Argos. That’s the deal here, I think. You don’t have much leeway for self-expression, but the rhythm and danger coaxes you into some deeply engaging choreography. Sometimes, life is too much samurai, not enough disco, but I reckon this one has the balance down pat.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-summer-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a>, the next entry in Square Enix's popular action role-playing game series, is launching in a little over two months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>A new trailer shared today, which provides a new look at the game's world, characters, and action-based combat system, confirmed an August 29th release date on PC via Steam and Windows Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Visions of Mana will be the first new entry in the Mana series, Seiken Densetsu in Japan, in over fifteen years. While the story doesn't seem to move past the boundaries set in previous entries in the series, involving a journey to the Tree of Mana to rejuvenate the flow of mana power, the vibrant visuals and a more action-oriented approach to combat are set to make the game stand out from the rest of the series, although it will be interesting to see if it will be able to replicate the quality of some of the best entries in the series like Trials of Mana.</p>
<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. More information on the game can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">Steam store page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-rivals-preview-out-for-overwatchs-crown<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is a fitting name for the upcoming hero shooter by Netease, because I daresay this game will rival&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, we got a chance to play a few rounds of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</em>This is an objective-based hero shooter, but you should be familiar with a lot of the cast -- they are, after all, many of Marvel's all-stars as playable characters.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are at all familiar with&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, you'll be right at home with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Both games share similar objectives and follow that same core philosophy when it comes to heroes and abilities, but there's enough here to be its own game.</p>

<h2>A Hero for Everyone</h2>
<p>The roster is, of course, split into three roles: vanguard (tank), duelist (DPS), and strategist (healer).&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;does distinguish itself in that its from a third-person perspective not unlike&nbsp;<em>Smite,&nbsp;</em>but at its core, this is a hero shooter.</p>
<p>And this game is all about the heroes. I'm a big fan of the cast -- you have both recognizable characters as well as some that are more niche and less well-known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spider-Man and Hulk are some of the most recognizable characters around, so it's nice to see Luna Snow, Namor, and some others as a contrast to this.</p>

<p>Heroes have a set of abilities, and the logic mostly follows that of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Like you have an ability to aid in mobility, an ultimate, so on and so forth. Some of these are super bombastic and battles truly do feel like a bunch of super heroes clashing.</p>
<p>You'll even see the effect of battle on the environment. I caught a glimpse of a building taking substantial damage from all the chaos. Not to mention,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' art style is excellent, colorful look as if plucked right out from the pages of a comic book.</p>
<p>My several games went about as well as I'd hoped. It was super quick to adapt and get used to the controls, and the characters I played all felt faithful to their character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scarlet Witch, for instance, uses magic as her primary ability with this sort of siphon ability, and can launch magic missiles, too. Rocket makes heavy use of his technology and can heal enemies with alt-fire -- as a nice little detail, he can hop on the back of Groot.</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;is a shockingly good time. After being a little jaded by&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>, this seems like a perfectly suitable alternative, even if you aren't a huge Marvel fan.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Last year, Atari resurrected its classic Atari 2600 home console with the all-new Atari 2600+, which features modernized touches like HDMI output and USB ports while maintaining the original's look and functionality. The refreshed retro console has been out for less than a year, but just got its first discount over <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7LMFKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Amazon</a>. You can grab it for just $115 (was $130).</p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, the Atari 2600+ looks almost identical to the original machine that first launched in the US back in 1977. Everything from the wood panel faceplate and chunky metal switches to the simple wired joystick and retro font is authentically recreated. But thanks to built-in HDMI and widescreen support, you can plug the Atari 2600+ into modern TVs and monitors.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4317493-atari2600plushero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317493" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4317493-atari2600plushero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317493"></a><figcaption>Atari 2600+ with 10-in-1 game cartridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4317493-atari2600plushero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Atari 2600+ can play original Atari 2600 and 7800 games, and ships with a special 10-in-1 cartridge featuring some of the system's most popular titles, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Yar's Revenge</li><li dir="ltr">Missile Command</li><li dir="ltr">Adventure</li><li dir="ltr">Combat</li><li dir="ltr">Dodge 'Em</li><li dir="ltr">Haunted House</li><li dir="ltr">Maze Craze</li><li dir="ltr">Realsports Volleyball</li><li dir="ltr">Surround</li><li dir="ltr">Video Pinball</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Considering how much of a pain it is to play those games on the original hardware with modern TVs, the Atari 2600+ is a welcome alternative that streamlines the process.

<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than well received reveal trailer</a>, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> appears to have curried some favour back thanks to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-shows-varrics-tragic-loss-of-bianca-at-solas-hands-and-eldritch-demons-from-the-veil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its gameplay trailer</a>, which confirmed a number of key details about the game. BioWare has since shared more information, including how this <em>Dragon Age</em> will be noticeably more linear than its predecessor.</p> <p data-characters="695" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN</a> during an extended preview of the game, director Corinne Busche explained how, for <em>The Veilguard</em>, the development team opted for a “mission-based structure.” By comparison, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dragon-age-inquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> had a semi-open world structure, consisting of multiple areas players could freely explore. Given the industry’s slight obsession with crafting large open worlds for people to run around in, I’m surprised BioWare has decided to go in the opposite direction for the new <em>Dragon Age</em>, but Busche said this will be to the game’s benefit: “We believe that’s how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via BioWare</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">That’s also not to say players will be railroaded from one objective to the next. Some missions will offer more opportunities for exploration than others, with optional content, hidden secrets, and branching paths to discover. As Busche said, “It does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.” In addition, she provided light details on <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s side-quests, sharing one example about investigating a missing family which lets you search for clues in a bog area.</p>
 <p data-characters="684" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">I’m sure some will be disappointed to not get the opportunity to freely roam <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s setting of the Tevinter Imperium region. But this mission-based structure is not too dissimilar to what BioWare did with the much lauded <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mass-effect-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect 2</a></em>. I reckon most players will be fine with it as long as the story and character writing are on par with the previous games. Plus, it means BioWare can avoid the issues some games with open worlds suffer from. For example, plenty of Ubisoft’s open world settings have been criticised for being littered with so many objectives that they feel like they’re only there to pad the world out and stop it from feeling empty.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">We won’t have to wait much longer to see how well fans take to <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> as the game is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this fall. Given it’s been almost a decade since <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> came out, the wait will hopefully have been worth it.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he understands why many players use guides to help them with the studio's games, but doesn't want them to be a necessity.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/">PC Gamer</a>, Miyazaki said the team expects players to consult guides when playing through its games. "There's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies," he noted.</p>
<p>But, even though the FromSoft team does expect many of its players to turn to a guide or two to help them negotiate the Lands Between and Shadow of the Erdtree's Land of Shadow, the studio still believes players should be able to enjoy its games without additional help.</p>

</figure>
<p>"We obviously understand [players use guides], but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite," he said. "If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future."</p>
<p>Miyazaki added that those getting ready to play Shadow of the Erdtree specifically will have plenty of experience with Elden Ring's base game, and therefore the team has "faith that they will be able to continue, find these secrets and overcome these challenges".</p>
<p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with using guides when playing games, and indeed Miyazaki called it a "perfectly valid playstyle".</p>
<p>"We don't necessarily cater to players who are reading guides as they go... we respect those players who like to approach it with a guide in hand. We just want to let you know it's not our prerequisite, designing the game in their favour," he closed.</p>

<p>During last week’s Summer Game Fest showcase, Riot came out guns blazing with a shocking announcement. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-console-release-confirmed-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the console release</a> for their popular first-person shooter, Valorant, with a limited beta rolling out for PlayStation 5 on June 14. </p>



<p>It hasn’t even been a whole week since the announcement, and the leaks have already surfaced. The latest one provides players with the complete console trophy list for Valorant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/valorant-ps5-platinum-trophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Trophies</a>, players will be able to unlock 16 trophies/achievements for Valorant on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. However, players should note that there are no Platinum trophies for Valorant on the  PS5. </p>



<p>Besides that, it is surprising to see that there are more Silver and Gold trophies than Bronze trophies for the console port. In most games, some of these challenges wouldn’t be worth higher than Bronze. Challenges like dealing 500,000 damage or using your Abilities 4,000 times can easily be attained by playing the game long enough, but completing these tasks will fetch you a Gold Trophy. Check out the full list of Valorant’s console trophies/achievements below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Who’s next? – Get 1 Kill (Bronze)</li>



<li>And that’s how it gets done! – Win 1 Game (Bronze)</li>



<li>Right between the eyes. – Get 300 Headshots (Silver)</li>



<li>They’re super dead! – Get 1,000 Headshots (Gold)</li>



<li>That’s going to leave a scar. – Deal 250,000 damage (Silver)</li>



<li>Looks like I got a little carried away. – Deal 500,000 damage (Gold)</li>



<li>Time for a field test. – Use your Abilities 2,000 times (Silver)</li>



<li>Take control. – Use your Abilities 4,000 times (Gold)</li>



<li>Here comes the party! – Use your Ultimate 125 times (Silver)</li>



<li>Must I do everything? – Get an Ace (Gold)</li>



<li>Five in, five out. – Get a Flawless (Gold)</li>



<li>Beep beep beep, enough of that. – Successfully defuse a Spike with less than a second remaining (Silver)</li>



<li>I’m built different. – Earn a Clutch (Silver)</li>



<li>I know exactly where you are. – Get 10 Wallbang Kills (Bronze)</li>



<li>Next time we’ll use wooden sticks! – Get a Thrifty (Silver)</li>



<li>You want to play? Let’s play – Use your Ultimate 300 times (Gold)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, Valorant’s limited beta test goes live in a few days. Players must be in NA, EU, or JP regions to join the test. If you are eligible, sign up for the Valorant console beta through this link or a referral link that comes through a personal invitation from Riot. Lastly, players should own a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X/S. If you are selected for the test, Riot will send you a VAL Console Limited Beta key to download the game on your console.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-store-database-appears-to-list-dozens-of-upcoming-pc-games-including-turok.898911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-database-appears-to-list-dozens-of-upcoming-pc-games-including-turok<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Plus, what may be Red Dead Redemption and The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
A new, unofficial online database of game listings from the Epic Games Store has been launched and promptly rifled through - turning up mention of numerous unannounced PC game projects.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://epicdb.org/">EpicDB</a>, similar to SteamDB, is now offline - after Epic Games itself realised its private store data was being probed.
</p>
<p>
"We released an update tonight so third-party tools can't surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalogue," an Epic Games spokesperson told Eurogamer.
</p>

</div><figcaption>Newscast: For Xbox, could this year finally be the one where it all pays off?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVhT_7O0iE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Many of the games spotted were listed under codenames, though a few were not. Saber Interactive had a listing for a Turok project, for example (though whether this is a new game or remaster is unknown). 
</p>
<p>
Some that were listed under codenames were also easily identifiable. It's publicly known that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">BioShock 4, in development since at least 2019</a>, is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">worked on under the title "Parkside"</a>. This was indeed listed as one of several games in development by publisher 2K.
</p>
<p>
Still others were listed under unknown codenames - though enterprising internet users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/">reddit</a> and video game fan forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/">ResetEra</a> believe they have uncovered what some could be. 
</p>
<p>
A bit of digging in the Epic Store files suggests a Sony Interactive Entertainment project codenamed "Utah" is in fact a The Last of Us Part 2 PC port. (Remember that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-reportedly-pc-ready-and-has-been-for-months">report which recently claimed the game was done and ready</a>, but potentially awaiting the arrival of HBO's next The Last of Us TV season.)
</p>
<p>
More interesting, perhaps, is a project codenamed "Semla" from Rockstar Games. Based on its filesize being close to the filesize of Red Dead Redemption 1 on PS4, there's suggestion that this could be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-1-finally-heading-to-pc-new-datamine-suggests">the mythical PC port of Rockstar's beloved cowboy western</a> that's long been expected. 
</p>
<p>
And then there are other codenames that are just fun to see. Sega currently has in-development projects codenamed "Porridge", "Croquembouche" and "CurlyWurly". Ubisoft has  food-themed ideas for its codenames, including "Puffpastry" and "Profiterole". Saber Interactive has "Chimichanga". And Square Enix has "Butterkaka". Mmmm... time for some lunch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-mission-based-rather-than-open-world-sex-scenes-will-have-nudity/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, BioWare has finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-summer-game-fest-presentation-impressions-back-in-thedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a lot about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy RPG franchise.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there aren't still many unanswered questions. One of those was the degree of openness of the world design. Dragon Age: Inquisition added semi-open world maps, but in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Game Director Corinne Busche hinted that this new game will be less open and more mission-focused by comparison.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated. We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience. However, along the way, these levels that we go to do open up, some of them have more exploration than others. Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of them are highly curated, especially when it involves the motivations and the experiences of the companions. You're really along on this journey with them. Others, you're investigating a missing family… and the entirety of this bog is open up to you. You're searching for clues, finding a way to solve their disappearance. So really it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. But I do want to emphasize that hand-crafted and curated is our approach.</em></p>
<p>This is probably BioWare getting back to its historic strengths after some criticism for the open world design of Inquisition and Mass Effect Andromeda. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Wccftech</a>, BioWare also confirmed there will be a 'tremendous' amount of side content in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Hopefully, that means we'll still have a meaty game on our hands this Fall, even without an open world to explore.</p>

<p>On another note, Busche also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about the romantic relationships that players will be able to develop in the game. Interestingly, companions could get together on their own if you don't romance them yourselves. There will also be some nudity for certain sex scenes, depending on how 'spicy' the companion is.</p>
<p><em>Their past experiences or partners, they'll reference them and indeed who they'll become romantic with. For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly.</em></p>
<p><em>It's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy. Some of them are more spicy than others. Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more... we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual. Of course, we are an M-rated game. We do have nudity.</em></p>
<p>BioWare stressed that the writers have strived to make friendships just as compelling as romances for those players who'd rather stick to that type of relationship.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the studio <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> how it's going to integrate choices made in previous games. Whereas Dragon Age: Inquisition had its own Dragon Age Keep app that could be used to import saves from earlier installments, there won't be any of that here due to the incompatibility between the different clients.</p>
<p>Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has everything baked into the character creator, where players will have the opportunity to fully recreate their own Inquisitor from the previous title. Here, they'll also get to select what happened in their version of the previous stories, and it'll obviously influence the plot in some way.</p>
<p>The developers are targeting a Fall 2024 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It'll likely be around the 10-year anniversary of Inquisition, which occurs between 18 and 20 November.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-should-see-a-fair-amount-of-support-and-ports-but-things-may-change-once-next-gen-consoles-are-out.898905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ports-issues-next-gen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 should see a fair amount of ports and support if its performance will indeed be in the ballpark of the Xbox Series S, but things may drastically change once next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft are out.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead'</a>s Broken Silicon podcast, Taylor Christensen and Jacob Sutton, co-founders of the Spirit of the North series development team Infuse Studio, discussed the next Nintendo gaming system and if it will give the same troubles many developers had porting games to its predecessor. Jacob Stutton said that if the leaked specs are real and the console's performance is comparable to the Xbox Series S, this generation's lowest common denominator, the system should see a fair amount of support and ports. Since current generation multiplatform games have to target the Microsoft console, developers won't have to make huge sacrifices to get their games running on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>This, however, is eventually going to change in the future. As with every recent Nintendo hardware, the Switch 2 is launching in the middle of the current generation, and its specs are likely not going to be high enough for smooth porting once the next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft are out. This happened with the original Switch as well, as the console has trouble running Unreal Engine 4 games without massive sacrifices and is obviously incapable of running Unreal Engine 5 games. In addition, Jacob Stutton highlighted that throwing more hardware doesn't magically solve other issues, such as software being unable to take full advantage of a system's specification, making the example of the Unreal Engine 5.4 update, which only recently introduced better multicore utilization leading to potentially much better performance.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will update you on the system as soon as more information comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is the next big entry into the wide world of <em>Star Wars</em> games, and creative director Julian Gerighty has revealed how long it will take for you to finish the story, and how long completionists will need to spend to find and unlock every single item. </p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false"><em>Outlaws </em>is the first open-world <em>Star Wars</em> game set between the events of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. You won’t be controlling a Jedi though, as instead, you’ll be playing as Kay Vess, a criminal looking to start a new life in the galaxy away from the murky world of delinquent gangs and syndicates. </p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>It’ll take a full day to complete the campaign.

            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA), one of America's largest unions, has filed Unfair Labour Practice charges against Microsoft supplier Lionbridge Technologies.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge">CWA</a>, Lionbridge laid off the entirety of an Idaho-based team, equating to 160 people, after they engaged in union-related activity. This team, the CWA said, provided QA testing for Activision.</p>

<p>
In addition, the CWA stated Lionbridge had offered workers a severance package which "required them to agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act". The CWA says the US National Labor Relations Board has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring">ruled this practise to be unlawful</a>.
</p>
<p>
Those affected were allegedly told their termination was due to their project coming to a close, however the CWA said others on the same project elsewhere remained in employment. It noted that those in Mexico and Poland "continue to work", despite what Lionbridge told the Idaho team about the project coming to an end.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first time the Microsoft supplier has been accused of engaging in what the CWA describes as "union-busting". The same thing happened in 2016, when Lionbridge laid off union members in Bellevue, Washington. This <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/">particular batch of layoffs</a> reportedly happened "shortly after workers finalised a first collectively bargained contract with the company", with the CWA stating: "That unit also provided subcontracted labour to Microsoft."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">“We do much the same work that union-represented Activision QA employees do. Microsoft should make sure that everyone working on its games is treated w/ respect in line w/ its labor principles, including employees of contractors" - Al Bussabarger, former Lionbridge Test Associate <a href="https://t.co/LqtV2hmjlH">https://t.co/LqtV2hmjlH</a></p>— CWA (@CWAUnion) <a href="https://twitter.com/CWAUnion/status/1800537113831858437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
The CWA now wants Microsoft to hold its contractors such as Lionbridge to the same standards the company has set for itself. Two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft signed a labour neutrality agreement with CWA</a>, which would go into effect 60 days after the closure of its then-ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Earlier this month, the CWA and Microsoft announced that they had <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-enters-neutrality-agreement-microsofts-zenimax-studios">extended their labour neutrality agreement to cover workers at ZeniMax Media Inc</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to Microsoft and Activision for further comment on today's report.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice-b-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>On a Monday in early 2018, Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun's deputy editor at the time, handed in his notice. On Thursday that same week, I emailed Alice Bell, a person I'd never spoken to before, to ask if she would consider applying for the role.
</p>
<p>Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.
</p>
<p>Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alice's writing sounds like how I want RPS to sound: funny and smart, yes, but best of all able to be strongly critical while still unafraid to be a fan of a game she loves. These are a mixture of qualities that it's almost impossible to find in a writer, and typically you get an imbalance towards one or t'other: too cynical, or too game-pilled, or funny but insubstantial, or thoughtful but so, so dry.
</p>
<p>Yet the balance is present across Alice's work for the site. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/tfi-friday">TFI Friday</a>. Announcing her love for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-love-you-giant-women-of-the-assassins-creed-odyssey-dlc">giant women</a>. Recurring confusion at video game merch - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-bath-bombs-are-exactly-what-youd-expect">bath bombs</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-everyone-making-terrible-trainers-for-their-video-games">trainers</a>. Coming up with the idea to commission <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-miss-rezzed-so-much-that-we-turned-it-into-a-free-tabletop-rpg">a tabletop RPG based on Rezzed</a>, so readers could experience it when it was cancelled due to the pandemic. Conceiving of and delivering our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apply-to-rock-paper-shotguns-work-experience-programme-for-ethnic-minorities">ethnic minority work experience programme</a>. Her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/moon-diary">Ritual Of The Moon diary</a>, about a game designed to be played for five minutes per day for 28 days. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-electronic-wireless-show">Electronic Wireless Show podcast</a>, the only podcast you need in her opinion (which will return, with Alice still hosting). More reviews and shitposts than I can possibly link to.
</p>
<p>That's not to mention Alice's work behind the scenes. Consider the context of RPS at the time Alice was hired. Back in 2018, we were about to double the size of the team by hiring six people and branching into video, guides and hardware coverage. I told Alice that we'd gently introduce her to the various tasks of her new role, an intention I sincerely held until around 11am on her first day - a change of mind Alice has been giving me shit about for the past six years. I dumped a mountain of work on Alice that day, and while I haven't been editor-in-chief of RPS in a few years, she never let me down while I was.
</p>
<p>I'm conscious that I'm personally getting the balance all wrong here, that this sort of sappy outpouring of praise without jokes is very un-Alice. In a more perfect world, we'd all be roasting her for leaving, but we don't live in that world. Instead, I need to address the redundant elephant in the recently acquired room. Last month, Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Gamer Network was bought by Ziff Davis, and following that transaction the decision was made to cut staff within Gamer Network. Alice's role was one of those cut.
</p>
<p>I can't properly articulate how angry and sad I am about this, and I won't try. I know most of you reading this already feel the same way.
</p>
<p>I'm confident that RPS will be fine, eventually, as it always has been when great people have left before. I'm confident that Alice will be better than fine; Alice is going to conquer the world, as former RPS writers often do. (You should <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/grave-expectations-alice-bell/7424574?ean=9781838958428">buy</a> her <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/displeasure-island-a-grave-expectations-mystery-alice-bell/7661083?ean=9781838958435">novels</a>, if you haven't already.)
</p>
<p>This confidence doesn't make me any less angry or sad. Instead, I'll hold onto the fact I'm friends with Alice outside of work, where I get to experience the best of her: not the supportive, thoughtful colleague everyone describes below, but the funny, gossipy, gleefully mean friend who shares my love of four-hour YouTube videos and obscure internet drama. <em>Thank god I was able to change your mind.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ed:</strong> Back in the golden era of the office days, I remember Alice and I first bonded over Love Island when she heard my former work sidekick James and I talking a bit too loudly about it in our Metabomb corner (the esports site we used to work on). Every morning from then on she'd join us for a quick daily "DID YOU SEE LAST NIGHT" debrief. That's when I knew we'd get along just fine.
</p>
<p>I started at RPS a few years ago, having been absorbed by the first of The Takeovers. I went from an esports-y guides writer who'd done a couple of features for our pals at Eurogamer (cheers to Donlan for giving me a chance), to a staff writer all of a sudden. It was a big change! I knew a few of the folks already, but above all else, Alice really helped me settle in. She took me under her wing, gave me loads of guidance on words and were just like, really nice.
</p>
<p>Over the years she'd land on my work and dissect it in a way that I look back on and think, "Only Alice could've done that". She'd sit with me and explain through clear, concise points how I could improve or rejig or think differently about things - to better my confidence.
</p>
<p>I owe Alice a lot, to be honest. I wouldn't be where I am without her fighting my corner, as she believed I could edit other people's words when I ummed and ahhed over the step up. Later, she'd happily lend me advice on how to manipulate letters so they'd look nice on a page and read much betterer. I'm still working on how I relay those nuggets of word advice to those I work with, but Alice has instilled in me a lot of certainty I didn't have previously. One thing I've taken away which she'd be pleased with: trust my gut when it rumbles. 
</p>
<p>She might think these very words on this very page are a bit daft, or a bit much, or a bit cringe. She should know by now that I am not only fond of cringe, I <em>bathe</em> in cringe. She's probably still got CMS access, so she might try to attack the unpublish button, but as you read this I'm probably fending her off with a copy of Grave Expectations in one hand and Displeasure Island, its sequel, in the other. I grabbed my copies from my local bookstore, so you certainly can too. I could use the help! Oh god, she's about to hit me with The People's Elbow.
</p>
<p>I won't launch into how much she's done for the site itself and for so many others. It's immeasurable, really. Just know that it has been a joy. And will <em>continue</em> to be a joy, as I pester her and distract her from the exciting projects she'll be beavering away at otherwise.  
</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> When Alice B interviewed me for this job and asked what games I was personally looking forward to, I told her one of them was Sherlock Holmes: The Awakening. She replied with an intrigued eyebrow raise and asked 'Really,' as if she too had a bemused appreciation for the rough-around-the-edges feel of Holmes versus Cthulhu as envisioned by Frogwares, a developer you can't help but root for despite the fact that everything they make is sorta falling apart at the edges.
</p>
<p>When I did get this job, I was pleased to find that Alice truly did share snippets of my odd tastes, especially when it comes to underrated adventure games and schlocky movies. It's rare to find a person who appreciates The Legend of Kyrandia 2: Hand of Fate and has actually spent time analysing the plot of Van Helsing, a movie that made the questionable decision of basing its storyline on Dracula's eggs. This potent appreciation of weird is what made Alice such a great writer for this corner of the internet. She will be greatly missed, we are less without her, and next time I play a Frogwares game, I will do so in her honour.
</p>
<p><strong>Nic:</strong> Ah, but can we hire Alice's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-asked-a-lot-of-people-what-would-you-do-to-a-clone-of-yourself">clone</a>? Alice did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-author-and-games-writer-abouter-alice-bell">Booked For The Week</a> for me on Sunday, read that please.
</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> When I arrived at the office on my very first day, Alice immediately made me about 70% less anxious, seemingly without even trying. For the next five years, in between consistently writing some of the best words on the site, she would continue to make RPS feel like a second home and a second family. Even if she did think I'm a lot posher than I am.
</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> I don't need to tell you all how talented Alice B is, her work speaks for itself. What I will say though, is that in the somewhat short time I've been at RPS, Alice was one of the most genuine, funny people to work with. When freaking out over my first Game Club pick, Alice helped guide me through the process and provided invaluable feedback. Instead of giving my work a blind pass, she took the time to give me tailored, insightful suggestions to push my work further and out of my comfort zone. It's a real pity to see her go. I think I could have learnt so much more from her boundless experience in the field. Hopefully, we'll work together again at some point. Although, I'm positive someone very lucky will snap her up long before that. Good luck Alice.
</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Alice, I’ve been saying this a lot recently, in less printable language, but this is utter codswallop. Complete poppycock. A load of balderdash festooned with bunkum. I’m sorry that these circumstances preclude the send-off you deserve, which would likely involve barrelling out the doors on a golden chariot pulled by a dozen miniature horses, down an aisle of the finest scented candles and surrounded by confetti where every piece is a valid, obscenely profitable book deal.
</p>
<p>Still, the cool thing about being as enviably talented as Alice Goddamn Bell is that we all know you’ll end up doing something great. Probably several, all at once. For now, I’ll just say thank you for making the site what it is, for countless good times on the podcast, and for being a pal. RPS will endure, but only because we’ve all become a bit more Alice-like from working with you.
</p>
<p>Talk soon, yeah?
</p>
<p><strong>Brendan:</strong> The job of games journalist gets a few reactions. People recoil, or they say “cool”, or they have no idea what you mean. A select few, upon learning about this role, will deeply covet it. They will enlist in the career as if it is a war. When people tell Alice they want to be a games journalist because they love video games, she often gives them the following advice, the soundest, simplest counsel I have heard in our sickly trade: you may love to play games, trooper, but do you love to write?</p>
<p>Observe the truth of this. Anyone can play Assassin’s Creed, not everyone will feel compelled to write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-tour-of-regular-people-having-regular-jobs-in-assassins-creed-odyssey">a tour guide to its regular Grecian inhabitants</a>. Anybody can indulge in nostalgia by playing their favourite game from the early 2000s; few will be driven to write about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remember-how-great-ascii-art-used-to-be-in-game-guides">favourite online ASCII art</a> for those games. Anyone can play obscure indie experiments about the moon, not everyone will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ritual-of-the-moon">devote 28 days to said game with ritualistic rigour</a>. Alice does not simply love (some) video games, she is that person who loves to write. As if you needed more proof, she's only gone and written <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22779103.Alice_Bell">two bloody crime novels</a>. WHAT THE FUCK.</p>
<p>Her departure is a loss for RPS, but I suspect it will be a net gain for the world of writing. She is equally capable of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-could-have-shown-us-anything-with-starfield-and-they-chose-grey-rocks-again">a lethal takedown</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spiritfarer-review">swell of kindness</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-accidentally-gave-me-a-power-fantasy">all </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-will-video-games-give-me-their-sad-murder-mums">the insight</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">in-between</a>. From the shadowrealms of redundancy, Alice appeared to us in a goodbye call and asked everyone at RPS to “stay weird”. And, gotta say, it was hard to sit there and pretend like my eyes were not blurring out every face on the screen like a really shit episode of Traffic Cops.</p>
<p>I am being professionally sad here. But also personally. Only a few months ago, I was let go from an industry job (tl;dr – Embracer bullshit) and, by some grace or cunning, the very next day Alice Bell appeared in my inbox offering work, like a grizzled hand reaching up from a trench to pull a lost dog of war back down to the safety of boards and muck. Today, it stings that I have no power to return the favour. But if there’s one thing I know, as Alice winks at the camera and dashes off into the overworld of smoke and words, it’s that she actually doesn’t need my help to clear her way. Doesn’t need my cover fire, my always-alliterative artillery, nor rounds of rhetoric celebrating her ability. I don’t care. I’ll stand up and fire a full belt of this shit all the same. AHHHHH-HHHH-HHH-HH-H-h-h-h!</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> I first met Alice Bell when she did a summer internship for Official Xbox Magazine, where I was online editor till we all got laid off in 2014. I have one story I always tell about how she borrowed my Skyrim savegame for a feature, and proceeded to humiliate me in the office by complaining loudly that I’d barely done anything other than become Thane of Whiterun, then threw away all my carefully hoarded in-game books while I was away at a press event, for reasons I can’t recall. She also mocked me for listening to Keane, right in front of Edge. This kid will go far, I said to myself, through the tears.
</p>
<p>Alice B, you contain and create immensities. You will shrug off the arbitrary terms of your departure and out-videogames-journalism us all, assuming you don’t level up and disappear triumphantly into another sphere. You’re the kind of writer I think the games media needs but probably doesn’t deserve – somebody with an appetite and imagination for things beyond games which can then be called upon to think about games differently, and who can draw in younger writers who are similarly adventurous. You are also incredibly funny, and a supportive, compassionate editor who has signed off on some of the least expected and most rewarding freelance pieces I’ve read.
</p>
<p>There are many great writers in this space, but I think everybody struggles with the basic insularity of a form of journalism that is enthusiast by nature and which doesn’t allow the time for cultivating wider knowledge, because the games are so big, and the biggest of them want all the time we have. It’s a sappy cliché but genuinely, Alice, your work shines a light. Who else would write a whole column on Nancy Drew? Anyway, I’m about to overdo it so I’ll shut up now. I wish you the very best for the next thing. Whatever happens, we’ll always have Whiterun.</p>

        <p>Mobile publisher to support social media app in product strategy, user growth, and infrastructure</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Voodoo has acquired social media app BeReal for €500 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, BeReal sees users receive notifications to share photos of what they're doing within a two-minute window, which disappear after 24 hours.</p>
<p>Voodoo aims to provide support to BeReal in product strategy, user growth, and infrastructure, as well as investing in the company to help innovate new features.</p>
<p>Wizz CEO Aymeric Roffé will take over from BeReal's current CEO and founder Alexis Barreyat. Barreyat will remain involved in the short term, and will provide support in the integration of the two companies.</p>
<p>"BeReal achieved incredible user loyalty and growth," said Voodoo co-founder and CEO Alexandre Yazdi. "We are very excited to bring our teams together and leverage Voodoo's know-how and differentiated technologies to scale BeReal into a social network for authenticity."</p>
<p>Barreyat added: "Voodoo has a proven track record of driving significant growth in mobile apps. Their resources and expertise will help bring BeReal on a sustainable growth path."</p>

            <p>Mock reviews are a widespread practice within the games industry, yet due to the secretive nature of the work involved, they remain an under-discussed branch of the feedback process – particularly in comparison to fields such as QA and player testing. With most mock reviews and game evaluations written under heavy NDA, it's perhaps unsurprising that we hear little about this line of work.</p>
<p>With the help of experts in publishing, PR and game consultancy – combined with my own knowledge as a freelance consultant and mock reviewer – this article aims to demystify the mock review process, and explore how game evaluations provide a useful form of feedback at different stages of the development process.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">What is a mock review?</h2>
<p>In its most basic form, a mock review resembles the sort of review you would see published by games media. It's a written essay that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of a game, intended to mirror the external critique that a game would face at launch. Mock reviews are typically commissioned by publishers or marketing agencies, and often written by people with a background in games journalism.</p>
<p>"The idea is that publishers really want to gauge the potential success of their title and what a critical landscape will look like," says Sterling McGarvey, head of consulting at game consultancy firm Hit Detection. "Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews."</p>
<blockquote>"Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>Alongside a written article, clients will ask mock reviewers to provide a score, or an estimate of how the game would rank on Metacritic. McGarvey notes that publishers now increasingly value community sentiment as a way of gauging a game's success at launch, but as a forecasting metric, "Metacritic is easier and neater for all parties involved."</p>
<p>Depending on the project, reviewers could be required to give a general overview of their impressions of a game – as if they were publishing a real review – or be asked to focus their feedback on specific areas. This could be something such as a potential sensitivity issue, the game's narrative, or a particular set of mechanics.</p>
<p>"We pull together key messaging points when we're starting a campaign… and a lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across," says Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage. "If something we really want to lead on is gunplay mechanics, we will focus a lot more on 'How do you find the gunplay mechanics, and what kind of things would you recommend in terms of players creating their build-outs?'"</p>
<h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Mock reviews, game evaluations, and when they happen in development</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p>Although often used interchangeably, the terms 'mock review' and 'game evaluation' describe two slightly different forms of feedback. A mock review is typically a straightforward written review with a score.</p>
<p>"I have done only one pure mock review thus far in my career as a consultant," says PR consultant at Future Friends Games Natalie Flores, who has also conducted game evaluations for consultancy firms Magid and Hit Detection. "I've mostly done large reports spanning over 30 pages, amassed over the course of multiple surveys, roundtables, and many hours of writing; mock reviews have been a very small part of them."</p>
<p>These larger reports – in which mock reviews form only one section – are often termed evaluations. These can contain varying forms of feedback, such as breakout paragraphs or questionnaire results. The other key difference between mock reviews and game evaluations is when they take place during the development process.</p>
<p>"The term mock review is used as a blanket term," says McGarvey. "I look at a mock review as something that comes late in the development process, where perhaps there's not necessarily room to make changes, whereas a game evaluation can come at any stage of the development process. If [Hit Detection] were to evaluate a game, we can look at something as early as concept and provide some feedback just based on the collective expertise of the team. We look at what the landscape [might] look like a couple of years down the line and extrapolate.</p>
<blockquote>"A lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Other times, we will look at something that's just barely playable, alongside design documents and supporting materials… The idea being that we would look at the vision of the game, what we're playing, the scope of it, the development time they have remaining – and think 'If you're able to hit these elements of your vision, this is where we see you potentially landing with this'. It's just based on when the client feels it's appropriate, and they want to get some feedback on their game."</p>
<p>Though it may sound counterintuitive to commission a mock review close to release – when further changes cannot be made – these late-stage reviews still have their uses.</p>
<p>"There's two things that we're trying to do here: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from," says Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are. "Also, you can use them to manage client expectations."</p>
<p>So in essence, mock reviews provide a final heads-up on what critics will say about a game upon release – allowing for last-minute changes to marketing campaigns – and give publishers and PR agencies the opportunity to manage internal expectations of how a game will perform.</p>
<p>Mock reviews can be carried out internally: sometimes by a publisher's communications department, or even a dedicated in-house evaluations team. Yet alongside these internal reviews, publishers will often look to consultancies or freelance consultants to gain an outside perspective.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Not just for big publishers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Mock reviews and game evaluations can be commissioned by clients of all sizes. McGarvey says that while his work at Hit Detection used to be "heavily AAA," the consultancy has now evolved to "occupy a variety of niches," also including smaller budget AA titles ("your $30 games," he says) as well as indies.</p>
<blockquote>"There's two things that we're trying to do: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from"<cite>Lewis Denby</cite></blockquote>
<p>Denby says that for smaller teams, commissioning feedback is a matter of finding "the most valuable thing you can spend your limited budget on to help drive you towards success."</p>
<p>Commissioning a lengthy report might not be a sensible way to spend this budget, but asking evaluators to write about first impressions can be more helpful. This could involve giving the evaluators a trailer, media pack, screenshots, and asking them to play a 30-minute build.</p>
<p>"That can be so informative for indie developers, because a lot of the time these are things that they're so close to, they haven't realised that in the first five minutes of their game, there's a giant difficulty spike right off the bat," says Denby. "Or there might be something about the way they're talking about the game, or presenting the game, that's stopping people from even wanting to load up the demo in the first place. And that's often the biggest hurdle for small studios and solo devs – just getting that foot in the door."</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Why are mock reviews and game evaluations useful?</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, publishers typically commission mock reviews to gain an understanding of the critical reception a game will receive upon release, while evaluations highlight problem areas that can be addressed before launch. Developers can also become very close to their projects, sometimes making it difficult for them to impartially critique their own work. In these cases, mock reviews and evaluations are able to provide a more 'detached' form of feedback.</p>
<p>"It's very easy to not be able to see the wood from the trees, because you're in it every day," explains Denby. "We sometimes speak to indie developers who say 'We're really confident that we know how people respond to this game because we've taken it to shows and got feedback from people playing it.' And what I always say to that is… people don't want to be mean to your face. And actually, the feedback that's really valuable is that from people who you don't know, and have no vested interest whatsoever in your feelings."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Rebecca-Attard.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Evaluators can also provide guidance on how to present games to the media at launch. Attard explains that Splash Damage often equips mock reviewers with guides and documentation of the sort that would be given to critics upon release. Mock reviewers can give feedback on these guides, identifying places where journalists and influencers could potentially become confused.</p>
<p>"I've also used mock reviewers early in the cycle when we're doing things like events, or a big press beat, to look at the demo we're putting out and look at the presentation around it to ensure that the way we're talking about this game – based on what they're playing, and what we're saying – is really clear," Attard adds.</p>
<p>Developers are often aware of the problem areas within their own games, but may need further evidence to back up any proposed changes. For this reason, game evaluations can be useful for internal politicking.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, a developer will ask for something from the higher-ups and be unable to get that thing – say, for example, budget for a particular feature or segment that they know will improve the game," says Flores. "A developer can consult outside experts like mock reviewers to see if the experts will agree with them… The developer can then take the expert evaluation to the higher-up, as they will now have a stronger argument they can present when asking for what they need."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The difference in feedback compared to QA and playtests</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Developers receive feedback on their games from a variety of sources: QA, consumer playtests, and influencer playtests being just some examples. All of these forms of feedback are valuable, and in addition to these, game evaluators can bring a different perspective to the table.</p>
<p>"When you want to bring in game evaluators, you're looking for a perspective that understands media, that understands consumers and community to some degree," McGarvey explains. "It's on-the-job training that you bring, there's a certain degree of intangibles from your experience reviewing games."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Lewis-Denby_LZzdmkX.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared to QA testers – who do invaluable work highlighting specific bugs and technical problems – the job of a mock reviewer is more about critical analysis.</p>
<p>"What we're really trying to understand from a mock review is – what is going to be the reaction of the media when they play this?" Denby says. "What sort of emotions or thoughts or feelings does it conjure up? What sort of likelihood of coverage is there? All these sorts of things can be really relevant."</p>
<p>Attard notes that mock reviewers will often look at games in a more "impartial" way than consumers do in playtests.</p>
<p>"Users tend to get hooked up on little niggles that they might not necessarily like. Whereas a mock reviewer can give us a much broader view of everything, and in a much more considered way, written up into a report that isn't just raw feedback."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The importance of using a wide range of reviewers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>In most cases, publishers will commission mock reviews from several critics at once. There can also be several rounds of mock reviews or evaluations on a single project, taking place at different stages of the development process.</p>
<blockquote>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is to gather a broad range of perspectives. Attard gives the example of a strategy game: for this, she would likely bring in an experienced strategy gamer, alongside a reviewer who's more of a generalist, in order to gain two different perspectives on the game. She adds that Splash Damage typically brings in both English language speakers and non-English language speakers, as this gives an understanding of different markets.</p>
<p>"We tend to do at least four different mock reviews from different markets and different individual journalists, because it is so important to not just focus on one."</p>
<p>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well," she adds. "It's also a generational thing – there's certain things that the older generation might look for that the younger generation don't, and that gives you a fresh take on it with the younger generation."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">How do I become a mock reviewer or game evaluator?</h2>
<p>Most mock reviewers have a background in games journalism, and transition to evaluation work once they have significant experience writing reviews. The first step towards becoming a game evaluator, therefore, is to build up a portfolio of work that shows you can critically analyse a game and clearly explain your thoughts.</p>
<p>"I would recommend honing your criticism skills," says Flores. "Write your thoughts down after you finish a game, make a coherent argument about your perspective. Know how to relay this verbally, too – you'll be doing plenty of talking and responding to questions from the developer with the more involved mock review assignments out there."</p>
<blockquote>"Networking is, at its best, genuine relationship building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on"<cite>Natalie Flores</cite></blockquote>
<p>Writing reviews for your own blog is a useful way to refine your skills and demonstrate an interest in games journalism but, as Denby notes, you will likely need experience writing for professional outlets before you can take on mock review work.</p>
<p>"We need to see that you have gone through that process – working under an editor, having professionally published content – because we need to understand that you have created content of the sort that we want to understand."</p>
<p>Alongside gaining experience as a professional reviewer, it's useful to build up your knowledge of the game development process. It's important that you are able to look past bugs to understand the developer's vision. Equally, when evaluating a game later in the development process, your suggestions need to be realistic for the project's remaining development timeframe.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Be a generalist, but have a speciality</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Although it sounds paradoxical, being a mock reviewer requires both a general understanding of the gaming landscape, and the ability to specialise. A broad knowledge of gaming news, industry trends, and community sentiment is useful when giving feedback to clients, allowing you to highlight potential marketing opportunities or risks. Being a generalist also allows you to work on a wide range of projects. Yet it's also helpful to be known as an expert in a couple of areas. Evaluating a game in a genre you know well will allow you to make comparisons to similar games in the market, providing clients with useful context.</p>

<p>If there is a specific game design element that you are particularly good at analysing – such as UI/UX design or onboarding – you can also make this your niche. Publishers may seek you out if you are known to be an expert in a specific genre, or if you can provide useful insights into a particular aspect of a game's design.</p>
<p>"If you've got a niche that's outside of the usual 'this game is good or bad,' take that and make it your superpower," advises McGarvey.</p>
<p>Some evaluators specialise in identifying best practices in areas such as accessibility, or diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>"Accessibility is an area where there's a lot of people doing great advocacy and consultancy work," adds McGarvey. "The work that those organisations are doing helps everybody as a whole… A rising tide raises all ships, and these advancements, in my opinion, are making games better."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Promote yourself, and get networking</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Attracting mock review work is also a matter of making yourself visible, and building a reputation for producing high-quality reviews. As a journalist, you may well have a platform on social media, so it's worth leveraging this to display your work. A portfolio website allows publishers to check your past reviews, and see if you would be a good match for their project.</p>
<blockquote>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>PR firms and consulting agencies often do outreach to reviewers to ask for their help with mock reviews. Equally, you can be proactive by emailing PR agencies, and letting them know that you're available for work. Over time, opportunities may come your way through word-of-mouth recommendations, and through networking.</p>
<p>"Networking is, at its best, just genuine relationship-building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on," says Flores. "Just be polite and kind; have some convictions and don't be afraid to voice them constructively on social media… and become someone known for being reliable and doing good work."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>What makes a good mock reviewer or evaluator?</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, a good evaluator is able to look at an early game build and give useful feedback without being distracted by bugs which are likely to be fixed during the development process. Giving feedback on a game's flow or difficulty curve will be useful for developers; spending three paragraphs describing a bug is unlikely to be helpful.</p>
<p>An ability to detach yourself from your personal tastes and present a wider view of the critical landscape can also be beneficial. McGarvey describes this as the ability to externalise.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component," he adds.</p>
<p>Denby mentions that it's helpful when evaluators simply write a review as they would for a publication, rather than trying to pre-empt what the developers might be looking for: "Just review it, imagine that this is what you were putting out there into the world, because that is ultimately what we're trying to gauge when we distribute this code – what's likely to happen."</p>
<p>Finally, for Attard, one of the most important qualities an evaluator can have is the ability to communicate effectively and forge positive working relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>"Some [evaluators] come back with things that aren't necessarily that positive, and [publishers] have to be able to accept what they're saying and not get frustrated or annoyed at them," Attard says. "That's where having a good relationship – where someone is able to really communicate with you about the process, or the reasons why they're saying these things – is key."</p>

<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At the time of writing, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>‘s long awaited DLC expansion, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em>, will be launching in just over a week on June 21. In case you weren’t aware, though, you can’t jump straight into it unless you’ve at least managed to defeat two of the base game’s optional boss fights; a feat a significant number of players still haven’t done.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">During a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202402/22335199.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Famitsu</a> this past February, <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that, in order to access the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and its new area, the Realm of Shadow, you need to have already killed Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. Sounds simple enough, but everyone knows that <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s boss fights are anything but simple or easy to beat. What’s more, you could very easily miss Mohg during your own playthrough, so be sure to read our guide on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-in-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find and beat Mohg</a> in case you haven’t done so already.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Don’t feel bad if you haven’t; a lot of other <em>Elden Ring</em> players still haven’t beaten Mohg either. On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch streamer Cohh Carnage</a> revealed that, on Steam, only 37.8% of players had acquired the Shardbearer Mohg achievement you get for killing Mohg. This prompted publisher Bandai Namco to <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet out a warning/reminder</a> on June 11 and, since then, the number’s only gone up to 38.7% according to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1245620/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam stats</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Things look a bit better on PlayStation and Xbox. According to tracking sites <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Elden-Ring/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a354491/shardbearer-mohg-achievement">TrueAchievements</a>, 65% of PlayStation players and 54% of Xbox players have claimed the Shardbearer Mohg trophy/achievement, but this still leaves a lot of players that won’t be able to play the DLC. Looking at the stats, there are also plenty of people that haven’t even defeated Radahn yet. At the time of writing, 54.5% of Steam players, 77% of PlayStation players, and 70% of Xbox players have received the Shardbearer Radahn achievement for beating him.</p>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="false">It’s likely that a portion of those players simply dropped off <em>Elden Ring</em> sometime after buying it, and may have no intention of returning to the game. Fortunately, for those who do want to play the DLC and haven’t got round to defeating Radahn and/or Mohg, the <em>Elden Ring</em> community is full of people willing to share advice. Plus, the game has a summon mechanic that lets you call on other players for aid during fights, so be sure to take advantage of that.</p>
