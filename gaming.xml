<p>Apple Arcade, the mobile gaming subscription service, is reportedly one of several Apple services suffering from low usage and profits. It’s been reported in the past that payouts to developers have been declining for years, and if it weren’t included in the Apple One bundle, it would be considered unprofitable.</p>



<h2 id="h-25-of-apple-arcade-users-during-it-first-years-were-on-free-trials">25% of Apple Arcade Users During it First Years Were on Free Trials</h2>



<p>The information comes, ironically, from tech and business news outlet The Information, who <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Apple is losing over $1 billion a year on its streaming service, Apple TV+. The report also mentions other Apple services that are supposedly not performing well, including Apple Arcade.</p>



<p>“Apple Arcade, for example, had only 2 million users in its first year after it launched in 2019, with roughly 25% of them on free trials, according to one person with direct knowledge of the figures,” reads The Information’s report. “Without Apple One, some services, such as Apple Arcade and Fitness+, likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple One is a subscription bundle introduced in 2020 that offers access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud storage, with a Premier plan option that includes Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ as well.</p>



<p>Apple Arcade was launched only a year prior in 2019, offering direct access to paid games without advertisements or in-app purchases. 71 games were included at launch, and developers like Capcom, Sega, Bandai Namco, and Devolver Digital partnered with Apple to create games for the service. But <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Neil Long at Mobilegamer.biz from last year claimed that payouts to developers had been declining for year, and that a “shitload” of projects had been canceled. One developer reportedly told Long that the Apple Arcade service had “the smell of death” around it. Still, Apple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-trials-of-mana-and-more-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added 10 new games to the service just this past January</a>.</p>



<p>Are Apple Arcade’s days numbered? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The lengthy Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop will contain nine special drops for fans of the game to pick up, with a special promo card for those that go all in.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation Superdrop Announcement</h2>

<p>In the official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-superdrop" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, Wizards of the Coast outlines the cards in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop. As the name implies, the cards in this superdrop are chaotic and sporadic. As if the person in charge wasn't around to approve them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-spongebob-meme-cards.jpg?itok=AwPuvRi2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-spongebob-meme-cards.jpg?itok=0buJQmb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first three drops in the superdrop are the previously announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spongebob Squarepants Secret Lairs</a>. Want to wield Mr. Krabs or Sandy Cheeks as Legendary Creatures or just cast meme-art versions of Counterspell and Force of Despair? These are the cards to pick up.</p>

The <em>They Grow Up So Fast</em> drop showcases five different dragonlord cards. Each card is reversible. One side shows the dragon as a recently hatched wyrmling. the other shows them fully matured. This drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Dragonlord Atarka</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Dromoka</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Kologhan</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Ojutai</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Silumgar</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-garden-buds-card-artwork.jpg?itok=olZliX4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-garden-buds-card-artwork.jpg?itok=E8KJPcgo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those with an eye for nature, the fifth drop is for you. The <em>Garden Buds</em> drop showcases nature or forest-dwelling cards in a trippy artstyle courtesy of Jordan Crane. The cards featured in this drop are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ashaya, Soul of the Wind</em></li>
	<li><em>Elvish Reclaimer</em></li>
	<li><em>Harrow</em></li>
	<li><em>World Shaper</em></li>
	<li><em>Horn of Greed</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-tragic-romance-artwork.jpg?itok=Oh6dpFgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-tragic-romance-artwork.jpg?itok=-yv75yRj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Drop six is for those that have indulged in a bit of fantasy romance. Aptly named <em>Tragic Romance</em>, this drop contains four cards with artwork straight out of a harlequin romance novel showcasing art by Abigail Larson. Those four cards are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon</em></li>
	<li><em>Kaalia of the Vast</em></li>
	<li><em>Angel of Despair</em></li>
	<li><em>Master of Cruelties</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-twisted-toons-cards.jpg?itok=KxfwWXC4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-twisted-toons-cards.jpg?itok=MbsPPp4y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a complete pivot in tone is the seventh drop. The <em>Twisted Toons</em> drop sports an early 20th century cartoon look straight out of Fleisher Studios. If you like old-school Disney, or played a lot of Cuphead, these cards may catch your eye. Those cards are.</p>

<ul><li><em>Silence</em></li>
	<li><em>Winds of Abandon</em></li>
	<li><em>Culling of the Weak</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Push</em></li>
	<li><em>Young Wolf</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-pick-em-and-stick-em-artwork.jpg?itok=FYlJGkfx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-pick-em-and-stick-em-artwork.jpg?itok=nRujkfKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The eighth drop in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop is yet another switch in tone. The <em>Pick 'Em and Stick 'Em</em> drop is a candy coated dose of bright, colorful fluff. It even has sheets of stickers to customize those cards further. The drop contains the following:</p>

<ul><li><em>Thalia, Heretic Cathar</em></li>
	<li><em>Clever Impersonator</em></li>
	<li><em>Hedron Crab</em></li>
	<li><em>Pitiless Plunderer</em></li>
	<li>Treasure Token</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-class-of-87-artwork.jpg?itok=yjCvLUQE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-class-of-87-artwork.jpg?itok=-edc-THw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Last but not least is the S<em>ecret Lair: Class of '87</em> drop. As the name implies, this drop reimagines several cards as high school yearbook photos. The artwork by Stephen Andrade and Scott Okumura even goes that extra mile with era-specific stylized text. The cards in this drop are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait</em></li>
	<li><em>Anje Falkenrath</em></li>
	<li><em>Chulane, Teller of Tales</em></li>
	<li><em>Radha, Heart of Keld</em></li>
</ul><p>All nine drops in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop is available in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). In addition, if you spend more than $150 on a single order, you will receive a rainbow foil Deadeye Navigator promo card at no additional charge. The superdrop will be available March 24.</p>

At the time I blamed it on technical limitations and a focus on zombie-filled wastelands, and the lack of good dinosaur games made me really sad. So I’m happy to report that in 2025 we have a bunch of new dinosaur games to get excited about, and not all of them are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947"><em>Jurassic Park</em>-related</a></span>. </p><p>Just yesterday,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551"> during the Spring Future Games Show</a></span>, another new dinosaur game was announced: <em>Deathground</em>, a co-op survival horror game featuring dangerous dinos. And it’s just one of many upcoming games that look to be trying to fill the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w">creepy, <em>Dino Crisis</em>-shaped void</a></span> that currently exists because Capcom won’t remake or develop a new entry in the franchise. </p><p>So let’s take a look at some of the potentially awesome dinosaur games coming to a video game console or PC near you. (Oh and spoilers, but none of the games listed in here have release dates, so who knows how long we’ll have to wait to play them.)</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">Announced back in 2023</a></span>, <em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person survival horror game being developed by Saber Interactive. Since its announcement we’ve not heard or seen much else about the project, but we know it’s still in the works. Let’s hope this game is better than <em>Trespasser</em>.</p></div><div><p>Set to be published by Annapurna Interactive, <em>The Lost Wild</em> is also a first-person survival horror game set on a jungle-covered island filled with hungry dinosaurs and abandoned science facilities. The trailers we’ve seen for this upcoming dino game look amazing, and if it plays as well as it looks we might be in for a terrifying treat.</p></div><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this before. <em> Compound Fracture</em> is a spooky first-person game featuring dinosaurs and dilapidated facilities where questionable science took place. However, unlike the other games on this list, <em>Compound Fracture</em> is designed to look and play more like a 1990s game, complete with some lovely looking low res textures. I’m very excited to see more of this indie game in the future.</p></div><div><p>This is the most recently announced game on our list and while it has some similarities to  the other dinosaur games we’ve looked at, including its FPS perspective and focus on horror, <em>Deathground </em>will support online co-op. Also, the dinosaurs in this upcoming survival horror multiplayer game have feathers. I’ll let you decide how you feel about that.</p></div><div><p>While many of the games on this list are directly inspired by <em>Jurassic Park </em>and its lush tropical jungles, <em>Paleophage </em>is clearly riffing on recent <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes with its more urban setting and third-person camera. That sounds great to me! If this game is half as good as the recent <em>RE4 </em>remake and also has dinosaurs in it, I’ll be perfectly satisfied.</p></div><div><p>Not every upcoming dinosaur game is a survival horror adventure. Take <em>Turok Origins</em>, which was announced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969">December 2024</a></span> and looks to be a co-op third-person shooter set in the strange prehistoric alien universe of <em>Turok</em>. It’s being developed by the company behind S<em>pace Marine 2.</em></p></div><div><p>Published by TinyBuild, <em>Ferocious </em>is described by its devs as an old-school, action-packed FPS set on a tropical island inhabited by dangerous mercs and even more dangerous dinos. Simple premise, but the game basically looks like <em>Far Cry </em>+ dinosaurs and that’s a formula that has me excited to play. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The innie and outie of Mark Scout (Adam Scott) communicate by camcorder, walking in and out of a severed cabin to discuss a game plan to get Gemma (Dichen Lachman), Outie Mark’s wife, out from the depths of Lumon’s testing floor before the corporation puts her out to pasture. Innie Mark realizes that if he goes along with the plan to save Gemma and expose Lumon for kidnapping her, it will likely sink the company and lead to the dissolution of the severed floor, leading to the “deaths” of every innie on the floor.</p><p>Outie Mark believes that the people working on the severed floor are going through a “nightmare” that is nothing more than torture. But Innie Mark doesn’t view it that way. Sure, he knows Lumon should be stopped, but he envisions a life with Helly (Britt Lower), even if it’s only eight hours long most days. It’s only half a life, but it’s one he would rather fight for than give up for a woman he doesn’t even know. The recorded back and forth between both Marks goes south, and then Cobel (Patricia Arquette) tells Innie Mark plainly that there is no honeymoon ending for him and Helly. Mark’s reintegration may allow his innie’s memories to live on, but there’s no version of events in which he and Helly get to live out the lives they’ve been dreaming of. At least, that’s what everyone is telling him.</p><p><em>Severance </em>has spent much of its second season exploring just how different innies and outies are from one another. Are certain parts of us innate, even without all the memories and trauma that shape us? Was her familiarity why Mark couldn’t tell that Helly’s outie was spying on them for half the season? Could the undeniable parallels carried between innies and outies be why Dylan (Zach Cherry) was drawn to his wife both in and out of the severed floor? For Helly, the question of whether or not certain parts of us are innate is fatalistic. She has tried to differentiate her innie self from her cutthroat corporate heiress outie, just for her father (Michael Siberry) to tell her that he sees more of the fire of her ancestor and Lumon founder Kier Eagan in the severed version of her than he ever did the daughter he raised. Conversely, Dylan finds hope in his innie’s reassured confidence because maybe it means that spirit is in him too, deep down. Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) may have had no recollection of their workplace love affair but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ep-9-season-2-burt-irving-relationship-gay-1851770084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ep-9-season-2-burt-irving-relationship-gay-1851770084">were still drawn to each other on the surface</a></span>.</p><p>That’s the introspective angle, but <em>Severance </em>is also clear about how these bisected personalities are two different entities and only one gets any say in either of their lives, like an overbearing parent to their offspring. During the recorded conversation between the Marks, the outie starts to call the gradually more defiant innie a “child,” as if wanting to have his own life, one that’s no longer dictated by someone who only cared to know anything about him when he needed something, was the equivalent of an unruly kid throwing a tantrum. Mark and his inner circle may be the “good guys,” but they’re not that different from Helly’s outie who, in season one, also condescended to her innie like a controlling parent. Lower’s delivery of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc8hut6vMG0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc8hut6vMG0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I am a person. You are not</a></span>” rang in my head as Mark tried to tell his innie that he should give his life for Gemma so his outie could have a happy ending. Innies were always tools to be forgotten by even the most well-meaning Lumon employee, and though Mark tries to reason with his other half, the mask falls off as his frustration gives way to dehumanization. Eventually, the bittersweet fatalism wins out and the innie agrees to save his outie’s wife.</p><p>Gemma’s jailbreak requires the cooperation of both versions of Mark as they move between floors, and “Cold Harbor” does a stellar job of illustrating the disorienting disconnect of swapping between severed personalities in rapid succession. Outie Mark wakes up with a gun in his hand and accidentally kills a man in an elevator. Innie Mark gets control back minutes later in a blood-soaked liplock with Gemma in the same elevator. Between the swaps, the show, which normally avoids explicit physical violence in favor of the psychological kind, here sees that restraint give way at last as the worst of Lumon’s goons finally facing a workplace uprising they’ve long deserved. But at the operation’s core is a conflicted Innie Mark who wants to live, has been told there’s no version of this where he and Helly get to run off into the sunset, and thinks the only way he can do anything with his final hours is to save Gemma and take down the company that “killed” Irving’s innie and so many others.</p><p>So how do you end a season that has spent the past 10 episodes wondering if a person with divided memories can ever see eye to eye with someone who essentially birthed them into a workplace they can never leave? There is no real compromise between both Marks, as the innie will lose the only life he’s ever known if he helps his outie bring his wife home. You do it with a final five minutes that leaves audiences devastated, and me quietly wishing the show could end on this stunning note. Mark’s innie gets Gemma to the exit and she’s finally able to escape. But when she turns around, her husband’s other half is hesitating at the door. If he walks through, he will hand the keys over to his outie and he doesn’t know if he can trust his outie to reintegrate. Even if he did, would this shared life even come close to resembling the one he wants? Then, Helly approaches from behind and calls his name.</p><figure id="" data-id="a38a286c441fced630a0931ecd97066a" data-recommend-id="image://a38a286c441fced630a0931ecd97066a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2843" data-height="1600" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helly and Mark run down a hallway." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Helly and Mark run down a hallway." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a38a286c441fced630a0931ecd97066a" data-recommend-id="image://a38a286c441fced630a0931ecd97066a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2843" data-height="1600" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helly and Mark run down a hallway." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a connoisseur of choice-based games, I could almost see the <em>Life Is Strange </em>decision UI on the screen as Mark thought about what to do next. Does he leave with his outie’s wife, who is crying and begging him to open the door and walk through, or does he choose his own happiness somewhere on this hellish severed floor? Gemma’s cries are harrowing; she’s finally reunited with her husband just to watch him walk away, holding hands with someone else. My god, what a note to end on.</p><p>Rebellion has been at the center of every episode of <em>Severance</em> this season. Throughout the Apple TV series, Lumon has treated asking questions, breaking rules, and defying orders as an immature endeavor against the inevitable. The corporation and its founder have an infinite wisdom that no worker should ever doubt. Innies are immature and bull-headed and are getting in the way of what their outies demand of them. This is the same condescension many misguided parents force upon a teenager who is breaking from the mold they were supposed to fill. We’re often taught that teenage rebellion is a phase one grows out of and regrets as they get older, but in truth a person, no matter how young, advocating for themselves and their ability to choose is just a basic human reaction to being told who and what you’re supposed to be. Innies have only ever been told they’re like tools, meant to live and die for the cause of the workplace, and are merely an extension of the “real” person who can discard them at any moment. Mark denying his outie’s wishes and deciding to run hand-in-hand with Helly to the deepest parts of the Lumon maze in hopes that they could spend even just a few more minutes together is the only conclusion this story could have possibly reached. All the slow burn was worth it. I know <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552">there’s going to be a third season</a></span>, but god, it would have been incredible if this had been the end.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Netflix was working on a AAA multiplayer shooter with a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">the game and the studio were scuttled</a> in 2024. Why? One of Netflix's top gaming bosses, Alain Tascan, said in an interview that this project did not align with the company's goals.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-21/netflix-bets-big-on-video-games-with-broad-new-strategy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tascan told Bloomberg</a>. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p><p>The shift away from this game came amid a wider shakeup at at Netflix's film and TV divisions that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-kind-of-movies-netflix-wants-to-focus-on-going-forward/1100-6522677/" data-ref-id="1100-6522677">calls for fewer, less-expensive releases that aim for higher quality.</a> </p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>Just this week, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spry Fox announced Spirit Crossing for Netflix</a>, while Shenmue designer Yu Suzuki's new game <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/steel-paws-mobile-game-news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steel Paws</a> was released in February. </p>

From Renaissance Italy to Ancient Greece, Ubisoft's open world series has explored a wonderful variety of locations and settings, ensuring each conspiracy-packed game is a (semi) educational window into the past. Such an approach has made the series unique among its genre stablemates, which tend to whisk us away to fantasy lands or sprawling modern-day metropolises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the bones of Assassin's Creed have mostly remained the same across its 14 mainline entries, the series has undergone a lot of changes over the years, including new takes on player progression and ever-expanding worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which Assassin's Creed games are the best of the bunch? It's a tough question. After much deliberation (and only a handful of arguments), though, we’ve eventually agreed on the top 10 mainline entries in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, without further ado, here are our top 10 Assassin’s Creed games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Assassin's Creed Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Playing the latest game in the series? Check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows guide</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2011/06/06/assassins-creed-revelations-20110606095314825-3464823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</a> wrapped up Altair Ibn-La-Ahad and Ezio Auditore’s stories, and, despite some unremarkable additions like the Den Defense mode, it was a memorable and thrilling send off. From flying down ziplines in Constantinople to hanging out with Leonardo Da Vinci, Revelations was packed full of fascinating adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ezio and Altair’s final chapter was, in a way, both a sign of things to come and a celebration of what came before. Not only did we get one final fling with these two after seeing them grow and learn from lives full of adventure, but we had a chance to say goodbye to the first era of Assassin’s Creed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Assassin's Creed Syndicate</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/24/acssc63previewsasylumzipline1443101428jpg-9b2cc6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed games are often as defined by their locations as they are their protagonists, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>’s 19th Century Victorian London in the throes of industrialization may be the most memorable of the bunch. Sneaking around factories, racing horse-drawn carriages down the street, and even fighting Jack the Ripper all ground Syndicate in a setting that, while still fantastical, feels real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to this sense of place is the string-heavy score from Journey composer Austin Wintory that doesn’t sound like anything else in the series before or after: dueling protagonists Jacob and Evie Fry even have their own soundtracks. It’s a small touch, but it’s one in a string of small touches that makes Syndicate’s world cohesive. Also, it’s hard to recall any game this side of Bloodborne that lets you fight this effectively with a cane.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/01/assassinscreedvalhallafinalcontent-blog-1669914922538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> didn’t reinvent the wheel like Origins did, but it did make some pretty substantial changes. Combat is weightier and more impactful than ever before; traditional side quests have been replaced by world events, making exploration and discovery much more organic; and the absurd amount of loot you’d have to organize and sift through was toned down substantially, making rewards feel much more valuable on the whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eivor might not be our favorite of the Assassin’s Creed protagonists, but her (or his) story is an engaging one, and is one of the best blendings of historical fantasy and mythology that the series has ever seen. Fans of Norse mythology are treated with a feast; not only do the sagas play a major role within the main campaign, but an entire game-length expansion set in the world of Thor and Odin practically turns Valhalla into a cousin of God of War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-c79ca0fa59bedea20c24e2ac0c2735e7ce2f3ae6-1920x1080-1739442669756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood">Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</a> continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, cementing him as a fan-favorite protagonist for the series. It trades the diverse locations of Assassin’s Creed 2 for an expanded version of Rome and its surrounding countryside and builds on the new mechanics introduced in Assassins Creed 2 – swimming, property management, firearms, and recruitable allies. This chapter of Ezio’s story is filled with charm, wit, and drama, and, thanks to its updated combat, we got to be the aggressive combat assassin we all wanted to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer, allowing players to step into the shoes of the Templars to see who among their friends truly was the best assassin or hunter. It may not have advanced the formula as much as its predecessor, but it’s still cherished by many as one of the very best. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Assassin's Creed Origins</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-1a0ab42e93e51c48ad9a6bda7f408958e09a43b0-1920x1080-1739443042212.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins marked a turning point in the series. It was the game that turned Assassin’s Creed from a stealth-focused action-adventure, into a straight-up open world RPG with a size and scope rivaled only by very few games. But even setting the historical significance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> aside, it’s important to note that it’s also just a damn good Assassin’s Creed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its central story involving Bayek and Aya, who initially set out to find justice for their murdered son and ultimately wind up founding the order that would eventually become the Assassin’s Brotherhood, is extremely compelling; the world of ancient Egypt is a marvel to explore; and while many facets of its mechanics were improved in later games, the shift to loot-based progression and a more action <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPG</a> style of combat was just the kind of shot in the arm that the series needed to reinvigorate it in the eyes of fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Assassin's Creed Unity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/06/09/acuscreencombatsworde31406094pmpst1402143761jpg-b685a9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the tipsy sway of Black Flag’s pirate protagonist Edward Kenway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin’s Creed Unity</a> was a return to the tone of original Assassin’s Creed. As the first AC game to be exclusively released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (alongside PC of course), Assassin’s Creed Unity was a graphical powerhouse for its time, boasting enormous crowds of NPCs walking through the streets of a near 1:1 accurate recreation of Paris. Even today, it’s still remarkably handsome to look at.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Unity’s launch was a bit of a bumpy ride. A cavalcade of bugs, glitches, and an intensely overburdened map meant it was quickly written off by many. However, in the years since it has (thanks to several patches) blossomed into a firm favourite among Assassin’s Creed fans. Its enhanced movement system resulted in arguably the most fluid and elegant parkour the series has ever seen, which in turn allowed for excellent hit-and-run tactics. Its main assassination missions are also a series highpoint, offering a multitude of ways to infiltrate locations and bury your blade deep in a target’s neck. And frankly, seeing Notre Dame in all its glory makes AC Unity well worth the price of admission.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/acs-1742375176700.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Feudal Japan is the most-requested setting for an Assassin’s Creed game of all time, and so Ubisoft faced towering expectations when it finally decided to visit the Sengoku period. Thankfully, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was exactly what the series needed; it brings the focus back to assassinations, putting increased emphasis on stealth and infiltration. And while still expansive, the open world and RPG elements are more restrained than those in Odyssey and Valhalla, resulting in a tighter, more balanced experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time since Syndicate, Shadows features two playable protagonists. Naoe’s toolkit is rooted in stealth, while Yasuke is a brutal fighter who captures the period’s samurai fantasy. While Shadows is best experienced from a mix of both perspectives, taking control of Naoe and making use of her grappling hook and climbing abilities allows you the full freedom to explore what is undoubtedly the series’ most astonishing world, complete with landscapes that dynamically change with the shifting of the seasons. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-16fc551879ac299dca68839da90f89d9e624db48-1920x1080-1739442948351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassins’ Creed Odyssey</a> takes Origins’ combat style and new-found focus on role-playing, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece, aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series; both at land and sea (naval warfare returns here, and it’s wonderful). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that are the most tense in any Assassin’s Creed to date, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large scale battles in the name of Athens or Sparta. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests, fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist - whether you play as a male or female. Even after you finish Odyssey, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Assassin's Creed 2</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-d3967a58038cc5e59332bb0043ab1ca343112bc6-1920x1080-1739442866992.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> to thank for not only proving the formula works but for also giving us the defining analogy of a video game sequel fulfilling the promise of its underwhelming original. Though later entries would add even more depth, ACII made assassination missions more dynamic, with increased flexibility in how you approached objectives, more options for hiding or causing distractions, better combat, and better mobility with the ability to actually swim. New catacomb missions let players put their parkour skills to the test, the upgradeable homebase villa gave players a reason to keep investing in picking up collectibles and coins, and new weapons and gear from everyone’s favorite video game character, Leonardo da Vinci, kept gameplay fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these changes were also connected to a beautifully realized Italian Renaissance era that introduced an all-time protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and meaningful additions to the current-day story that brought the two time periods together in the wildest way possible. I mean, you fistfight the pope only to have an otherworldly deity speak through Ezio to Desmond in the present day. It was an unforgettable ending to an entry that proved how incredible Assassin’s Creed could be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/10/ac4bfdlc12500x1400jpg-885d49.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long run of assassin protagonists, Black Flag tried something different, introducing us to a main character who was a pirate first, and an assassin second - and the ensuing adventure thrived because of it. It introduced a massively entertaining sandbox playground in the Caribbean, featuring a plethora of islands teeming with treasure and activities to embark upon - and an upgrade system that made the idea of hunting wild animals and harpooning something other than a chore. Instead of relegating the idea of sailing as means to an end, it built upon the framework of Assassin’s Creed 3’s naval combat to make nautical adventures the shining point of Black Flag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was hunting hapless merchant ships or bracing against some of the toughest buccaneers ever to sail the seas, attacking other ships cemented itself as something too good to pass up any time one floated by on screen. Aided by its impressive seamless transition from land to sea, it allowed the freedom of choice for players to either sail circles around enemy ships while blasting them to pieces, or ramming head on to leap onto the enemy ship, before unloading a brace of pistols like a whirling dervish. Not only did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> cement itself as one of the greatest in the series, it has easily become one of the greatest pirate games to immerse yourself in as well.</p><div id="every-assassins-creed-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>You may also like: The </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-like-assassins-creed"><em>Best Games Like Assassin's Creed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it!

                <p>One of Valve's most popular games, 1998's Half-Life, could have been the one and only game the company ever released, until a deal was struck that changed the company's fate forever. Monica Harrington, Valve's first chief marketing officer, said at the Game Developers Conference that publisher Sierra had the option for two more games, and after the first Half-Life became a gigantic success, Valve attempted to renegotiate with Sierra.</p><p>The terms of the deal, Harrington said, was that Valve would fund all but $1 million of the development costs of Half-Life's sequels, with Sierra retaining IP rights and giving Valve back 15% of revenue. "It felt insane," Harrington said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/valve-would-never-ship-another-game-former-exec-forced-half-life-publishers-hand-by-saying-gabe-newell-and-the-team-would-pivot-away-from-game-dev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Harrington said that if she and her husband Mike Harrington were to make real money out of being co-owners of Valve at the time, she knew Valve's prospects had to be "much, much brighter," and that included renegotiating with Sierra.</p><p>After getting the OK from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell, Harrington worked with Valve's attorney to hammer out a strategy for getting Half-Life's IP rights back, for the original Half-Life and all future titles. But how?</p><p>Harrington said she pushed for Valve and Sierra to strike a deal with the threat that Valve would abandon making games altogether if Sierra didn't come to the table. "Valve would never ship another game," Harrington recalled of the bargaining tactic.</p><p>"It wasn't an idle threat--we weren't going to take on all of the risk to make other people rich," Harrington said. "Besides, I knew Gabe had interesting ideas that had nothing to do with games."</p><p>One of those ideas was for Valve to create an <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"online entertainment platform" with Amazon</a>, but this fell through. In the end, Valve won back control of the Half-Life series from Sierra. Valve went to release Half-Life 2 in 2004 and later the VR title Half-Life: Alyx in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">that game won GameSpot's Game of the Year</a>. Valve's massively popular Counter-Strike series also traces its roots back to Half-Life, originating as a mod for that game.</p><p>Valve is much more than a game developer today, as it owns and operates the massively popular PC game store Steam. Companies have attempted to buy Valve over the years, but the company remains independent. Newell, for his part, has become a billionaire and now <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">owns a half-dozen yachts that are valued at over $1 billion.</a></p><p>One criticism of Valve today is that the company no longer releases many games, instead focusing more on Steam and hardware with its Steam Deck. It does have more games in the works, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">including a 6v6 MOBA called Deadlock.</a> There is still no word on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-3/">Half-Life 3</a>, however.</p>

"Cities were being built around castles, the samurai went from being guardians protecting [rural property] to becoming now centered around the city, and it also led to urbanization—like commerce changed quite a bit because there was such a demand at war, and so the merchants at that time became very rich, and they climbed the social ladder.

What this inherently racist criticism from these communities fails to consider is that Yasuke's place during this time period makes a compelling case for him as a protagonist and puts him very much in line with Assassin's Creed's focus on the strange, secret history of humanity.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, the developers felt Yasuke's experience as a foreigner in Japan would allow a global audience of players to see themselves in his journey as he immerses himself in the culture of the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach has precedent in the realm of popular fiction. James Clavell's 1975 book Shogun and the 2024 TV series of the same name introduce the fictional British sailor John Blackthorne (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_(samurai)">himself based on historical figure William Adams</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as an audience point-of-view character.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming students of history">Becoming students of history</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One particular detail that Dumont highlighted during the production was that Yasuke actor Tongayi Chirisa embodied the kind of mindset that they wanted for the character, possessing an open mind and a "student's mentality." This was the kind of aspect that they wanted for the character, but also a perspective that he wanted the developers to have as well when trying to develop Japan for AC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I always think of making games like these as going back to school; you have to go back to the learning process—you look back on what you know, then look at what you're learning, and then compare that to what's out there in pop culture," said Dumont. "So it's really about being students ourselves, trying to learn as much as possible and being humble about it. It can be difficult to portray somebody else's culture, so you try to have a lot of people who can inform you or help you make the right choices. Traveling to Japan was awesome, working with the specialists was great, and all that changed how we viewed the setting and how we developed it as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside Yasuke is Naoe, the second playable protagonist who focuses on stealth gameplay and the traditional 'assassin' experience. In a way, Naoe is an outsider like Yasuke, and her experience represents the spiritual and emotional element of the game that highlights the harmony between nature and humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Naoe's side activities hidden throughout the open world are meditation rituals, which open up side missions to see her growth as a ninja from her father's training. One major activity that players can engage in is the town builder, an Animal Crossing-style mode focusing on building a community of allies and creating a town of your own. In this way, players will be able to see the details of the architecture and culture of the time, as well as how people find unity during difficult times.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Working on this game completely changes how we perceive architecture, and how much nature and humanity are linked together in harmony in Japan," said Dumont. "When you go into temples and shrines and the wilderness, it's very clear that there's a strong connection with everything. We didn't understand at the start of this project, but as we did our research in Japan, we realized we needed to focus more on that. So, looking at everything, we were like, "Oh yeah, okay! We need to spend more time on that," and it's made our experience all the better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a clear shift away from 2020's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">focuses on a more tightly designed world, which aims to put a clear spotlight on a period of Japan that's opening itself up to the larger world and how the protagonists build up a community. According to Dumont, this all taps into the game's core themes of unity and community, which he says is "the importance of taking care of each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does focus on the traditional AC style of experience where players engage in brutal combat, pull off assassinations of key targets, and parkour across an open-world during a chaotic period, the deep historical research creates a surprisingly inviting and wholesome tone, one that breaks new ground in the world of games inspired by the dramatic history of Feudal Japan.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive.

Whereas most games that release in early access could potentially be there for months or years, Netmarble says in the game's FAQ it expects Game of Thrones: Kingsroad to be in early access for a "minimum of four weeks," after which it will be free-to-play.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC-eVMvcRBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hC-eVMvcRBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the early access period not all of the game will be available, though players will be able to explore the Northern regions of Westeros, encounter characters like Jon Snow, visit several major cities, complete various side quests, participate in co-op dungeons, and complete 50 chapters of the main storyline. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's full free-to-play launch will include more regions to explore, additional co-op dungeons, and more. Netmarble states more regions and challenges will be added post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain early access, players will need to purchase a Founder's Pack. The cheapest one is $25 and comes with a cosmetic "Northern" outfit, a Jon Snow emoji pack, and 350 of the game's Iron Mark currency. A $50 Founder's Pack nets owners the same plus the game's premium battle pass, additional outfits, horse mounts, a founder's title, and more currencies. A $90 version comes with all of the above plus a Direwolf mount, mount equipment, an upgraded premium battle pass, and even more currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120"></a><figcaption>A breakdown of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's various Founder's Packs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once Game of Thrones: Kingsroad comes out of Steam early access and additionally launches on mobile, it will feature full cross-play and cross-progression across platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will put players in the shoes of a customizable heir of a minor Northern lord who must navigate the dangerous politics of Westeros in order to restore their house's standing. It offers three different classes (Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin) to choose from, with combat that requires careful dodging and parrying to counter enemy attacks. Players can team up to fight "beasts of myth and legend" in the game's co-op dungeon mode, which will be required in order to earn components needed to make the game's best-quality gear.</p><p dir="ltr">While Netmarble's Game of Thrones title isn't the first third-person action-RPG set in Westeros (that honor goes to Cyanide Studios' 2012 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/game-of-thrones/" data-ref-id="5000-113588">Game of Thrones</a>), it almost certainly won't be the last. In a statement announcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shutdown of Monolith and two other studios last month</a>, Warner Bros. Games said it would look to focus on four popular IP for future projects, one of them being Game of Thrones.</p>

If the thrill of bopping <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' base game menagerie is starting to fade, you'll no doubt be wanting to know what's next for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's latest mega-hit</a>. And following a couple of previous teases, the publisher has now confirmed it'll be fully detailing Wilds' first major content update next Tuesday, 25th March.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase - the first since last month's launch - begins at 2pm in the UK/7am PT <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/monsterhunter">over on Twitch</a>. It'll be hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and is set delve into Monster Hunter Wilds' first free Title Update (as Capcom likes to call these things), which is scheduled to arrive in "early April".
</p>
<p>
We do, of course, already have a fairly good idea of what Title Update 1 will bring thanks to Capcom's previous chatter. It's set to introduce everybody's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune, for instance, as well as a "new place" for hunters to gather once they've completed the main story - so presumably the sort of centralised (and hopefully arm-wrestling enabled) social gathering hub we've seen in previous Monster Hunter games.

<p>
And finally in terms of earlier teases, Capcom's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">previously discussed a "new level of challenge"</a> for Wilds - one that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game. That's good news for everyone who (like me, in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">four star review</a>) felt Wilds' difficulty skewed a little low at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect the remaining Title Update 1 blanks to be filled (and hopefully some news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">much-needed performance improvements</a>) in Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase next week. To recap, things kick off next Tuesday, 25th March, at 2pm in the UK. And in the meantime, Capcom's got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-unveils-busy-in-game-event-schedule">full schedule of in-game events</a> to keep you occupied.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/out-of-the-blue-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-got-a-new-weapon-set-on-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Surprise! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has just gained a few more weapons on PC, thanks to the arrival of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281890/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard_Rooks_Weapons_Appearance_Offer/">Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle</a>.
</p>
<p>
This unexpected Steam freebie is available for PC players at no extra cost, and has popped up now while the game is currently on offer at a steep discount to £25, reduced by 50 percent from its base price of £50.
</p>
<p>
The release of these new weapons comes despite the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare has not only been downsized</a>, but had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">previously signalled the end of its support for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA described it as having underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1jfx3qk/bioware_released_a_weapons_set_dlc_today/">reddit</a>, where the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle was first discovered (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-new-dlc-free-march-20/">TheGamer</a>), fans have speculated that these weapons were already included within the game's files for use in a future promotion - meaning no new work to make them has actually gone on.
</p>

Eurogamer has contacted EA for more detail on the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle - and asked whether these items will also eventually become unlocked for those who own the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>Alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard's current deep sale on Steam, the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">popped up last month as part of Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription</a>.</p>
<p>EA recently raised eyebrows by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">suggesting that the game might have sold better if it had kept its live-service elements</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/id-probably-like-quit-former-dragon-age-leads-react-to-eas-suggestion-the-veilguard-should-have-been-live-service">something previous Dragon Age developers have scoffed at</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
