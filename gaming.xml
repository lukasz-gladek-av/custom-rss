                <p>One of the games that was said to have been canceled as part of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">latest wave of cuts</a> was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios</a>.

The report added that ZeniMax Online Studios was making a new game engine for it, which may have contributed to its lengthy development schedule.</p><p>Pre-production on Blackbird was "going well," the report said, adding that the studio was "actively ramping up" with the belief that the game could enter full production.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be featured at Summer Games Done Quick 2025.</p>
<p>Games Done Quick, for those unaware, is a series of charity video game marathons, which promise "high-level gameplay" from those with a lot more skill and patience than I have. </p>
<p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 will run from 6th - 13th July, with all donations raised going towards Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders. This organisation provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disease outbreaks, and disasters globally. Last year, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5m for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

<p>The event will include Knockout Tours in the Nintendo racer. Considering the amount of shortcuts found out in the game's open world, it'll be intriguing to see if world record times will be beaten.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-internal-and-external-saboteurs-for-mindseye-and-studio-struggles.1235232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy CEO Leslie Benzies reportedly finally addressed staff after the launch of MindsEye, blaming internal and external saboteurs for the game's and the studio's current struggles.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"> IGN</a>, the former producer of the Grand Theft Auto series addressed staff at the development studio yesterday, July 2, in a short video call. During the call, the Build a Rocket Boy CEO insisted the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye while blaming both the game's and the studio's struggles to internal and external saboteurs. This is the second time a similar suggestion was made by a BARB exec, as last month, co-CEO Mark Gerhard talked about a supposed concerted effort by some to trash the game and the studio.</p>



<p>Though there seems to be plans to relaunch MindsEye at some point, things are looking dire at the studio. At-risk emails have been sent to around 300 employees at Build a Rocket Boy and to staff at PlayFusion, which was acquired by BARB in late 2024. As such, the situation seems to be far worse than what it seemed<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> last month</a>, when it was confirmed that a layoff process began at the studio.</p>



<p>Few should be surprised to see MindsEye becoming more and more one of the most disastrous game launches of all time. The writing was on the wall even before release, when two BARB chief executives left the studio a few days before the release of the game. With a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">technical</a> and gameplay issues, relaunching the game will be a real challenge, and with layoffs looming on the horizon at the development studio, it remains to be seen if there are real plans to do so and how they will be realized.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is expected to have sold well in its first week of availability, moving close to 1.5 million units in just a few days.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a>, market research and analytics firm Ampere estimates that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach sold 1.4 million copies by the end of June in one week of availability. The game had a slower start than its predecessor in terms of physical copies across Europe, but digital sales are reportedly stronger. Considering how the original game continued to sell well even years after its launch, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions seems set to become a success.</p>



<p>Although Death Stranding 2: On The Beach doesn't significantly shake up its predecessor's formula, the huge number of quality-of-life additions and the much faster pace make it a more accessible and ultimately more enjoyable experience. Stealth and combat have also been improved significantly, and by taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a mechanic</a> that is not properly explained in-game, the entire experience turns into the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V we never got.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility Studio, a new development team comprised of industry veterans including longtime Sony Online Entertainment boss John Smedley, has announced its first project: a large-scale persistent online open-world first-person shooter called Reaper Actual. It's in development for PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a PvPvEvE game – sort of akin to an MMOFPS – set on the fictional island of Marova, which Smedley tells IGN is four times the size of Call of Duty Warzone's biggest map. You play a Reaper – effectively, a mercenary – and work for different factions. Up to 200 players can be on one server, and you'll be able to join Outfits (read: clans), use vehicles, and own bases – and of course raid them. Meanwhile, the AI is also playing against each other, and the human players can choose to get involved. Check out the first trailer for the Unreal Engine 5-powered game above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Reaper Actual - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility describes Reaper Actual's persistent online island as such: "Victories and defeats reshape the island’s control between PvP fights and NPC factions in real-time. Players will have a progression and crafting system to build the best gear, all of which stays in the world." Meanwhile, the studio's chief creative officer, Matt Higby, said, “We are moving toward the next level of persistent FPS combat. Players want a world they can live in and build upon. Having a solid base is only the start in Reaper Actual. Once faction missions interweave with PvP combat, the world becomes a swirling battleground of options for players. Mix that with a full crafting system and Reapers will grow every time you log in to play.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Left 4 Dead Director-style AI, Cerberus, will dynamically put players in conflict with each other by dishing out competing objectives for different Outfits.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Core player experiences are being designed around 3-4 player groups, with larger-scale Planetside 2-type scenarios as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professional wrestling is arguably one of the most involved forms of entertainment. In tandem with the gymnastic soap opera of never-ending stories, performers have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-aew-mason-madden-mxm-ring-of-honor-interview-1851634328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly reinvent themselves by concocting new gimmicks</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tricking out their toolkits</a>. One understated yet equally important part of a wrestler’s presentation is their theme song. A good theme song will rouse fans from their seats to cheer for their favorite wrestler as they either make an unexpected run-in, long-awaited return, or meteoric debut in a new company.&nbsp;</p><p>When a wrestler receives a new theme, there comes the threat of upending the aura they have worked so hard to garner with fans. Who writes these theme songs? YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRByFN6eWfRjUH0MajJhBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James “Little V” Mills</a> made a career out of making metal covers of popular video game songs before becoming the architect behind the theme song of AEW’s “God of Pro Wrestling,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Omega" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenny Omega</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bring Me The Horizon - Can You Feel My Heart (GIGACHAD Cover by Little V)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0wXU2PwY9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mills is prominently known on YouTube as a musician from Alberta, Canada, who creates “epic metal covers” of popular music from video games, anime, and internet memes. Since joining the platform in February 2010, Little V has amassed over a million subscribers, all tuning into his covers of songs like Casey Edward’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZJqWFXCDEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Devil May Cry 5</em> “Devil Trigger</a>”, Halogen’s 2017 internet earworm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8xoV-v1Yl0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“U Got That,”</a> and Yoasobi’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ko9M-K5FJnQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Oshi no Ko</em> anime theme song, “Idol.”</a> Ahead of Omega’s big match against longtime New Japan Pro Wrestling rival Kazuchika Okada at its upcoming PPV <a href="https://www.allelitewrestling.com/aew-event/aew-all-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AEW: All In Texas</a> on July 12, I spoke with Little V about how he came up with what would become the most popular theme song in the company for its golden wrestler.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Little V Mills</span></figcaption></figure><p>As fate would have it, Little V’s reputation as the artist behind metal video game covers preceded him, leading Omega to DM him on Twitter and ask if he could make him a new theme song to debut at AEW’s inaugural pay-per-view Double or Nothing in 2019.</p><p>“I believe the message was, ‘Hey, sorry to just slip into your DMs, but you’re Canadian, I’m Canadian’… and I said ‘I’m down,’” Little V recalled. “He had seen my work through YouTube and that’s why he reached out.”</p><p>Like WWE’s Megapowers, their out of the blue Canuck connection spurned Little V’s new responsibility for engineering a theme song for one of wrestling’s modern greats. However, despite that bond, Little V had a bit of an uphill battle in creating the theme. The musician had only a tertiary knowledge of wrestling; he watched it from time to time, and he was well aware of Omega, but he hadn’t tuned into Omega’s star-making time in NJPW. As a result, Little V felt he needed to do his due diligence to learn as much as possible about the wrestler. To do so, he turned to a fellow YouTuber and sicko for professional wrestling, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@supereyepatchwolf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Eyepatch Wolf</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Professional Wrestling is Stupid and Beautiful and I Love it" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQCPj-bGYro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“As soon as [Omega] reached out, I reached out to another adjacent to the world we belong to, Super Eyepatch Wolf,” Little V told me. “EyepatchWolf was a huge fan of Kenny Omega's, and I was just like, ‘Hey, so, can you give me some background on him? I'm trying to get him a theme.’ I believe [Eyepatch Wolf’s messages were, ‘What? Huh? Um. Er. What?’ in a row.” Little V said EyepatchWolf sent him a “short novel” that incorporated everything about Kenny Omega to get him up to speed on the lore.&nbsp;</p><p>In the international wrestling community, themes often walk a fine line between iconic and generic-sounding. Case in point: WWE superstar CM Punk’s visible confusion at Logan Paul’s theme song, a common <a href="https://www.bloodyslam.com/news/fans-demand-wwe-to-fire-def-rebel-amid-reports-of-talents-frustration-over-the-new-music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticism that fans levy at the company's theme composer Def Rebel.</a> To ensure his first foray into crafting a wrestling theme song wouldn’t fall into the same trap, Little V and Omega came up with some ideas that they felt celebrated Omega’s wrestling career as well as the video games his moveset are an homage to, like <a href="https://youtu.be/ooMm_xsRRyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Street Fighter</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/E_WNaso8A_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>. Omega specifically requested that the anthem sound “synthwavey” with musical stylings comparable to “Turbo Killer” by Carpenter Brut.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="† Carpenter Brut † TURBO KILLER † Directed by Seth Ickerman † Official Video †" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/er416Ad3R1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Independent of Eyepatch Wolf’s extensive Omega lore dump and the wrestler’s suggestions, Little V conducted some research by listening to Omega’s previous NJPW theme, “<a href="https://youtu.be/n2dVbk0iROM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devil’s Sky</a>”, and drew sonic inspiration from wrestling themes like Shinsuke Nakamura’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjZM5zFGuA&amp;pp=ygUbd3dlIHNoaW5zdWtlIG5ha2FtdXJhIHRoZW1l0gcJCcMJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rising Sun</a>” and CM Punk’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buafAa8Gobo&amp;pp=ygUlbGl2aW5nIGNvbG91ciBjdWx0IG9mIHBlcnNvbmFsaXR5IHd3ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult of Personality</a>” by Living Colour.</p><p>“I need something catchy, fun, and memorable. As soon as you hear it, it's recognizable and gets everybody excited,” Little V said. “I'm a sucker for a good hook—something you can chant along with it.”</p><p>Ultimately, it took Little V around a month to piece together the song, “Battle Cry,” from concept to final track.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenny Omega entrance at AEW Double or Nothing HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5XkY_RsJ8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“We actually nailed it pretty much immediately. I think I sent him the first draft, and he said, 'Yeah, no, this is great.' But, really funny thing with that, ‘Battle Cry’ was an instrumental at first. It did not have any lyrics,” Little V said. “It wasn’t until the first Double or Nothing when he was facing Chris Jericho, and Kenny came out to the instrumental that I was like ‘Hold on.’ I literally got up—I didn't even finish watching the match— and walked over to my office and wrote the lyrics and recorded them that night.”</p><p>“The next day, I was like, ‘Kenny, I made lyrics. I re-recorded it here, tell me what you think.’ And he's like, 'This is great, this is fantastic,' and that's how it continued,” Little V said. “It was originally an instrumental, [but] watching it in the context, I'm like, ‘This needs something. This needs lyrics. This needs something to grab onto. I need to make it so it's chantable and fun to sing along with.’”</p><p>He continued, “It was interesting how it evolved literally from the first match of like, ‘Oh God, I gotta do something ‘cause right now— it's not that it sounds generic—it's missing something for the whole package.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Little V - Battle Cry (Kenny Omega's AEW Theme)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOLiZ6qAWPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When it came to writing lyrics to “Battle Cry” that referenced video game lingo and Omega’s wrestling career, Little V made no qualms about the song being “pretty cheesy.”</p><p>“Let’s call a spade a spade, but I feel like it’s really appropriate. I literally called it ‘Battle Cry’ because of [Omega’s theme] ‘Devil’s Sky.’ [From] ‘one wing angel’ [to] ‘best bout machine,’ I was just like, ‘Let me throw as many references as I can in here. I’m not even gonna be subtle. I’m just gonna slap everyone in the face with it,’” Little V said. “I think it turned out well because a lot of people still love ['Devil's Sky'] even though it's been almost six years since he initially reached out.”&nbsp;</p><p>Little V recalled that Kenny Omega had some initial hesitance around the lyrics, primarily because he’d never worked with a vocal theme before. For Little V, though, crafting a wrestling theme didn’t feel far off from composing a song like a boss battle track for a video game. The real pressure came from knowing the track had to live up to Kenny Omega’s legacy for the IWC—as Omega warned him, wrestling fans are fiercely protective of their favorites, and any sudden change, especially in a theme song, would take them some time to warm up to.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's Kenny Omega. Everyone knows his previous theme song and everyone knows Kenny Omega [so] I'm like, ‘Oh crap, I gotta make sure I don't make something bad.’ I figure it's kind of like anime themes where everyone hates the new theme until about a month in, and then everyone loves the new theme opening,” Little V said. “I've been on the internet long enough to have people yell at me. I think I'm OK with this.”</p><p>As evidenced by “Battle Cry” currently ranking as the most popular song on All Elite Wrestling’s Spotify with over seven million listens, Little V is delighted with how the song panned out. Moreover, he’s touched by how full circle it's all become, leading to folks posting their covers of his track on YouTube.<br></p><p>“As a guy who does primarily covers, it's been very nice to see that,” Little V said.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenny Omega returns to in-ring action vs Callis Family’s Brian Cage! | 1/15/25, AEW Dynamite" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUklBIJRhR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Even after Kenny Omega introduced an alternative theme, “Take Flight”—a collaboration between <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-ff-final-fantasy-14-composer-kenny-omega-new-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>’s Masayoshi Soken, vocalist Jason Miller, and the legendary Nobuo Uematsu</a>–to mark his return after recovering from diverticulitis surgery, Little V remains deeply humbled by fans who continue to celebrate his original mainstay anthem.</p><p>“It wasn't just like a complete like, ‘OK, this is a new theme song now,’” Little V said, regarding “Take Flight.” “It's been really cool to see that I was able to have that big of an impact on people and it makes me feel happy that I did a good job, because I don't want to screw up someone's wrestling theme song. That would suck.”&nbsp;</p><p>Little V said that he doesn’t make residuals for the track anytime AEW broadcasts it on TV.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a one-time deal. I won’t go too far into it. There were some discussions of other things in the background, but it panned out that way, and I’m okay with that. I got paid a pretty good amount. No royalties—doesn’t work that way.”</p><p>Regardless, having created the theme song for one of the flagship wrestlers and executive vice president of a company that stands as <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-elite-wrestling-has-made-professional-wrestling-fun-1847651647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the counter-culture to wrestling’s longtime oligarch, WWE</a>, Little V feels a sense of pride in having left his footprint in the burgeoning company’s legacy and identity.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s incredibly humbling. The fact that it turned into being such a really popular theme, I'm really thankful that I had the opportunity to do it. It's led me to also write themes for other wrestlers as well,” Little V said. “Six years later, and it still gets me excited when I tune in, it pops on, and I hear the whole crowd losing it. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to do that.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer"><h3>Has Xbox Considered Laying One Person Off Instead Of Thousands</h3></a><p>None of the people being laid off were responsible for the decisions that have led to these layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Hit Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble Put On Life Support</h3></a><p>No new content for Warcraft Rumble as Blizzard departments like marketing and customer service are also impacted</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Sweep Xbox [Updating]</h3></a><p>Several in-development games have been canceled, including Perfect Dark and Everwild</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles on 26th August, Arrowhead has announced, the game still being published by PlayStation and ported with the help of Sony’s porting specialists at Nixxes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 – Deploying on Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Helldivers 2 will arrive on Xbox with full cross-play to PlayStation and PC, and both Helldivers 2 standard edition and Super Citizen Edition are now available to pre-order on the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement post, game director Mikael Eriksson said, “We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p>
<p>While Microsoft has wholly embraced multiplatform game releases, bringing a number of their core franchises and new releases to PlayStation over the last few years, Sony has always resisted this. Or they’ve resisted propping up their competitor with their key single player titles. While Sony’s ambitions for more live service hits have floundered, the nature and need of these games to have a large player base to sustain them has meant that Sony’s been more open to cross-platform releases… they’ve just not really had the chance to prove it outside of Bungie still being allowed to announced Marathon for Xbox.</p>

<p>This is a pleasant surprise, then, and one that I’m sure many Xbox gamers will be keen to jump aboard and try out. Over the past year and a half, Helldivers 2 has continually evolved, first through the initial flurry of interest and early narrative twists in the Galactic War. As the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/13/helldivers-2-bugs-can-fly-now-despite-what-arrowheads-boss-tells-you/">Terminid</a> and Automaton threats were pushed back, late last year saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">the Illuminate start to emerge</a>, building up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/war-comes-to-super-earth-in-helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update/">a full scale invasion that reached Super Earth itself</a>.</p>
<p>What kind of story will play out next, we don’t know, but having fresh Xbox gamers will certainly help.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the must-play games of the start of 2024, rapidly becoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-sells-12-million-to-become-playstations-new-fastest-selling-game/">PlayStation’s fastest-selling game</a>. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">our Helldivers 2 review</a>, I said, “A naked shower scene away from being an official Starship Troopers game, Helldivers 2 is gloriously daft fun when you can get a group of friends together to play. It’s just a shame about the matchmaking and crash bugs at launch.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo was clearly determined to improve some of the core failings of the original Nintendo Switch, including how easy it was for players to get pirated software onto the console. In the beginning, all it took was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip</a> to dismantle the Nintendo Switch, while Nintendo could do nothing but watch, and eventually release an updated model of the original Switch to stop the paper clip trick from working.</p>



<p>Nintendo has upped its game, so to speak, in its fight against piracy on the Nintendo Switch 2, with the threat of Nintendo bricking the device remotely hanging over the head of anyone willing to try and use their Switch 2 in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">"<em>unauthorized</em>" way</a>. Players have described this kind of power to brick the whole device and not just ban the account of someone attempting to jailbreak their console as an overreach from Nintendo, but individual players can't exactly do much to get in Nintendo's way over it.</p>



<p>Procon-SP, however, is trying to get in Nintendo's way on behalf of Brazilian Nintendo Switch 2 owners. The Sau Paulo branch of Brazil's Consumer Protection and Defense organization has <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">published a press release</a> (spotted by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/02/brazil-nintendo-is-now-facing-legal-action-over-ability-to-brick-switch-2-console/">My Nintendo News</a>) in which it calls the clauses around bricking the device in the contract that every Nintendo Switch 2 owner and Nintendo Switch Online account holder agrees to "<em>abusive</em>."</p>



<p>To be clear, Procon-SP's issues with Nintendo are more around how the company can remotely and permanently cut off services that Brazilian consumers have paid for without a proper explanation. Procon-SP is asking that Nintendo change the wording in its EULA per its requests, with Nintendo now saying it will review Procon-SP's complaint and respond within the next 20 days. Nintendo's current EULA reads "<em>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions, Nintendo may render the Console and/or the Software permanently unusable in whole or in part</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see if Nintendo changes the wording, or if Procon-SP takes this complaint even further, prompting potential legal action.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Hideo Kojima <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">reiterated</a> that he'd really like to make a video game in space, much to Mark's despair and outrage. Perhaps "how do we send Hideo Kojima into outer space" can be one of the problems they solve in the Spaceship Game Jam, a collaboration between the Finnish Game Jam and the European Space Agency, in which starry-eyed developers "design and prototype games or playful concepts inspired by real-world space issues". </p><!--more-->
<p>The event runs August 29th to August 31st. You can join the proceedings in-person at specified sites around Finland, or participate online. There's no entry fee, nor do you need to know what "outer space" is to apply. "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/curiosity">Curiosity</a> and a desire to explore are the only requirements," the organisers explain (yes, I'm aware this website's fiendish autotagging software has just linked "curiosity" to Peter Molyneux's smartphone-chiselling abomination; no, I do not know how to stop it). I think "cosmic dread" should be one of the entry criteria as well. I mean, half the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a> on Steam are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>.</p>
<p>Why not just host my own damn spacejam, you imperiously enquire, rather than waiting for those stuffed shirts at the ESA to give their blessing? Well, "participants will gain exclusive access to a rich collection of data and assets generously provided by ESA," <a href="https://spaceshipgamejam.org/faq/">according to the project's website</a>. "This collection will include data from satellites, research missions, telescopes, and more, to inspire and enrich your games."</p>
<p>I find the Spaceship Game Jam interesting inasmuch as I'm interested in the overlap between private or public sector space exploration and the video games industry. I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nasa-video-games-call-of-duty-mars">wrote a bit about that for Eurogamer</a>, back in the day, though frankly, I think the piece in question is a sanctimonious blatherfest, so let me extract some highlights: NASA have a sideline in video games development or partnerships with developers as part of their campaign for greater public awareness and, thereby, funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</a> was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/06/27/why-infinite-warfares-space-battles-are-more-grounded-than-you-think.aspx">designed with input from NASA consultants</a>, and NASA has also teamed up with Blackbird Interactive, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Eagle">construct a simulation of a hypothetical 22nd century Martian colony in the Gale Crater</a>. NASA have also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/jedis-to-astronauts-how-nasa-tapped-video-game-maker-for-training.html">made use of educational games for astronaut training</a>.</p>
<p>As for the European Space Agency, they've <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Branding_and_Partnerships/ESA_connects_space_exploration_and_video_games_at_Gamescom_2024">hosted stands at Gamescom</a> in a bid to recruit the next generation of geeks, and are presently working with Life Is Strange developers Don't Nod on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dontnod-are-working-with-the-european-space-agency-to-make-sci-fi-adventure-game-aphelion">sci-fi adventure game Aphelion</a>. Perhaps if you take part in their game jam, you'll be able to reboot yourself as a professional rocket scientist and help poor, befuddled Kojima escape the tyranny of gravity. He'll get his arse to Mars someday.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-hither-wannabe-astronauts-the-european-space-agency-are-doing-a-spaceship-game-jam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox Series X/S on August 26. This marks the first appearance of the series on a Microsoft platform.</p><p>The cooperative third-person shooter was first released on February 8, 2024, for PlayStation 5 and PC. As soldiers defending Super Earth in 2184, players work together in three-person squads to fight in the never-ending Galactic War against the insect-like aliens, the Terminids (among other threats). Helldivers 2 on Xbox will support cross-play on all platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," says Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><p>This announcement is notable because while we've seen several first-party Xbox titles make the jump to PlayStation hardware in the last year, this is a more uncommon instance of a Sony-published game migrating to Microsoft's console. Helldivers 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024. We scored it a 9 out of 10 upon its release (check out our<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"> review</a>), and it also landed a spot on our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a935b4561cf2d/tamagotchi-plaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with an updated look at the Japanese physical charts, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46365">Famitsu</a>, and while pole position has remained ever-steady, a couple of newbies have shaken up the rest of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Surprising nobody, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is <em>still</em> in first place after having put up an additional 145,069 sales in its fourth week in the top spot. But it's not quite as one-sided as you might expect this time, thanks to a staggering debut from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, which combined for a sweet 128,685 units across its Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2</a> releases. As it turns out, yes, Tamagotchi <em>is</em> still A Thing.</p>
<p>It wasn't a complete Switch-fest, of course, with Kojima's latest, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, squeezing the PS5 onto the podium after pulling in a cool 71,964 sales in its first week. AQUAPLUS's remastered visual novel <strong>ToHeart</strong> and the physical release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a> managed to break the top 10 in the debut week, too. <em>Cor</em>, what a time for new releases!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-to-focus-on-naughty-dog.1235136/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Neil Druckmann, best known for his work as creative lead on Naughty Dog's successful&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series, has announced he will step down from his "creative involvement" with HBO's adaptation of the games in order to focus on his work with Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Druckmann says the decision to step away from the show was "difficult", but that he wants to "transition [his] complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming <i>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</i></a>, on which Druckmann serves as writer and director.</p>

<p>Druckmann says that working on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series as a co-creator "has been a career highlight", and that now, after the completion of series two and "before any meaningful work starts on season three", is the "right time" to step away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-hbo-joel-ellie.jpg?itok=6oNAxVsA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-hbo-joel-ellie.jpg?itok=F2ujDyRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his role on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The first season of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-episode-1-review" rel="nofollow">debuted back in early 2023</a>, quickly earning critical acclaim for its faithfulness to the source material, as well as for the performances of leads Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who play Joel and Ellie respectively.</p>

<p>When the second season aired earlier this year, the response from audiences, as well as some critics, was decidedly more muted. Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">awarded the season a 7 out of 10</a>, praising its set dressing and Pascal's performance but criticizing "pacing issues".</p>

<p>A third season of the show is on the way, and given that the second season didn't conclude the story of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em>, we can reasonably assume that the upcoming season will do so.</p>




<p>As for the games, as far as we know, there's no third installment in development, although Druckmann has said before that he believes there <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-creative-director-there-is-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story" rel="nofollow">could be "one more chapter"</a> to the story the games tell.</p>

<p>Given that Naughty Dog is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, however, and given the sheer amount of time games take to make these days, I wouldn't bank on seeing a third&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>game for quite some time yet.</p>

            <p>Romero Games have announced in the wake of mass layoffs at Microsoft that funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> has been pulled by its publisher. A number of former staff at the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero have since written on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">MS cuts</a>.</p>
<p>A statement posted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/romero-games">Romero Games</a>' Twitter account attributed to Brenda Romero asserts that the game's publisher, which it didn't name, had opted to pull the funding for it "along with several other unannounced projects at other studios".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control," Romero continued. "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome. This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with.”</p>
<p>Following the statement being put out, a number of now-former Romero Games devs have posted on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox. These include hard surface artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl</a>, senior 3D character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477302404329472/">Conor Jordan</a>, and senior producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477777308573697/">Emily Winters</a>.

<p>"The mass Microsoft layoff effectively cancelled funding for Romero Games and as a result the whole team was laid off," wrote former Romero Games UI artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346535464591355909/">Ana Mitrovic</a>. Meanwhile fellow former artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346495054519173120/">Sadbh Flanagan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346522896481034241/">Eric Wong</a> both referenced the studio closing in their posts.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>"We appreciate any attention you can bring to our talented team who are now looking for work," Romero Games community developer and communications manager Maezza Romero wrote in response to a request for comment RPS made to the studio. "I have to refer you back to our public post, which is in keeping with our confidentiality agreement."</p>
<p>The original statement closes by saying that Romero Games are "currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for more than 20 years," it goes on. "It’s an extremely difficult day, and we’re heartbroken it’s come to this."</p>
<p>"These people are the best people I've ever worked with," John Romero added on social media, "and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is officially coming to Xbox Series X/S on the 26th August.</p>
<p>This announcement came via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIFF4D6LOs&amp;ab_channel=HELLDIVERS%E2%84%A22">a Helldivers announcement stream</a>. Arrowhead's hit third-person shooter will have full crossplay with both PC and PlayStation. Those interested can pre-order the game on the Xbox store  for £34.99 now.</p>
<p>It's also the first ever Sony-published game on Xbox platforms, which is certainly a massive milestone in the ongoing rivalry between the two companies (Sony's baseball series MLB The Show is published by MLB on Xbox). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony previously expressed interest in bringing its big games to more platforms</a>, with this Helldivers 2 port acting as the first big sign of this shift in strategy.

We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-removes-pc-sale-restrictions-in-dozens-of-countries-for-four-huge-playstation-games">Helldivers 2 only recently had its geographical restrictions lifted on PC</a>, which had previously had people from countries including the Bahamas, Armenia, Burkina Faso and many more unable to play the smash hit. Now, with the game coming to Xbox, it looks like one more massive wall keeping folks apart has crumbled.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent acquired a 15 percent stake in Arrowhead Games</a> for roughly $80m. A lofty sum for a chunk of what has certainly been a rare gem in the modern live service landscape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will soon break out of its console exclusivity prison, PlayStation and Xbox have announced, as the bug-slaying shooter is due to land on Xbox Series X|S later this summer.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news platform,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will be released on Xbox Series X|S on August 26th. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">the same date</a> on which<i>&nbsp;Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>lands on PS5.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, no specific enhancements or unique features will be introduced for the Xbox version of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although you will net yourself some extra goodies if you pre-order either the standard version or the Super Citizen Edition of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=clTAExid 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=-nOmHKTH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like porting work for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>was handled by Nixxes, a celebrated porting and support studio that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-has-acquired-porting-studio-nixxes" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>. The studio has also helped out with PC ports for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>.</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, it's a co-op-focused third-person shooter in which players band together to slay enemies belonging to one of three factions: the insectoid Terminids, the robotic Automatons, and the alien Illuminate.</p>

<p>The game's theming is heavily satirical; while players are routinely encouraged to support Super Earth and its introduction of "managed democracy" to the galaxy, in truth, Super Earth's government is much closer to an autocratic regime.</p>

<p>Missions revolve around completing a series of objectives while fending off enemies from the three aforementioned factions, and with friendly fire not only present but constant, I'd recommend playing with those with whom your friendship is ironclad.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/helldivers-2/9mx9wn9dfpgt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> when it launches on Microsoft's hardware on August 26th. The game is also currently available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>

What initially seems like a serious sci-fi title often gives way to funny, emergent moments, thanks in part to its Strategem system, which requires you to input complex button combos while facing down swarms of enemies. There are a variety of missions you can take on against aliens, robots, and a newer Illuminate species. And, since it’s a live-service title, the lore and the stakes are always evolving (and the developers often troll players). It’s a fun world to be immersed in, even if you’re just grinding the free battle pass for weapon upgrades.</p><p>My former <em>Polygon </em>colleague Cass Marshall wrote some incredible <em>Helldivers 2</em> coverage, which have the power to convince just about anyone that they were missing out on a good time.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been a long time since the last major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> update and it'll likely be a while till the next. This might strike you as dismal news, if you adhere to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">"death by a thousand patches"</a> school of Steam early access, but you have to remember that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> is a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> set in late 14th-century Franconia, when technology <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">lolled along at the pace of a drunken ox</a>. Also, the developers Slavic Magic are carrying out a "full rework" of the game, rather than dolling things out in smaller patches. In particular, there's a new building affinity system in development that may please fans of pollination. Any flowers reading this? The next update is for you, I guess.</p><!--more-->
<p>"I know you've been waiting a long time, and the reason for the delay is pretty simple," begins <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/505080786253252678?l=english">a Steam post</a> from lead developer Grzegorz Styczeń. "We're overhauling a lot of systems at once. It's not just a new feature or two. It's a full rework of how things like buildings, production chains, and environmental interactions function. Because we're working on all these big changes, we haven't been able to put out smaller patches. They would make things messy or break stuff that's still being worked on."</p>
<p>The developers plan to shift to smaller, more regular updates once the "full rework" is done.</p>
<p>Ever the giver, Styczeń closed the post with a few highlights from the forthcoming megapatch. These include a "more in-depth relational system" between buildings and between buildings and the environment. They experimented initially with applying building effects across a radius, as in many other city builders, but this disagreed with the Manor Lords plot system. Besides which, Styczeń feels that "fitting rectangular plots into circles is not pleasant, and it reduces the creativity the player has".</p>
<p>Gah, I can picture how annoying this would have been. I can imagine the hours I'd have spent gnawing my fingernails over stray wedges and curls of unexploited affinity radius. How I'd have cursed your name, Greg. Such plagues I'd have called upon your houses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Slavic Magic are going with a system of matching environment types, instead. So far, the types include Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Rural, and Urban. Buildings have affinities with specific environments: apiaries like sharing a region with some woodland, for example. There are buffs and multipliers to ponder, too: apiaries increase the bonuses that pollination orchards get from meadows, while placing fresh houses appears to proportionately increase urban affinity.</p>

<p>Sweaty questions of infrastructure chemistry aside, Slavic Magic are working on a new map, Divided, which as the name suggests has a mountain range running down the middle. They've also shared screens of new shop fronts and artisan workstations, see-through fortifications for those who want to ensure that their castle guards aren't nodding off, a new development perk card style, and a whole raft of reworked building cards. Consider all this subject to change, naturally.</p>
<p>Even in early access form, Manor Lords is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">favourite city builders</a>, and an appetisingly mucky simulation of medieval life. It even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us"><em>sounds</em> like a flyblown heap of feudalism</a>. I look forward to rearranging my apiaries.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-is-getting-a-full-rework-with-a-new-affinity-system-map-shops-and-workstations]]></content:encoded>

That’s not entirely relevant, but it’s also the name of a puzzle format created by legendary Japanese puzzle publisher Nikoli. Like so many other puzzling conceits, it begins on a square grid, with numbers scattered across various tiles, and the inherent demand is that the player eliminate squares until the puzzle is solved. But Nurikabe is a little different than others.</p><p>The basic idea here is to create a contiguous path of eliminated/shaded cells, such that each numbered tile is boxed off in an island containing the appropriate number of cells. If there’s a 2, it needs to be the 2 tile and one other blank, sealed off from others by all orthogonal routes. However, what makes Nurikabe more involved is that it has other rules that apply—there can be no two-by-two shaded areas, for instance. And that path of eliminated space must be orthogonally linked across the whole grid. It’s with these pieces of information that you can deduce possible solutions, in a way that’s far more involving and interesting than a bog-standard sudoku or what have you.</p><p>That’s Nurikabe, but what about <em>Nurikabe World</em>? Well, for the most part it’s this exact puzzling format, but presented in a stunningly clever and engaging way that makes it feel so much more special. And beyond that, it invents its own twists on the format, introducing new rules that require even more inventive thinking.</p><p><em>Nurikabe World</em> takes the islands metaphor literally, having you eliminate cells on its 3D levels by turning land into water. As such, each puzzle has you carve a river through the green land that successfully isolates each numbered island, with the logic that the river itself must be linked up throughout. Once an island has been segregated into the correct number of tiles, the green grass then blossoms with plants, trees and traditional Japanese buildings, growing out of the ground in lovely animations. Absolutely, it’s all decoration, but it’s so superbly delivered that it makes the puzzles feel far more meaningful, and delivers a continuous sense of being rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>It helps that the enormous 150 levels are all hand-crafted, rather than procedurally generated, and like the best puzzles, demonstrate the wit and intelligence of the creator. For the first few dozens, as specific techniques become unavoidably necessary to solve the level, the concept will be explicitly explained—but rather brilliantly this happens long after you should have stumbled upon them for yourself if you’re paying attention. They’re only overtly explained when you’d be screwed without them.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-recommend-id="image://f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1438" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hemisquare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-recommend-id="image://f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1438" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then, in the second half of the collection, new twists are added. There are numbers with dots beneath them, indicating that these must be paired with another dotted number, their island representing the paired sum. Working out which two numbers are to be paired of the many available becomes a fascinating new challenge. Then there are numbers with lines underneath, which must form islands made in a straight line. And at the game’s best, all three number types appear in the same puzzle, meaning you need to weave all these freshly learned techniques together.</p><p>The final of the four groups of puzzles is called “Advance,” and contains far more meaty challenges, and it’s from midway through this collection that I write to you. I was not intending to be playing this game at all this week. I wrote about it last week <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/nurikabe-world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/nurikabe-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my own little site</a></span>, and had meant to move on by now. But there it is, in the background, distracting me as I try to get through this sentence.</p><p>And when you’re done with the 150 puzzles, there are daily challenges too, and user-made puzzles to add and create!</p><p>Logic puzzle games are certainly pretty commonplace, but one designed and presented this well is a rare treat. And right now, in the Steam summer sale, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964540/Nurikabe_World/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964540/Nurikabe_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s 25 percent off at just $7.50</a></span>. That’s incredibly good value for puzzling money! Although, perhaps don’t make other plans.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nurikabe-world-logic-puzzle-game-hemisquare-1851785568]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plans to relaunch the game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, has issued at-risk emails to its around 300-strong UK workforce following the disastrous launch of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sources familiar with the goings on inside the embattled studio told IGN at-risk emails were also sent to staff at PlayFusion, which BARB acquired late 2024. PlayFusion, whose CEO Mark Gerhard became co-CEO of BARB as part of the buyout, is working on a different game — a fast-paced FPS called Ascendant which was meant to come out this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN reported that BARB had begun a redundancy process following the release of MindsEye</a>. The standard 45-day consultation process kicked off on June 23, which according to UK law is triggered when an employer proposes 100 or more redundancies within a 90-day period. IGN understands Build A Rocket Boy currently has around 300 UK employees, with 200 abroad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, BARB issued a statement confirming the redundancy process, insisting the cuts will let the studio “focus on delivering ongoing updates and performance optimization for MindsEye, while also ensuring the long-term success of Build A Rocket Boy’s future ambitions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after MindsEye launched, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>BARB said it was “heartbroken” over the issues players had faced with the game</u></a>, and promised to release a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior bugs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch"><u>Rollout of these patches has begun</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MindsEye’s troubled launch saw the developer cancel sponsored streams, with reports of players securing refunds, even from the normally stubborn Sony, surfacing online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 46 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 26 people were playing on Steam, where MindsEye has a 'mostly negative' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BARB sources told IGN that Benzies finally addressed staff following the release of MindsEye in a brief video call yesterday, July 2. According to two people present who asked not to be named in order to protect their careers, Benzies insisted BARB would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming the studio and the game’s struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments rekindle memories of those issued by Mark Gerhard ahead of the release of MindsEye. The co-CEO hit the headlines for claiming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>there was a "concerted effort" by some to "trash the game and the studio,"</u></a> suggesting people were being paid or using spam bots to post negative comments. The boss of publisher IO Interactive, which makes the Hitman games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>subsequently issued a denial</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BARB sources told IGN that internally, there is a desire for a MindsEye redemption arc that would eventually see it become successful for the studio. But as staff face an anxious wait to discover their fate, there are serious questions over whether BARB will be able to fulfill its post-launch roadmap for content, including the promised multiplayer mode, on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, BARB released MindsEye’s third post-release update on console, with a PC release to follow. “We’ve watched hundreds of hours of gameplay footage and reviewed player feedback across multiple channels to prioritize the most pressing issues and improve the experience for all our console players,” the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
