It doesn't include any <strong>Yo-Kai Watch</strong>, but come on, we're not miracle workers...</p>
<p>"We have lots of new developments planned for the future," Hino wrote in the artwork's caption (translated via Google), "so we hope you will continue to support us".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tuqrzx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>After the stellar launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> earlier this year, the next Level-5 project we have to look forward to is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, which <em>should</em> finally arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on 14th November. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> and DECAPOLICE have been delayed to 2026, so we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on either of them.</p>
<p>After that, we've got the remade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/inazuma_eleven_re">Inazuma Eleven RE</a> and whatever Holy Horror Mansion turns out to be. In short, it looks like Level-5 is sticking around for the foreseeable future. Let's just hope that the quality can stick around with it.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Dean Hall, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> and more recently Icarus, has called out Valve regarding the use of gambling-related monetisation methods in its games.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Hall said, "It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about. I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in video games at all - they have absolutely no place.</p>
<p>"My challenge to game developers," he added, "is that if they think these things are not a problem, they make the data available to universities who are crying out to study this stuff."</p>
<p>Hall's remarks refer to loot boxes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which offer weapon and armour skins that can be traded with other players and so fuel a multi-billion dollar marketplace surrounding the game - a marketplace that includes significant betting activity.</p><p>Loot boxes have generally been moved away from after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-university-reports-loot-boxes-cause-financial-and-emotional-harm-to-children">multiple countries commissioned investigations into their use</a> and the effect they were having on younger minds. But Valve sidestepped the resulting regulations by changing the loot box system so you pay for the contents inside the box rather than the box itself.</p>
<p>Hall's comments came while speaking to me about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creators-survival-game-icarus-is-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-soon-but-it-wont-have-cross-play">survival game Icarus</a>, which was originally going to be free-to-play before it switched to the expensive DLC model it has now - the Paradox model, as Hall calls it. It's a divisive model but RocketWerkz - Hall's studio - needed to use it in order to survive, he told me.</p>
<p>Players aren't the only ones who are unhappy with it. "I'm not happy either," Hall said. "I agree with a lot of the people who get mad about the DLC approach. I don't really like the Icarus approach. We needed it to survive.</p>
<p>"I actually think a lot of gamers don't realise that 99 percent of devs out there are sitting there going, I don't like this. So who's winning? Because it's sure not us. There's a lot of game studios like mine that are just holding on and trying to keep making the games we want to make, but not necessarily happy with how they monetise."</p>

<figcaption>This is a nice overview of where Kitten Space Agency is at.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2IGlOBWQm8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Hall's answer to this problem may come in Kitten Space Agency, the unashamed and somewhat blatant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> follow-up that RocketWerkz is working on now. The idea is to make it free - free with the option of a contribution if you want to pay.</p><p>"I want to find a different way," he said. "We've got to do something. We've got to try something. And if there's ever a game that deserves trying that, it's a KSP-style game. That's one game I think maybe we can try and do something different with. We say games can inspire, and inspiration should be free, which is kind of a tagline with KSA. I think the game deserves better, I really do - I think the game deserves to be free."</p>
<p>Kitten Space Agency doesn't have a release date yet but testing is starting to open out, albeit to select guests at the moment. Whether or not an optional fee will work for Kitten Space Agency, and whether the income it generates will be enough for RocketWerkz to survive on, remains to be seen. Life has been tough for the New Zealand studio; the launch of Icarus four years ago nearly dragged it under. But as I discussed in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creator-dean-hall-is-a-changed-man-after-years-of-living-the-high-life-hes-focused-on-saving-a-studio-that-flew-too-close-to-the-sun">a candid interview with Dean Hall</a>, things are starting to turn around.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> is just about to launch on the Switch 2, and to celebrate, Sega has announced another new DLC expansion scheduled to launch this winter.</p>
<p>Dubbed 'Zooseum', it's essentially, well... a zoo. It's a brand new location that will no doubt introduce a smorgasbord of interesting creatures to care for as you look to expand your blossoming museum even further.</p>
<p>Details are rather scarce at the moment, so we don't have a firm release date for the expansion just yet, but it's nice to know that it's coming, at least.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this wild new DLC, a brand new museum location dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife will open its doors. Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our recent review for Two Point Museum, we said that it's probably the best entry in the series yet, but lamented the lack of mouse controls and some apparent performance issues on the Switch 2. Be sure to read our full verdict if you're currently on the fence.</p>

			<p>Anchor is a new underwater survival game from developer Fearem, which essentially mashes the kind of harsher survival crafting that players love in Rust with the underwater setting of Subnautica to create a new experience.</p>



<p>Set in a dystopian world where a nuclear apocalypse has sent humanity into the ocean to try and find a new way to survive, you'll be able to join up with other players in the 150-player servers or lone shark your underwater journey as you try to survive on your own.</p>



<p>It'll also feature PvE modes for those who don't want to deal with the threat of other players on top of all the other dangers that come with living underwater, which include, but are not limited to, always needing to keep yourself breathing, keeping your shelter intact, and ensuring you don't become shark food.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/subnautica-abyss-gazes-back/">Subnautica</a> offered players something entirely new with its alien aquatic setting, Anchor keeps its setting grounded (and wet) with its own version of Earth's oceans. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of marine life, beyond predators like sharks, play a role in Anchor when it does arrive at some point in the future.</p>



<p>For now, the game is set to arrive on PC, with no word of a potential console release in the future. Though that can always change. Hopefully, we'll hear more about when Anchor is due to arrive soon, or at least get a chance to play it at an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest</a> event or something similar.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-dev-boss-fight-shut-down-by-netflix.1336069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed down&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment, just three years or so after acquiring the developer.</p>

<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, as well as Boss Fight CEO David Rippy, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-rippy-1b16871_hi-everyone-well-word-has-gotten-around-activity-7387225251513827328-E979/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the studio's closure via his LinkedIn account over the weekend, describing news of the developer's shutdown as "rough".</p>

<p>Netflix's decision to shut down Boss Fight might seem a little strange given that it's only been three years <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow">since the studio was acquired</a>. Not only that, but, as Rippy says in his post, the studio had a bona fide hit on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, which "hit #1 in 26 countries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=M-oDFlDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=DtZJaOmR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment has been shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither Netflix nor Boss Fight gave an official reason for the studio's closure, but Game Developer "understands" that it's all down to new Netflix games president Alain Tascan, who took over from Mike Verdu <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>.</p>

<p>Per Game Developer, Tascan's goal with Netflix's gaming division is to focus things more on "party games, children's titles, and narrative experiences" (that's Game Developer's wording, not Tascan's), and Boss Fight's shutdown is a direct result of that paradigm shift.</p>

<p>Despite Boss Fight's shutdown,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>will apparently still receive support from Netflix, so if you're a fan of the game, you don't need to worry about it going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is the second studio Netlfix has (apparently) closed down in the last twelve months or so; last October, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">was reported</a> that the streaming giant had shuttered its all-star Team Blue development outfit, which counted&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>alumni among its number.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=py8ykfwC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=ngzK00St 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix also shut down Team Blue, which boasted the involvement of alumni from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these shutdowns, Netflix is going all-in on gaming adaptations, with its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series already having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">renewed for a second season</a> and its long-gestating&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">finally going ahead</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rippy and his fellow Boss Fight alumni do after the shutdown of the studio, but we may not hear from them for a while, if Rippy's words are to be believed; he says he and his co-executives will "take a little breather" before moving on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfinder-afterlight-voice-cast-gains-iconic-baldurs-gate-3-actor.1336063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming CRPG <i>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</i>has gained a brand new voice cast member in the form of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>alumnus Neil Newbon, whose name you'll probably already have seen if you're following the project.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, Newbon will be joining&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>to voice Preach, who'll serve as one of your companions in the upcoming RPG. Preach is a Shirren who's aiming to become a galaxy-renowned High Priest, but it'll be up to you whether or not he succeeds.</p>

<p>Newbon is also serving as the voice director for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>; he's heading up a cast that also includes legends like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Carolina Ravassa,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>'s Melissa Medina, and long-time voice acting veteran Fred Tatasciore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=kmReiZ0g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=HiP9MpwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Voice director Neil Newbon will be pulling double duty as a voice actor in&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>made its debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-campaign-charges-kickstarter-raising-over-400k" rel="nofollow">via Kickstarter earlier this month</a>, raising over $400,000 in very short order indeed. The game has since passed the $600,000 mark, and it's still got twelve days to go, so there's every chance it'll soar to even greater heights in the next few days.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game only has one more stretch goal to meet, which will happen if the campaign reaches $700,000 (a feat that's looking increasingly likely given how much has already been raised).</p>

<p>That goal will add full voice acting to the game; in the words of developer Epictellers, that means "every aspect of the game, every NPC, every companion bark, every narrative moment, [will be] fully voiced".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the studio manages to reach its final stretch goal, but things are looking pretty bright for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, so I wouldn't be surprised if more goals are added after the fact.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, it's a CRPG based on Paizo's popular tabletop RPG (specifically, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow">second edition version</a> of said game). It'll see players investigating the disappearance of a spaceship captain, during the course of which the fate of the galaxy will hang in the balance.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's due to hit Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> in the second quarter of next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727">PlayStation 2 turned 25 years old this week</a>. I’m sorry if you suddenly feel very old. But don’t worry, I feel old, too! Anyway, to celebrate the milestone, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared some data about the console, including its best-selling games as well as the home console’s most-purchased accessory.</p> <p>On October 26, 2000, Sony launched the PS2 in North America, and it quickly became one of the most successful video game console releases in history. In the United States alone, the console would go on to sell over 45 million units, and globally it has shipped 160 million, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles">making it the best-selling console ever</a>. (Though the Nintendo Switch will likely overtake it in the near future.) Over the course of the console’s lifecycle, thousands of PlayStation 2 games were released for it. Not all of them were great, but the machine does still indeed boast one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-ps2-games-rare-playstation-console-sony-retro-1790020087">best console game libraries around</a>.</p>

 <p>To celebrate the console’s 25th birthday in America, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m44bjwl5n22h">Piscatella posted some fun stats about the PS2 on social media</a>. Did you know that the 8mb memory card was the PS2’s most sold accessory with a 61-percent attach rate? Overall, 147 million accessories were sold in the United States for the PS2. Wowza. And for those curious, here are the top 20 best-selling PlayStation 2 games of all time based on unit sales.</p> <p><strong>US Top 20 All-Time Best-Selling PS2 Games (Jan 1999 – Sep 2025)&nbsp;</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto III&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2005</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero II&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2004</em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2006</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2007</em></li> <li><em>Jampack Series: PlayStation 2</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2003</em></li> <li><em>Need for Speed: Underground&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li> <li><em>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</em></li> <li><em>Final Fantasy X</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 4: The Real Driving Simulator</em></li> <li><em>God of War</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor: Frontline</em></li> </ol> <p>While I expected the <em>GTA</em> games to top the chart, I was surprised to see <em>Medal of Honor: Frontline, Final Fantasy X,</em> and <em>God of War</em> crack the list, too. Also, wow, EA really was a force to be reckoned with back then, huh? What a different time for video games. Then again, <em>GTA</em> leading the pack hasn’t changed much in 2025, so I guess the more things change…</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many who’ve already picked up a copy of RV There Yet?, you’ve contributed to the game’s incredible early success, which has seen RV There Yet? hit 1.3 million copies sold on Steam—and counting.</p>



<p>We’ve waxed lyrical about this year’s big indie breakouts: Schedule 1, REPO, PEAK, and Ball X Pit. It’s time to add another one to the growing list, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> is already going above and beyond ‘overnight sensation’ status.</p>

<p>RV There Yet? is the manic game where you need to escape Route 65, and do so with the help of your trusty RV. You can do so with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-can-play-rv-there-yet-max-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few players</a>, and its concept and stylings lean somewhat toward PEAK.</p>



<p>This is a unique game, though, let’s not get this twisted. It has a clear identity and a wacky brand of violence, miscommunication, and a party-heavy flavor. This is why RV There Yet? has sold <strong>1,288,515 copies in under seven days on Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>The sales figure was revealed by Jace Varlet, the community manager for Nuggets Entertainment, in a YouTube video on the game’s initial progress and success. It’s clear that the game is selling unbelievably well—thanks to its affordable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-cost-free-to-play-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price tag</a>—and it seems like a matter of time before new sales milestones are hit, very quickly.</p>

You can play solo or in a group of up to 6 people, but for each zombie you take down, you'll be closer to leveling up and gaining mastery of special weapons, perks, and more. Complete quests, roll spins for perks, and customize your character to be the ultimate zombie-slaying machine. So, whether you're jumping into specific maps like the school or sewer, taking on a raid, or completing campaign mode, here are codes for Hunty Zombie that will give you a boost when tackling the undead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Hunty Zombie Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You need to be Level 5 before you can use codes. But once you've hit that level, here are the codes you can redeem:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Reaper</strong> - 15x Lucky Weapon Spin </li><li><strong>RIP67</strong> - 200,000 Coins</li><li><strong>ScytheRP</strong> - 10x Traits</li><li><strong>NEWBOSSRAID123</strong> - 15x Lucky Perk Spin</li><li><strong>HZ4EVER</strong> - 300,000 Coins</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Use Hunty Zombie Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem codes, launch the Hunty Zombie Roblox experience. When you're in the main lobby, follow these steps to get your goodies:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Locate the codes menu on the right side of the screen. It's the icon of the open book at the top of the submenus. </li><li>Copy the code from this article and then paste it into the bar that says "enter code here..."</li><li>Click confirm and receive your rewards!</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Hunty ZombieCodes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These codes are no longer valid:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Halloween</strong> -  300,000 Coins </li><li><strong>SpinalBlade</strong> - 10 Weapon Lucky Spins</li><li><strong>NewSwordHW</strong> - 10x Traits</li><li><strong>SIRJACKY</strong> - 10x Perk Lucky Spins</li><li><strong>SpookyPet</strong> - 150,000 Coin </li><li><strong>hwticket</strong> - 5x Halloween Tickets</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Hunty Zombie Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Codes for Roblox experiences are usually case-sensitive, so the best way to ensure you've got a working code is to directly copy it from this article. We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double-check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is the Next Hunty Zombie Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunty Zombie's neweest update launched on Friday, 24th October. A new Grim Repear raid was introduced, along with new weapons that you can get via the Grim Repear raid shop, a new pet that only has a 2% chance of dropping from the boss, and plenty of balance changes and bug fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

It seems like a safe bet that there will eventually be another God of War game, and if there is, Christopher Judge wants it to take place in Egypt.</p><p>Judge--who first rose to fame for starring in Stargate SG-1 as Teal'c--has voiced Kratos since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a> in 2018. The original games set Kratos against the Greek pantheon of gods, while the last two games centered on the Norse gods. For a new title, Judge recently disclosed that he would like to return to some of the Egyptian mythology from Stargate.</p><p>"Because I became best known as Teal'c from Stargate, to go to Egypt would be a completion of my circle," said Judge during his recent appearance at MCM London Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>).

<p>"The Earth Directorate found a flaw in you! Consumerism," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1ofs8jr/premium_edition_flaw_lol/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the screenshot disenchantor shared reads</a>. "You're the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you're more interested in buying the next big thing than financial planning."</p><p>Flaws are effects in The Outer Worlds that either provide buffs, like increasing attack damage, or are detrimental, such as reducing energy recharge rate. The consumerism flaw has a permanent positive and negative effect: it decreases vendor prices by 15% while decreasing your items' sale value to vendors by 10%.</p><p>There's another, unrelated flaw that Redditors have found. Let's say you're the impatient gamer, the one that skips the dialogue and cutscenes to get to the action. If that's you, then, like Redditor Hefty-Paramedic1934 discovered, you could receive the "Foot-In-Mouth Syndrome" flaw, which increases the experience you earn by 15% but chooses all your dialogue for you.</p><p>"You've been racing through conversations and seem to hate the idea of having to talk with others," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the pop-up reads in Hefty-Paramedic1934's screenshot</a>. "Your choices in conversations are now randomly picked for you after a few seconds, but you gain a bonus to all experience earned."</p><p>And as <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-obsidian-flaws-consumerism-skip-dialogue-2000639250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by Kotaku</a>, Redditor chunky_jalapeno uncovered yet another flaw in the game: Easily Distracted, which appears to trigger when you spend your skill points across the skill tree. It gives you one additional skill point per level but forces you to allocate them to the skills you haven't already invested in.</p><p>"Your skills are erratic to say the least, but a jack of all trades is oftentimes better than a master of one," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1ogm9cd/is_this_a_good_flaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the in-game message in chunky_jalapeno's sreenshot reads</a>. "You can raise more skills faster, though it'll be harder to ever maximize any particular one."</p><p>It seems as though as Obsidian Entertainment has buffs and debuffs ready for all the ways you could play--or try to skip--parts of its space-RPG. Be careful what you do.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. We gave it an 8/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/" data-ref-id="1900-6418428">our The Outer Worlds 2 review</a>, with critic Steve Watts saying it "feels like the series coming into its own, carried by flexible combat options and great role-playing progression."</p>

			<p>A new Unreal Engine 5 feature pushed to the engine's main development branch last week could pave the way for significant Lumen performance improvements across the board and for the lighting technology to be implemented in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://x.com/DylserX"> tech artist Dylan Browne on X</a>, Lumen Irradiance Cache, a probe-based Lumen mode for lower-end devices, is now available in the Epic engine. Compared to the default Hardware Lumen, the new mode features less occlusion detail and worse reflections, but it's still a good compromise compared to having no Lumen at all, judging from the comparison video below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lumen Irradiance Cache | New Probe Based Lumen For Lower End | Unreal Engine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkLmUPJvhsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As the Unreal Engine 5 Lumen Irradiance Cache is still in a very early state, it is difficult to say how much low-power devices will benefit from it. However, things are looking quite promising already. According to a now-removed GitHub commit, which was captured before removal and shared on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-ps5-power-saver-mode-tested-a-green-initiative-next-gen-handheld-teaser-or-both.1335199/#post-146877265">ResetERA forums</a>, Lumen Radiance Cache speeds up the Lumen gather stage by 2.5 times for an overall Lumen Scene speedup of 1.5.</p>



<p>This lighter version of Lumen could finally make Unreal Engine 5’s signature lighting viable on lower-power hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, even if in a limited form. At this time, games powered by the engine released on the new generation Nintendo console, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, don't feature Lumen, most likely because <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/">the console's CPU&nbsp;can't run games with such demanding features at an acceptable performance level.</a></p>



<p>As even Fortnite doesn't run with Lumen and Nanite on the Nintendo Switch 2, it's clear that dedicated work had to be made on the engine for the console to support these hallmark features, which seems to be already happening with the implementation of this new Lumen option. Hopefully, it won't take long for developers to take advantage of it and bring Switch 2 ports closer to the other console versions in terms of visual fidelity.</p>

            <p>Co-operative starship mishap sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-space">Jump Space</a> just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/543372164837935536">the first major update</a> of its early access phase, bringing both functional capitalism and a surprisingly enjoyable trio of melee weapons. The former takes the shape of newly opened item shops at your home base, giving you a chance to stock up on guns, repair kits, or artifact buffs before shipping out on a mission. And, having thwacked a few bots with the latter, I’m liking how worthy they are of a precious weapon slot, even in a game previously set up entirely for gunplay.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Besides their generous impact damage, the newly added wrench, crowbar, and sci-fi Heatblade sword can – with a timely block – deflect laser blasts back at the mechanoid dickhead who fired them. Yes, Jump Space now has parrying, which I’m aware in 2025 is the action game equivalent of saying <em>wow, this strategy game’s got deckbuilding in it</em>. But I still think these three hittin' sticks are good additions, for two reasons: one, they add a needed extra dimension to Jump Space’s otherwise simplistic shooting, and two, it’s simply a right old laugh to perform laser-bouncing ninja nonsense with what is outwardly a completely mundane pipe wrench.</p>
<p>Basically: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crsO5CO3KTA">Oh, good. Why that’s very good. Yes, I like that.</a></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Keepsake Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shops aren’t as interesting, though I imagine the ability to quickly tool back up with basic guns might take some sting out of losing your upgraded arsenal in a failed run. Speaking of which, the patch notes also share some of Keepsake Games' thinking on equipment permanence: in short, it doesn’t sound like they’re adding the (apparently much-requested) option to stash favourite guns for safekeeping, though the plan is to make higher-tier loot spawns more common. "This will make good weapons frequent enough that hugging your MK3 for dear life won't be players’ top priority," the post explains.</p><p>Back in the present, this update also adds a handful of mission modifiers, potentially throwing in yet more baddie spaceships to dogfight or extra salvaging opportunities, as well as a little Hallowe'en event involving the fetch-questing of pumpkins. Your reward? Another pumpkin, specifically one to wear on your head. It presumably still protects you against the vacuum of space, unlike the ones they have in Tesco.</p>
<p>Jump Space still has a lot of early access jumping to do. Nothing here fixes its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spark-of-co-op-magic-keeps-jump-space-flying-though-early-access-turbulence">biggest issue of mission and environment repetition</a>, which will need solving if it’s to have real legs. This patch feels like a pretty good enough start, though.</p>

              <p>When you get invited to an exclusive event, usually you’re the one who’s expected to come bearing gifts. But with Costco’s invitation to join their Gold Star club for just $65, which gets you a year of access to incredible savings across all of their huge array of departments, you’re the one receiving the gift in the form of a $40 gift card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">The invitation is waiting for you now at StackSocial.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If your one-stop shopping ambitions are even greater, so are the rewards. <strong>StackSocial is offering a year’s membership to Costco’s Executive Gold Star club, where you get all of the access and benefits of Gold Star membership plus a 2% annual reward on all of your purchases, for just $130</strong>.

<h2>Members Only</h2>
<p>A membership is the only way to get in the door at any of Costco’s 635 locations nationwide, but when the membership fee is marked down so significantly and delivered with a gift card to be used on your first shopping trip, it’s more than worth it. Whether you go in person or shop online, Costco is the ultimate in one-stop shopping, with everything from fresh groceries, meat, and fish to clothes for men, women, and kids, with literally hundreds of other goods and services in between.</p>
<p>A trip to Costco can replace your trips to the grocery store, big-box electronics store, hardware store, bakery, liquor store, drugstore, and more. Then, of course, there is the legendary Costco food court, where the $1.50 all-beef hot dog and 20 oz drink deal has not changed price in years. And before you gas up the car for your Costco trip, remember that Costco membership also gets you access to the dramatically reduced gas prices at Costco’s own pumps.</p>



<h2>More Than Merchandise</h2>
<p>Costco’s deals on merchandise and groceries are amazing, but so are their deals on services you wouldn’t normally associate with a shopping run. Costco’s automotive department has outstanding deals on tires and other services that are performed on-site, and there are also optometry and prescription departments ready to provide important personal health services at lower prices. Travel deals, check printing, free roadside assistance, auto insurance, water delivery — it’s no exaggeration to say that Costco has virtually any and everything you can think of.</p>
<p>But the only way to get in on all of these goods and services at fantastic prices is by having a membership. StackSocial’s deals for new members on a year of Gold Star membership for $65 or a year of Executive Gold Star membership for $130 await, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">as do the $40 (Gold Star) or $65 (Executive Gold Star) gift cards that automatically recoup much your first year’s fee.</a></p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have just revealed that Battlefield Redsec - the game's free-to-play Battle Royale mode - will be available tomorrow on the 28th October.</p>
<p>This announcement came out of nowhere, with a post made across official Battlefield social media accounts. This announcement came alongside a scheduled YouTube launch trailer reveal for Redsec, which will go live at 2PM BST / 3PM CST / 10AM EST / 7AM PST.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-battlefield-redsec-could-shadowdrop-as-soon-as-next-week-dataminers-claim">The sudden news comes soon after dataminers claimed last weekend that the battle royale mode could be imminently dropped</a>. It seems the general audience will have little lead up to the battle royale mode, and instead will have to experience the whole thing fresh together starting tomorrow. Certainly a bold way to drum up excitement around a much-anticipated game mode.</p>

<p>EA has yet to state officially what will be in the Redsec Battle Royale mode, how large the map will be, or the finer details on how it'll play compared to some of its major competitors. However, leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">did peel back the curtain on this battle royale mode several months </a><a href="http://ago.it/">ago.</a> It is of course worth noting that time has passed since this testing period, and leaked details may have changed significantly during that time.</p><p>This shadow drop comes while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> continues its streak of popularity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">One of the best performing Battlefield's ever</a> so far, the game recently gave players a look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-has-its-season-one-trailer-showing-new-weapons-maps-and-a-tactical-game-mode">upcoming Season One update</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">a massive update that'll fix one of the game's biggest ongoing problems</a>.</p>

		<p>Two Point Studios has announced that the next DLC for Two Point Museum will give players a new wildlife wing with Zooseum. Zooseum is less about putting animals on as exhibits but more on rescuing them, raising them, healing their issues, and working to rewild them. Much like what many modern zoos do. That also makes one wonder if this is a possible glimpse of a future Two Point Zoo game.</p>

<p>Aside from the short teaser trailer, there has been no further details about Two Point Museum’s Zooseum. Content and a release date will be announced later on, though a specific timeframe has not been given. Two Point Museum is launching on Nintendo Switch 2 tomorrow, and handily we have a review of it.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/27/two-point-museum-switch-2-review/">Two Point Museum Switch 2 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our review, Stefan said, <em>“Two Point Museum on Switch 2 is a fairly straightforward port to Nintendo’s latest console. The minor glitches and crashes should be ironed out quickly, but it’s clear that the game simulation does hit the limits of the Switch 2’s CPU and larger museums do drop the frame rate. Still, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable and endlessly quirky management sim that’s an easy recommendation for fans of the genre and this series in particular. If you can’t accept a few compromises, the other platforms are ready and waiting.”</em></p>
