            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From Software and Bandai Namco have released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>story trailer that sets up the narrative for the upcoming DLC expansion.</p>

<p>As the trailer begins, a voiceover speaks about "the seduction and the betrayal" that gave rise to both Gold and Shadow. It's all preceded by a mention of "Miquella the Kind", the central figure around which&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>will seemingly revolve.</p>

<p>Following this introduction, we hear about a "war unseen" as giant flame constructs march across a city. The voiceover describes the war as "a purge without grace or honor", led by "the tyranny of Messmer's flame".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=GXpXyTi3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=UGMCgfNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Messmer will play an important role in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We then hear that Kindly Miquella has "abandon[ed] everything" as we see a series of marks that look a lot like one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Great Runes. Since these are usually held by gods and demigods, we can perhaps infer that this is Miquella's Great Rune.</p>

<p>Miquella has seemingly stripped himself of his "Golden flesh" and "even his fate" in order to venture into the Land of Shadow, although we're still not sure exactly what he's doing there.</p>

<p>The voiceover says that "we", presumably referring to the group of Tarnished we see in the trailer, "are not deterred". It seems, then, that you'll be following in Miquella's footsteps as he roams the Land of Shadow, and you'll presumably find out what happened to the realm along the way.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>story trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24161559/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-story-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With only a month until release day, there’s a new story trailer for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree, </em>and the <em>Elden Ring</em> lore hounds have their work cut out for them.</p><div><p>FromSoftware has been slowly teasing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and its story beats ever since the gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990947/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-trailer">was released back in February</a>. All we knew then was the DLC would take place in the Land of Shadow and feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158964/fromsoftware-just-debuted-their-bloodiest-monster-yet">a bunch of new horrors</a> straight from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls">slightly warped imagination of game director Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>.</p></div><p>This new Land of Shadow was connected somehow to Miquella — the dude in the egg with the withered arm. The trailer mentions him prominently, giving the impression we’ll learn more about him, his connection to the Land of Shadow, and what events led him to abandon the place to its fiery fate. </p><p>Speaking of fiery fate, the trailer also spends its short runtime on Messmer, the red-haired hottie with the snakes who seems like he’ll be the DLC’s final boss. (Although you never can tell with FromSoftware games. Once you think you’ve beaten the final boss, some cosmic entity arrives and blows up your last flask of healing.) Messmer is apparently responsible for the great purge of the Land of Shadow, and I’m curious to know why. </p><p>The story trailer was short and light and cryptic, as FromSoftware stories tend to be. I’m looking forward to the <em>hours</em> of YouTube deep dives I’ll digest as creators (shout out to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FIronPineapple">Iron Pineapple</a>) extrapolate the deepest of lore from the smallest of moments. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> launches on June 21st on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> is out now, and on PC, it’s a demanding but visually dazzling experience if you’ve got the hardware (check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessio’s review of the game running on an RTX 4090 here</a>), but what about consoles? Before launch, it was revealed that Hellblade II would only have a single 30fps visual mode on Xbox Series X/S, but at least that narrow focus would mean the game would consistently nail that 30fps, right? Well, about that… the folks at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> have taken the Xbox versions of Hellblade II for a spin, and the results aren’t quite as solid as you might hope. Check out the full analysis below if you have around 15 minutes to spare, or scroll on down for our rundown of the salient points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hellblade 2 | Xbox Series S/X - PC  | Graphics Comparison | Analista De Bits" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNwO6WZD0cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the above analysis, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II runs at a dynamic 2560x1070p with an average res of around 2304x963p on Xbox Series X and a dynamic 1920x803p with an average of 1472x615p on Xbox Series S (the resolutions are rather wonky due to the game running in “cinematic” 2.39:1 widescreen mode with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen). In terms of visual quality, the Series X looks very similar to the PC on higher settings, while the Series S is a bit lower quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither the Xbox Series X or S seems to be able to maintain a consistent 30fps. While both hit 30fps perhaps 80 percent of the time, dips look to be common during more visually lush and action-packed scenes. The Xbox Series X can drop into the mid-20fps range, and the Xbox Series S can plunge all the way down to the low 20s. Oddly, the two systems seem to struggle at slightly different points, perhaps tied to how each system handles its dynamic resolution.</p>
<p>At least for now, it seems like Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II may be the game that’s just a bit too pretty for the Xbox Series X/S. Here’s hoping a bit more optimization can be brought to the table in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is available now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

  <p id="8WR4Aw">FromSoftware released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> expansion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079297/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-release-date-editions-messmer-impaler"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> on Tuesday, giving fans of the open-world fantasy adventure a fresh look at the DLC’s story. That includes new details on its imposing new villain, Messmer the Impaler, a powerful demigod who appears to have a strong connection to characters from the original <em>Elden Ring</em> story.</p>
<p id="tDgdhG"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s new trailer also hints at what sent the demigod <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131400/elden-ring-dlc-miquella-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Miquella</a> to a new land, one that was crushed under the tyranny of Messmer’s flame, and for which Miquella sacrificed himself. The trailer ends with the followers of Miquella joining forces and beckoning new warriors to join them on their journey to depose Messmer and his burning legions.</p>
<p id="tHLtXA">Our latest look at <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is something we’ve come to expect from FromSoft: a CG trailer that dives deeper into the opaque lore of <em>Elden Ring</em> and doesn’t offer anything in the way of new gameplay. But for students of <em>Elden Ring</em> myth, it’s a rich vein of information about characters and their allegiances in this complicated family story.</p>
<p id="TMAuFL"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23991138/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-release-date-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> will send players to an unexplored region known as the Land of Shadow, just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">a short egg ride from Mohgwyn Palace</a>. There, in a landmass roughly the size of the game’s Limgrave region, they’ll explore the dark realm and follow in the footsteps of the mysterious Empyrean Miquella.</p>
<p id="8UmUEq"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will be released on June 21. The expansion is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via Steam, just like the original <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>A new trailer has been published online ahead of Summer Games Fest, showcasing around one minute of stunning vistas and sumptuous visuals from Delta Force: Hawk Ops. This is a game that’s fast entering mythical status, as despite a few teaser sequences surfacing online and the developer – TiMi Studio – hyping the game up, we’re yet to see tangible evidence that it’s a real thing that we’ll be able to play any time soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops looks like a fever dream for a Battlefield fan. It boasts large-scale combat fused with vehicular warfare, destructible environments, and real-world, gritty gunplay reminiscent of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield, which were often considered the peak of the franchise. In one recent Delta Force trailer, we looked at some concerning content, such as a ‘specialist-based’ operating system and some bizarre, out-of-place in-game abilities bordering on the ‘basically out of place’ kind of level.</p>



<p>In the most recent Delta Force: Hawk Ops trailer, we’re given a one-minute-long look at some in-game locales, as well as a slew of weapons. The short video shows some tasty lighting elements and some dynamic weather effects, but aside from the character doing the ‘super slow trailer walk’ through what might be a series of multiplayer maps, there isn’t much to take away:</p>

<p>It looks good, but it’s hard to see it being anything more than a Battlefield clone at the moment. Even some of the naming conventions for the multiplayer modes (‘Hazard Operations’) are a bit close to the line. On June 7, we’ll get a deeper look at Delta Force: Hawk Ops as the game gets <strong>yet another trailer </strong>at Summer Game Fest.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Official Switch Overview Trailer</p>

<p>The original Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/1900-6110235/" data-ref-id="1900-6110235">glowing praise even back in 2004</a>. This enhanced HD remaster on Switch can be bought digitally and physically for $60.</p><p>You can see a few review scores for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024). For more reviews, be sure to visit GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024)</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> Nintendo Switch</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Intelligent Systems/Nintendo</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 23, 2024</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $60</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 9/10</h2><p>"The Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive way to play the best turn-based RPG starring Mario. More of an enhanced HD remaster than a full-fledged remake, The Thousand-Year Door has small yet meaningful quality-of-life features that ease some of the bloat from the original GameCube version. The catchy remixed soundtrack wonderfully complements the thoroughly entertaining and dynamic turn-based battle system. Throw in a stellar cast of characters and consistently playful writing, and The Thousand-Year Door has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG. Well, it always had them, but now they are blended a bit better." -- <em>Steven Petite </em>[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" data-ref-id="1900-6418230">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Digital Trends -- 9/10</h2><p>"If you were hoping that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed. Thankfully, The Thousand-Year Door still holds up 20 years after release, thanks to some hilarious dialogue, timeless visuals, and an approachable RPG battle system." -- <em>Tomas Franzese</em> [<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Shack News -- 9/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door might be ever so slightly dated in its first two chapters and its insistence on loading every area with too many enemies. Its bizarre cast, excellent writing, and inventive battles mean it earns its reputation as one of the best and most inventive RPGs, though, and it’s just as fresh and imaginative now as it ever was." -- <em>Josh Broadwell</em> [<a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/139935/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-review-score" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>TheGamer -- 8/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door will probably be the last Mario game to release (solely) on the Switch. While Wonder will take the plaudits, porting this cult classic means that a new generation of players can experience it. New fans will have a ball, laughing along with Mario &amp; co., even if their experience will be slightly marred by the backtracking and pacing. Old fans will enjoy the quality of life improvements and some new additions. Whether you’re a Paper Mario veteran or this is your first time entering his origami world, this is the definitive way to experience The Thousand-Year Door." -- <em>Ben Sledge</em> [<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Wccftech -- 8/10</h2><p>"While I may have come off somewhat critical of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in this review, there’s still an undeniable richness and depth to its world that no other game in the series has quite managed to achieve. Rogueport, with its varied cast of ne’er-do-wells and weirdos and countless secrets, is still one of my favorite locales I’ve ever visited with Nintendo’s plumber. Even with its minor streamlining, the new TTYD still serves up a solid 25-hour story with plenty of side content to clean up, including perhaps some small new post-game treats. This papery adventure definitely isn’t a lightweight." -- <em>Nathan Birch</em> [<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Jeuxvideo.com -- 7.5/10</h2><p>"This remastered version maintains the excellence of its pen with a cast of characters each as striking as the next with a combat system that has already proven itself. The modernized artistic direction works wonders, both visually and aurally. But form is not everything. The structure of the game can quickly weigh on anyone who is allergic to the multiple forced back and forth, especially since the features to relieve this archaic architecture are too little impactful to relieve its heaviness." -- <em>Charlanmhg</em> [<a href="https://www.jeuxvideo.com/test/1886203/c-est-l-un-des-meilleurs-jeux-video-mario-de-son-genre-et-il-arrive-sur-nintendo-switch-20-ans-apres-paper-mario-la-porte-millenaire-est-il-toujours-indemodable.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/theres-a-new-destiny-2-inventory-manager-in-town-and-its-a-doozy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=theres-a-new-destiny-2-inventory-manager-in-town-and-its-a-doozy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At the risk of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ive-been-playing-destiny-2-wrong-for-nearly-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing <em>Destiny 2</em> incorrectly</a>, the odds are good that you, too, use a third-party <em>Destiny</em> inventory manager of some sort to move items around via your browser, phone, or some other digital implement. Now, though, there’s a new tool at your disposal, known as Deepsight.gg.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">The creator of Deepsight.gg, known under their Reddit username ChiriVulpes, posted about the inventory manager’s release <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cw25ay/ive_been_working_on_an_item_manager_since_season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the <em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a>, where they explained what makes this tool such a big deal. For one, it looks positively <em>snazzy</em>, as it follows the visual cues of the game itself, which features striking, easy-to-read UI across the board. Anyone interested in checking out Deepsight.gg can now do so and <a href="https://deepsight.gg/weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin managing their <em>Destiny 2</em> inventory right away</a>, but the really interesting bit is that this toolkit can do <em>way</em> more than just that.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-deepsight-gg-is-now-out-with-plenty-of-updates-in-the-pipeline" data-injectable="false">Deepsight.gg is now out, with plenty of updates in the pipeline</h2> <p data-characters="111" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">As ChiriVulpes explains, Deepsight.gg’s general feature list at the time of its release is the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Destiny 2</em>-inspired UI across the board</li> <li>basic item management functionality</li> <li>extremely granular sorting systems</li> <li>filtering via input, with highlighting and buttons suggesting additional options</li> <li>full access to the game’s Collections UI</li> <li>access to item drop sources</li> <li>item and Perk wishlisting</li> <li>full player overview for all three <em>Destiny 2</em> characters</li> <li>comprehensive tooltips providing more access to information than other item managers do</li> <li>“spying” on other Guardians’ inventories and gear</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">And loads more, of course. All in all, then, Deepsight.gg does appear to be a powerful substitute to the widely acclaimed and almost universally used <a href="https://destinyitemmanager.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny Item Manager</a> (DIM, for short), but for a single issue: Deepsight.gg does not support custom loadouts just yet. ChiriVulpes appears not to have been aware of how many people used DIM’s loadout functionality – which can overwrite the in-game loadouts on the fly – and they’ve now pivoted to include loadouts as soon as possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">As per <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cw25ay/ive_been_working_on_an_item_manager_since_season/l4tz1dz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChiriVulpes’ later comment on Reddit</a>, the priority list for Deepsight.gg is simple:</p> <figure data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">Good stuff all around, then. Deepsight.gg is already remarkably powerful and will deliver on all the usual item management fronts (and then some), but it goes without saying that many people simply won’t move on from DIM no matter what, given how emblematic the tool has become over the years. Still, competition is good, and Deepsight.gg is an excellent competitor that’s only going to get better as ChiriVulpes continues working on it.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">It’s going to be particularly interesting to see how DIM, Deepsight.gg, BrayTech, and all the other third-party <em>Destiny 2</em> tools handle <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-outlines-the-final-shapes-new-weapon-enhancement-feature-and-its-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming weapon enhancement features</a>, as Bungie appears to be adding a whole new layer of complexity to how the game’s weapons are handled in the backend. Still, it’s a good problem to have, and the sort of stuff that will be widely discussed in the community when the time comes.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">In other related news, I’m thrilled to report that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things have settled down in the <em>Destiny 2</em> community</a> almost across the board, as we approach the release window of <em>The Final Shape</em>. <em>Lightfall</em> didn’t burn through <em>all</em> of the community’s goodwill after all, I suppose!</p>

FromSoftware has released a brand new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
The trailer lasts three minutes and provides a fresh look at the story, which for the most part has remained under wraps until now despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-analysed">analysis and speculation on previous trailers</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the trailer in full below.

<p>So what do we see?</p>
<p>"Miquella the kind spoke of the beginning," the narration begins. "The seduction and the betrayal. An affair from which gold arose. And so too was shadow born." That certainly seems to encapsulate the backdrop of the narrative, which is spoken along with images of Miquella walking up bloody steps towards an archway of bloodied bodies, presumably awakening from his slumber.</p>

<p>We witness a war of flames, with plenty of those caged fiery giants from the previous trailer. "A purge without grace or honour, the tyranny of Messmer's flame," says the narration as the big bad presides over the battle. We see another previously seen boss too as eventually the camera pans upwards from the battle in the shadow of the golden erdtree. It seems clear that the golden Miquella and the flaming Messmer are at odds.</p>

<p>Repeatedly we see this golden symbol, presumably marks left by Miquella, in various environments. Is this a new type of site of grace, or just an indicator of our goal?</p>

<p>The final shot sees the camera pan backwards to reveal a number of characters stood at one of these symbols, the golden erdtree in the background. Are these characters we'll meet along the journey as we follow in Miquella's footsteps? And, in typical Souls fashion, are they not to be trusted? "We choose to follow," speaks the narration. "Will you walk with us?"</p>

<p>
We don't have long to decide now as Shadow of the Erdtree will release next month on 21st June across all platforms and will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">FromSoftware's "largest expansion" ever</a>. It will also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-elden-rings-sole-dlc-but-may-not-be-the-series-end">the sole DLC, but maybe not the end of the series</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the lead up to this new story trailer, the studio has released artwork of some new enemies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reveals-new-elden-ring-enemy-with-bloodborne-esque-design">Bloodborne-esque enemy with a bulbous golden head</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-features-fearsome-foes-of-unfathomable-power-and-heres-one-of-them">masked creature some have likened to a uterus</a>.

			<p>A new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree trailer was released online today, providing a new quick look at the highly anticipated expansion.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which can be watched below, focuses on the expansion's story, which takes place in the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot. Guided by the Empyrean Miquella, players will discover the dark secrets of the world in this land and meet others who follow in Miquella's footsteps with ulterior motives.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With its new locations to explore and new enemies to defeat while taking advantage of new mechanics and weapons, the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is set to improve the Elden Ring experience considerably, which was already excellent to begin with, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One on June 21st.</p>

The RPG follows Mario and an eclectic group of pals as they hunt for stars on a treasure map to unlock the secret behind the titular Thousand-Year Door. Turn-based combat has you hitting buttons in real-time to make attacks and other techniques more effective, and a badge system lets you experiment with different strategies. Another highlight is the writing, which isn’t afraid to be both funny <em>and</em> weird. And after years of gimmick-driven sequels, the lost GameCube gem offers a purer, more old-school RPG alternative to the likes of <em>Paper Mario: Color Splash </em>and <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>. </p><p>At the time of this writing, the new release of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> has an 89 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Metacritic</a></span>, and it doesn’t appear to have cut any of the story beats or dialogue that has stuck with fans for decades. But it also doesn’t appear to have added much in the way of new content, making it feel like more of a straight HD port. “<em>The Thousand-Year Door </em>has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG,” wrote  Steven Petite for <em>GameSpot</em>, while at <em>Nintendo Life</em> Alana Hagues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> that the remaster falls slightly short of last year’s <em>Super Mario RPG </em>when it comes to adding additional gameplay wrinkles. </p><p>Here’s a round-up of what others are saying about <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.</em></p><hr><h3 id="h36084"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Rogueport and its surrounding areas are bursting with personality thanks to writing that’s just as sharp and funny today as it was in 2004.

A few lines of dark humor actually made my mouth drop, and it’s hard to believe that the words of a Bob-omb with a steering wheel attached to his back got to me more than any game in a long time.

The fact that this game is returning on its 20th anniversary, hot off the heels of a remake of the similarly idiosyncratic and beloved <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, hearkens back to a time when a big Mario game could be for a specific kind of person, and not necessarily for everyone. </p></blockquote><h3 id="h36087"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> If you were hoping that <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed.

While it’s a bit of a bummer that Nintendo’s 2024 game lineup is mostly comprised of remakes, I’m glad Nintendo is giving <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> a second shot at life.

It’s giving<em> Majora’s Mask</em>, and the fact that it doesn’t end with the boss battle – the twist here is great – gives it life and vibrancy, despite the dim corridors you explore. The platforming puzzles are clever, but it’s all over too quick. After spending such a long time in the wrestling ring, I was excited to get back to the game proper, and felt shortchanged.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h36090"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Engadget</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s too bad Nintendo had to lower the frame rate down to 30fps from the Gamecube’s silky smooth 60fps, but it’s not the end of the world. If you can enjoy some of the greatest games ever made in 30fps, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>The Thousand Year Door</em> is no different. The remake also adds enough new graphical elements to make it look better than the original.

But where other entries have been let down by their occasionally gimmicky gameplay, <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>’s RPG mechanics remain pleasingly robust and consistently engaging, with players able to battle foes alongside their companions in turn-based battles, and level up their stats upon defeating enough of them. At the time, these systems will have felt staunchly conservative. There’s little here that didn’t feature in the first two <em>Mario RPG</em> games, or indeed a decade of genre classics released before it. But after enduring dozens of tedious <em>Paper Mario </em>reinventions in the years since, it is frankly something of a relief to return to a set of balanced and compelling mechanics, with no stickers, cards, or bags of confetti in sight.﻿</p></blockquote><h3 id="h36092"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TechRadar</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door’s Nintendo Switch remake demonstrates that the 20-year-old Gamecube role-playing game has aged like a fine wine, barely touching its gameplay elements while offering a stunning glow-up in the visual department.

<p>FromSoftware has released the story trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of the expansion’s release</a> on June 21 for all available platforms. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives a glimpse into the player’s journey as they head into the Land of Shadow at the behest of Empyrean Miquella.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m55p6BzELb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in&nbsp;Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives,” the expansion’s description reads.</p>



<p>The expansion will add new weapons, weapon skills, equipment, and magic for players as well as a number of new enemies. As you explore the new area of the Land of Shadow, you’ll be able to “seamlessly travel back and forth” between there and the Lands Between.</p>



<p>When it releases on June 21, Shadow of the Erdtree will cost $39.99. Players will need the base game in order to play the expansion.</p>



<p>After Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring fans shouldn’t expect to see a second expansion for the game. FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a recent interview</a> that there wouldn’t be anything else released for Elden Ring. However, there is still the potential of a sequel somewhere down the line.</p>

<p data-characters="386" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Reviews for the Nintendo Switch remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> dropped earlier today (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including our own</a>), and they’ve unsurprisingly been overwhelmingly positive. What is surprising, though, is that among the game’s quality-of-life updates includes a revised localization and script, which unambiguously cements the character of Vivian as a transgender woman.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">This was highlighted in <a href="https://youtu.be/3ZPwyfIL_qU?si=EjEbli6vQseViJSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Life’s own video review</a> on the remake, which shows off this line from Vivian that wasn’t present in the original Western release: “Truth is, it took me a while to realize I was their sister… not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier.”</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">For context, Vivian was always written as trans in the original <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191203073129/https://themushroomkingdom.net/pmttyd_j2e.shtml#vivian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least in the Japanese script</a>. In fact, this was central to Vivian’s character arc as she eventually joins Mario as a party member, having grown sick of her sister Beldam’s insults whereas Mario treats her with kindness. </p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">When the game was localized and released in the West, this aspect was rewritten; Beldam was still a nasty bully who belittled Vivian’s appearance and clumsiness, but any allusions to Vivian’s gender were excised. For the remake, though, the updated script goes out of its way to ensure there’s no room for debate or alternative reading; Vivian is unquestionably trans.</p>
 <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">I’m honestly shocked this has even happened, but it’s awesome nonetheless. Aside from allowing Vivian’s character arc to be fully realized with no compromises, it’s just nice to see more positive trans representation, particularly in a franchise as huge and popular as <em>Super Mario</em>. <a href="https://x.com/Dededaio2/status/1792907310785830917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans of Vivian on Twitter</a> are seeing this as <a href="https://x.com/mrgrizz123/status/1792914541136736456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an absolute win</a>, though they also acknowledge this is going to <a href="https://x.com/BlackeyeThe2nd/status/1792912703927021607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invite the usual tired discourse and outrage</a>. I must reiterate, this isn’t ‘forced diversity’ on the part of the localization team; Vivian is trans in the original Japanese, so this is an accurate translation.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">The remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> was always going to be worth checking out if only for the pedigree of the original. It would’ve received praise for its combat, funny dialogue, pleasing visuals, and quality-of-life updates anyway, but this tiny clarification to the script is a big deal for a lot of people, and one worth celebrating.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking.877329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="170" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) continues to be one of the most controversial features in first-person shooter titles, and players want to know if it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">Skill-based matchmaking refers to the matchmaking system and algorithms a game uses to find other players.&nbsp;Users are placed in matches based on connection and skill level. After years of silence, Activision finally <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/call-of-duty-wrote-1700-words-in-tell-all-skill-based-matchmaking-blog-yet-changed-nothing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in January that SBMM is used in <em>CoD</em>. In defense of SBMM, Activision argued that it set out to create an even experience where the top and bottom players on the scoreboard don’t have too wide of a gap in ability and wins and losses happen regularly for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">However, a segment of highly skilled&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>players argue that SBMM unfairly punishes them, as they are forced to face increasingly difficult opposition if they perform better. The never-ending debate shows no signs of slowing down soon as the feature still dominates conversations. Here is everything you need to know about whether or not it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking" data-injectable="false">Does <em>XDefiant</em> have SBMM (Skill-based matchmaking)?</h2> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> <strong>does not use skill-based matchmaking for its casual playlist</strong>. If players want a more competitive experience, ranked mode will use SBMM. Ranked won’t officially be available at launch, but players can test the 4v4 competitive mode in a ranked mode practice playlist. Ubisoft plans to add a ranked mode in a future season. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Instead of matching based on skill, <em>XDefiant</em> puts a priority on fast connection times among a list of other factors. </p>
 <ol data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Latency</li> <li>Blocked Players</li> <li>Party Size</li> <li>Region</li> <li>Input Device</li> <li>Platform</li> </ol> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">In saying that, casual matches do not use skill to determine who gets into a game, but once the lobby is full, <em>XDefiant </em>balances the teams based on skill to ensure a somewhat balanced match. Ranked Play will use the same list of criteria, but rank points and matching players within an acceptable rank range will be the most important determining factor. </p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">“We believe that no SBMM is paramount to a fun and varied game experience in the long-term,” Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>. “Frankly, skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive- constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked.” </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="false">Lobby persistence has also been an issue in <em>CoD</em>. <em>XDefiant </em>will test the feature later this year, meaning subsequent games will often include the same group of players from the previous match but will shuffle the users between teams. </p>

<p data-characters="261" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Winning a game of <em>Fortnite</em> is never easy, but some players are convinced that the game’s Zero Build mode has gotten a whole lot harder, with players claiming it’s been “miserable” and that they’re getting “annihilated.”</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">When Zero Build was introduced to <em>Fortnite</em> in March 2022, it provided a safe space for gamers who didn’t enjoy the building aspect of the game, or simply weren’t very good at it. Like many, I ran to the mode and never looked back, and I don’t think I’ve played a build game since. </p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">While I definitely found the mode easier, some players have complained that Zero Build has suddenly become much more difficult, posting about it on the official <em>Fortnite</em> subreddit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Zero Build made me as happy as this guy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">“In the last few days, the lobbies I am getting are significantly harder,” wrote Professional-Wish116. “I am guessing it’s because I am getting better so being put in harder lobbies. Or is it just what it’s like at the end of a season?”</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">They weren’t alone in this feeling either, with Sweet-Cicada-6971 stating: “My experience is the exact same. Basically since yesterday every game feels like a tournament. People are trying so hard, every game I get blasted by TikTokers on Level 500, it’s crazy,” with YrsaAse saying their experience had been “miserable” and that they “weren’t just losing” but getting “absolutely annihilated.”</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">As for why this is happening, the resounding theory is that with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-update-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> starting on May 24, lots of players have returned to the game to rank up their battle passes before they expire. The influx of returning players has then raised the quality of lobbies, making them harder. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="false">Of course, it is possible that Epic Games have tweaked their matchmaking system, but nothing has been announced by the developer so we can’t be sure. We’ll learn more over the next week though as lobbies settle post-update, and we may even hear from Epic if they have made changes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-bucharest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that it's opening a new studio in Bucharest, Romania, representing the studio's fifth development location and its first in Europe.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/bucharest-studio-announcement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on the official Amazon Games website, the Bucharest studio will "focus on supporting Amazon Games' diverse portfolio of games now and in the future".</p>

<p>According to Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann, Bucharest is "one of the top emerging European cities for game development", and the addition of a studio in the city is Amazon's "natural next step".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amazon-games-bucharest-far-cry.jpg?itok=Tn7njGhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amazon-games-bucharest-far-cry.jpg?itok=rdsoYhhm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon Games Bucharest counts former&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>staffers among its number.</figcaption></figure><p>The Bucharest wing of Amazon Games will be headed up by Cristian Pana, a former Ubisoft executive with "more than 20 years of experience building video games", according to Amazon.</p>

<p>He's worked with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Crew</em>, and he says he's excited to join Amazon Games in order to get the chance to work on the company's "exciting roadmap".</p>

<p>As well as announcing Pana's stewardship of Amazon Games Bucharest, Amazon also <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/cristian-pana-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released an interview</a> with its new studio head in which he discusses his career, his achievements, and some of the projects he's overseen.</p>

<p>Pana says that the game of which he's most proud is&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, where he headed up the development of post-launch content.</p>

<p>Those layoffs took place against the backdrop of a wider industry trend that has also seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost">Hasbro</a> letting hundreds of employees go within the last year or so.</p>

<p>Despite that, Amazon still has a pretty stacked slate of upcoming games, with projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-protocol"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, an as-yet untitled&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game, and a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">no, not that one</a>) currently in the works at the company's gaming division.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where Bucharest slots into Amazon's plans. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24160999/hellblade-2-headphones-audio-engineering<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992977/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-looks-extremely-intense"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, the first and only instruction the game provides is that the game is <a href="https://youtu.be/nTek6v64bG4?si=bgQ9B4nEIf3SXEYH">best experienced with headphones</a>. Typically, I always ignore that advice. I’m not a “headphones on, lights off” kind of player. I don’t need <em>ambiance. </em>But for <em>Hellblade II</em>, I decided, “Why not?” What followed was an aural <em>experience</em> that thrilled, frightened, and unsettled the Hel(lblade) outta me.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Of course, if, for whatever reason, you can’t play with headphones, the game’s subtitles and closed captioning do good work conveying the game’s unique audio design.</em></p><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>,<em> </em>the follow-up to 2017’s<em> Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, Senua, a Pict warrior, embarks on another harrowing journey. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">Instead of venturing to the gates of Helheim</a>, she travels north to confront the viking raiders that have been stealing and enslaving her people. On her journey, Senua is accompanied by a Homeric chorus of voices that reflect her struggle with psychosis. The team at Ninja Theory made it a point to explain that they <a href="https://youtu.be/KVBxvlRV0d4?si=-FsKyhWDLqitiAid">consulted with mental health experts</a> — including a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University and people who live with the disorder — in order to portray psychosis respectfully and accurately. That manifests as hearing voices clip in and out of each side of my headphones. At the beginning of the game, I would whip my head left or right as the voices jumped around before I finally grew used to them. </p><p>There’s a richness to the voice performances that are lost if they’re diffused through open air instead of beamed directly into your ears. They speak in short, staccato sentences, contextualizing Senua’s feelings about a particular encounter. When she meets someone, her voices wonder if they can be trusted. In fights, they shout encouragements and admonitions. “Get up. Get up!” or “They’re so strong!” I like the voices. They remind me of my own rapid-fire internal monologue quipping about the myriad things that flit around in my head.</p><p>Senua’s voices also help with navigation and puzzle solving, but not so much that it becomes obnoxious. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there’s none of that “the dialogue tells you the solution” stuff <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631177/chatty-video-game-characters-god-of-war-horizon-forbidden-west-high-on-life-forspoken">that happens in other games</a>. For the first puzzle section involving a path blocked by a large symbol, the voices yell “Focus!” prompting you to press the right trigger to engage Senua’s focus ability. When I got lost during a particularly bewildering section in a dark forest, the voices remarked only once that I was lost then shut up, leaving me to figure out the solution in blessed silence.</p><p>In delving into a drained lake, I could hear water dripping all around me as the caverns echoed with the sound of my breathing. The further I traveled, the darker it got, and the more sinister the sounds became. My breathing slowly transformed into the guttural sounds of disquieted spirits. That should have been a problem. I <em>hate</em> the sounds typically associated with horror — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23416630/scorn-h-r-giger-xbox-game-pass-horror-game">that crawling, squelching sound</a> used whenever a game or movie wants to convey that something’s gross and wet. But the scary sounds in <em>Hellblade II</em> never crossed the threshold into repulsive or triggering for me (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14497584/misophonia-eating-sound-brain-scan-fmri">misophonia sufferers</a>, rejoice). Instead, the sounds were soft and quiet but no less sinister, sounding as though they were just over my shoulder in the real world.</p><div><figcaption><em>When audio enhances visual, </em>Hellblade II<em> becomes a harrowing experience.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ninja Theory</cite></p></div><p>My aural journey with <em>Hellblade II </em>wasn’t limited to sound effects and voices. The music also played an integral role in crafting a visceral full-body experience with the game. Early on, there’s an encounter where it all combines — music, sound effects, and voices — to create a goose bump-inducing moment that I won’t spoil. The tempo of the music combined with the on-screen action created a beat that I could physically feel reverberating in my chest as I played. It’s a game-defining moment that really nails the skill and creativity of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s sound team. </p><p>I’m an aural person, someone who places great emphasis on sound, and <em>Hellblade II</em> felt like it was a game made for me. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there is no in-game UI. There are no tutorial pop-ups that pause the action to tell you what buttons do what or how to interact with the environment. A UI adds a layer of artificiality, reminding you that you that this is make-believe. Without it, the game created a level of reality that I’ve never really experienced before, forcing me to fully inhabit Senua as a character. And with headphones in, I heard so much more of the world and got a greater feeling for Senua’s unique experience in it. </p><p><small><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> is out now on Xbox and Game Pass. </small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-buys-shiver/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has acquired known porting studio Shiver Entertainment from Embracer - the studio behind the recent Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 Switch ports.</p>
<p>The acquisition was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> through an official press release earlier today. Following the acquisition, Nintendo will obtain 100% of the outstanding shares of Shiver to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming behemoth. As mentioned above, Shiver has been working on the recent Switch versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-switch-looks-performs-well-caveats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy</a> and NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>"By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles", the press release reads. "Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1792730561708204474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Bloomberg journalist Takashi Mochizuki on X, many see the acquisition as a way for Nintendo to strengthen resources available for third-party devs to bring more high-end titles to the recently confirmed Nintendo Switch 2, which is expected to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>During Nintendo's most<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent earnings call</a> with investors, President Shuntaro Furukawa talked about expansion, pointing out that acquisitions might be part of the company's strategy, although the focus is expanding via recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires. "Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development", Furukawa said. "In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vcZwIR">Last October, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">completed</a> its $68.7 billion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23546288/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-deal-merger-ftc-latest-news">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and taken ownership of a raft of huge gaming properties, not least among them Activision’s Call of Duty series. Microsoft is now theoretically free to add all Activision Blizzard games to its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23759446/xbox-pc-game-pass-ultimate-subscribe-price-perks">Game Pass subscription service</a> on Xbox and PC. So it’s natural to wonder when Call of Duty games — 2024’s installment in particular — will hit Game Pass.</p>

<p id="DFj8Vu">According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft intends to release the next Call of Duty game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158941/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-microsoft">directly on Game Pass on day one</a>. The game doesn’t have a title or release date yet, but on previous form can be expected in late October or early November 2024. Microsoft is expected to unveil the game and detail its release plans at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Xbox showcase on June 9</a>. However, Microsoft has so far made no official comment on when Call of Duty games might be coming to Game Pass. </p>
<p id="R6LfRz">Activision Blizzard, moving to get ahead of speculation before the completion of the deal with Microsoft, <a href="https://x.com/ATVI_AB/status/1711464921077006751">said on Oct. 9, 2023</a> that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> and its other big 2023 release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-4/40629"><em>Diablo 4</em></a><em>, </em>wouldn’t be added to Game Pass that year, but said it did plan plan to begin adding games to Game Pass in 2024. Indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074326/diablo-4-xbox-game-pass-release-date-blizzard"><em>Diablo 4</em> was added to Game Pass</a> back in March, but Call of Duty so far remains notable by its absence.</p>
<p id="vJUvOu">Speaking to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxuEV8xqEM&amp;t=673s">official Xbox podcast</a> on Oct. 17, 2023, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, “The regulatory process took so long [...] that we weren’t able to get in and work with Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work.” Spencer continued: “The fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future.”</p>
<h2 id="fNEHx9"><strong>When will old Call of Duty games come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="mKu7gi">This is unclear. Microsoft could have added older Call of Duty titles to Game Pass by now, and many expected it to, but it hasn’t. Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/11/22325601/bethesda-games-on-xbox-game-pass-xbox-one-series-x-pc">began adding Bethesda games to Game Pass</a> within weeks of that deal being completed in March 2021. The initial list ran to 20 games, focused on back catalog titles. But this hasn’t happened for Activision Blizzard games.</p>
<p id="cpdTBr">As for the most recent game in the series, <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, Activision has a marketing deal with Sony that will probably preclude that game’s arrival on Game Pass for anything from six months to a year. It also has a well established marketing and business plan for Call of Duty that works on an annual schedule, which Microsoft may not want to ride roughshod over. For those reasons, we wouldn’t expect to see <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>on Game Pass until the end of 2024 — at which point it would be overshadowed by the new game, anyway.</p>
<p id="5Tz9Go">Perhaps Microsoft wants to make the biggest splash possible by having the first Call of Duty title to hit Game Pass be 2024’s brand-new installment. Microsoft may choose to put a range of Call of Duty games on the service at the same time — or it might just focus on the big new release.</p>
<h2 id="jad0Js"><strong>When will other Activision Blizzard games like Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="7x1Elg">A clue to Microsoft’s strategy is its handling of Diablo games on Game Pass. Once again, many expected older games like <em>Diablo 3 </em>and <em>Diablo 2 Resurrected</em> to appear on Game Pass quite soon after the acquisition, but this didn’t happen. Instead, the latest release, <em>Diablo 4</em>, arrived with a splash in March 2024. It seems Microsoft is less focused on putting the whole Blizzard back catalog on Game Pass than it was with Bethesda.</p>
<p id="PQTJCT">One of the biggest unknowns is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. The massively multiplayer game will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2024, but still enjoys a healthy audience which pays <em>WoW</em>’s own monthly subscription fee to play it. Will Microsoft be willing to cannibalize this revenue stream for the sake of what would be a unique and substantial value-add to Game Pass? Perhaps it will, but it’s a difficult calculation to make — so we wouldn’t expect to see it in the first wave of games added, if at all.</p>
<p id="i5wE9i">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/overwatch-2/40628"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, it’s a free-to-play game, so this is less relevant. But Game Pass subscribers have already received some perks for the title, including immediate unlocks for some of the game’s heroes.</p>
<p id="c8gqi7"><strong>Update (Oct. 13, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard on Oct. 13.</p>
<p id="BDDJth"><strong>Update (Oct. 18, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated with comments from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.</p>
<p id="yB6Rus"><strong>Update (May 21, 2024): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the addition of <em>Diablo 4</em> to Game Pass and reports that the next Call of Duty will come to the service.</p>

<p>After 20 years, PlayStation’s London studio has officially closed its doors. The closure comes as part as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-laying-off-900-employees-about-8-of-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced layoffs by Sony</a> that saw 900 people lose their jobs.</p>

<p>“For over twenty years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry,” the studio said. </p>



<p>“As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years. We’ve had one wild and wonderful journey!”</p>



<p>Over its 20 years, PlayStation’s London Studio has been known for making games for the console’s EyeToy accessory in the mid-2000s before developing the SingStar franchise. It also developed a couple games for PlayStation VR: PlayStation VR Worlds and Blood &amp; Truth.</p>



<p>In 2024, the gaming industry has seen over 10,000 people lose their jobs in the first five months. In 2023, roughly 10,500 people lost their jobs within the industry.</p>

On Steam, it features Steam Workshop integration.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Developed and implemented by Yigsoft with close collaboration from the CD PROJEKT RED team, The Witcher 3 REDkit offers a plethora of advanced features as well as full Steam Workshop integration, making publishing — and using — mods easy for both creators and casual players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like a thousand years have passed since Princess Peach first summoned Mario to the seedy city of Rogueport to hunt for the legendary treasure that sleeps beneath the town. In reality, it’s only been 20 since Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door graced the GameCube, but it seems longer because the Paper Mario series has abandoned its traditional turn-based RPG battles ever since. The Thousand-Year Door rapidly faded into legend, kept alive by the spoken word of longtime Nintendo fans who clung onto hope that it would one day open again. </p><p>Finally, that patience has paid off, as the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive version of this classic adventure. It unquestionably justifies why the original is so treasured, pairing a faithful recreation of one of Mario’s most iconic quests with a set of welcome additions and modern improvements that keep it feeling fresh off the printing press even two decades later. Just as Princess Peach tells Mario <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1775568951835083009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he MUST come to Rogueport</u></a>, I’m telling you that you MUST play The Thousand-Year Door.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>From its opening moments to the end credits, it’s still impressive how distinct this RPG feels from any other game in the wide Mario universe. The surprisingly gritty world of Rogueport and its surrounding towns, a lovable cast of offbeat partners Mario recruits along the way, and an Indiana Jones-style race between Mario and the scheming X-Nauts to unlock the secret behind the sleeping door give this journey an unforgettable identity that has passed the test of time with flying colors.</p><p>It helps that the Switch remake is absolutely gorgeous, with lovingly redone character models and dazzling environments that fully commit to the original’s papery, storybook aesthetic. It’s always a joy to look at, and the lighting in darker environments like Hooktail’s Castle, Boggly Woods, and Twilight Town is stunning. It maintains 30 frames per second very consistently, as I only noticed slight framerate dips in moments where the screen is flooded with hundreds of characters at once, but that doesn’t happen often so it never really bothered me. The revamped soundtrack is similarly amazing, with outstanding updated versions of the original tunes and new battle theme arrangements specific to each location.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sharp, laugh-out-loud script is consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004.</p></div><p>The exciting premise and artistic world are backed up by a sharp, laugh-out-loud script that’s consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004. The Thousand-Year Door wastes no time setting its comedic, irreverent tone: Just minutes after Mario sets foot in Rogueport, he’s witness to the town’s high crime rate as members of the Pianta Syndicate get in a brawl with their rival Robbo Thieves in the background. Almost every character does or says something hilarious that also serves the excellent worldbuilding, like the evil, cackling spirits who are convinced they’re cursing Mario for all eternity, when they’re actually blessing him with a useful upgrade. Side characters like those from the Pianta Syndicate and Robbo Thieves constantly intertwine with Mario’s journey, and some folks even email life updates to his Game Boy Advance SP-like phone with adorable photos of themselves attached. How thoughtful!</p><p>Small interludes also stand out, like ones where you play as Princess Peach while she’s held in captivity by the X-Nauts or as Bowser as he searches for the mythical treasure with his moronic band of minions. Some story elements from Princess Peach’s segments haven’t aged <em>super </em>gracefully – it plays up the fact that she has to take off her dress not one, not two, but <em>three </em>separate times across less than 30 total minutes of Peach gameplay – but it’s still fun to see how she assists Mario from afar. The Bowser sections offer a glimpse of how the King of the Koopas comically mismanages his dysfunctional army when he’s not getting tossed around by Mario.</p><p>Another clear highlight is bumping into Luigi throughout Rogueport, where he updates Mario on his parallel misadventures in the Waffle Kingdom. Mario can’t even stay awake to hear the whole story (poor Luigi!), but I love soaking up every word of it. This remake enhances the endearing dialogue even further, as developer Intelligent Systems replaced the generic typewriter text sound from the original with an amusing Animal Crossing-like babbling noise unique to each character type. It’s an impressive touch that shows a willingness to go above and beyond to polish this beloved tale.</p><p>Mario’s quest to collect the Crystal Stars before the X-Nauts do is the backdrop for each of the eight chapters, but some of the most unforgettable moments come from within the smaller stories that pop up. For example, one Crystal Star is the crown jewel of a wrestling championship belt, kicking off an incredible sequence where Mario – dubbed by his promoter as “The Great Gonzales” – climbs the ranks in the Glitz Pit’s cutthroat pro wrestling world. Every chapter has its own flavor like this, and it’s always delightful to see where Mario and friends will end up next.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>It’s Dangerous to Go Alone… Take Partners!</strong></h2><p>Speaking of friends, Mario’s party of seven partners is one of The Thousand-Year Door’s greatest strengths. Each character you recruit has a well-defined design and personality: Koops is an insecure, shy Koopa who musters up the courage to travel with Mario to avenge his father, while Goombella is a smart, sassy student at the University of Goom who’s interested in archaeology. Every chapter provides some backstory for the new companion it introduces that’s generally very sweet and oftentimes strikingly mature and emotionally resonant, which highlights how the series hasn’t managed to match their quality since. </p><p>When exploring, each partner helps out in a unique way: You can kick Koops’ shell to hit far-off switches, while Yoshi significantly increases your speed and can flutter across gaps. The remake’s new Partner Ring lets you change characters on the fly in the overworld, making some late-game puzzles that require lots of partner switching much snappier. And, there’s a robust new hint system you can access at any time where Goombella will tell you exactly what to do next. Some quests are a little bit obtuse at times, like when it’s unclear who exactly you need to talk with to advance the story, so that was a nice fallback that ensured I never got stuck.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Logan Ranks the Mario RPGs</h3><p>I'm not counting Mario + Rabbids because I haven't finished them yet!</p></div><p>Partners also fight alongside Mario during The Thousand-Year Door’s excellent turn-based battles. Paper Mario’s trademark Action Commands are here, where you deal more and take less damage if you properly time the correct button presses. But The Thousand-Year Door takes it much further than basic jumping, hammering, and blocking, spicing up its battles with a great Badge-based upgrade system and electric live audience so I never got tired of fighting at any point during the 30-hour campaign. </p><p>Collectable Badges – which are hidden throughout the world and on sale at Rogueport’s Lovely Howz of Badges – let you customize Mario’s abilities however you want as long as you have enough Badge Points to equip them. There are over 80 Badges to choose from: Some give Mario powerful new types of jump or hammer attacks, like the Quake Hammer, which attacks all non-flying enemies with one big smash. Other badges impact Mario’s stats, like the P-Up, D-Down Badge that boosts attack power but sacrifices defense. I turned my Mario into a glass cannon, to the point where perfect Action Commands disposed of enemies in a flash, but any mistake led to him taking serious damage. As a Paper Mario pro, I loved turning up the heat with my Badge builds to create more of a high-risk, high-reward balance, and it’s always fun to mix and match to try out different combinations if anything starts to feel stale. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pumping up the crowd is one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG.</p></div><p>It’s the live audience, though, that truly pushes battles to the next level. Lots of Nintendo games are presented as stage plays (a tradition going back to Super Mario Bros. 3 and most recently seen in Princess Peach: Showtime!), but The Thousand-Year Door has my favorite implementation of this idea. When a fight begins, Mushroom Kingdom citizens frantically rush into an auditorium to watch it unfold on stage, cheering when Mario does well and leaving early when things go poorly (are they trying to beat traffic?). Hecklers threaten to pelt Mario with rocks and stage lights or fog machines might malfunction during the battle, requiring a timely block. </p><p>Balancing fighting with appealing to the crowd is so dynamic, and it’s even more entertaining when you pull off the Stylish Moves that add flourishes to attacks and make the crowd go wild. Mario can backflip after pulling off a Hammer attack, or Koops can breakdance after rushing through a line of enemies in his shell. Pumping up the crowd through well-executed Action Commands and Stylish Moves fills up Mario’s special attack meter, and it’s one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG. The fights aren’t especially difficult – with the exception of some late-game bosses and optional challenges like the returning Pit of 100 Trials – but keeping track of all the mechanics at play during battle meant I never fell into a repetitive rut where I stopped having to think. If you love punishment, the Double Pain Badge doubles the amount of damage Mario takes, but besides that there aren’t traditional difficulty options to be found here. On the flipside, if you’re a Paper Mario rookie and want to improve your skills, the new Battle Master Toad hanging out in most towns lets you practice your Action Command timing whenever you like with no penalty for messing up.</p><h2><strong>There and Back Again</strong></h2><p>The Thousand-Year Door’s one major flaw I wish this remake had done more to fix is the main quest’s overreliance on backtracking. Most areas have two major points of interest separated by several linear pathways, and the campaign frequently forces you to travel back and forth between them multiple times over the course of a chapter.</p><p>Adventures on the pirate island of Keelhaul Key and in the spooky Twilight Town are especially bad about this. These chapters make Mario travel all the way to the edge of an area, realize he doesn’t have the means to progress further, walk back to the town he started in to get something, then return, and so on. It’s about as much fun as realizing you forgot your wallet as you pull into the movie theater parking lot. The new Partner Ring means your trusty Yoshi steed is more accessible than ever, so at least it’s quicker to run back and forth than it was on GameCube, but that’s a half measure when it comes to fixing the level design, which is noticeably outdated in a remake that otherwise feels pretty modern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do wish more had been done to fix the overreliance on backtracking.</p></div><p>To its credit, Intelligent Systems made several changes to at least somewhat address the backtracking problem without fundamentally changing the original’s design. In Keelhaul Key, a helpful new spring shortcut means you only have to do an annoying section of precise Yoshi platforming once, rather than every time the chapter asks you to go back and forth across its screens. So they removed the painful part, but not the actual trek.</p><p>It’s not as if major changes were unthinkable, because The Thousand-Year Door has some big ones elsewhere, the best of which is its revamped Warp Pipe Room. This fast-travel hub opens up underneath Rogueport a few chapters in, and it’s a total game changer for quests that make you revisit previous locations. In the original, the only way to get to the Glitz Pit was to ride the blimp all the way on the far side of Rogueport. Now, there’s a pipe that zips you straight there, and it’s conveniently labeled in a room filled with pipes that lead back to the central locations from every chapter. Similarly, longtime fans will remember that Chapter 7 contains a particularly ridiculous quest that requires revisiting every major town in the world, but with the help of the new-and-improved Warp Pipe Room I was done with this mission in less than 10 minutes. It wasn’t a particularly stellar 10 minutes in terms of actual entertainment, but it was a lot less tedious than what I’d been braced for. </p><p>Even if solutions like this feel like putting makeup on a blemish that we all can tell is still there,<strong> </strong>I respect the decision to keep this remake extremely faithful, and the combat, story, music, and graphics are so much fun that I really don’t mind the back-and-forth exploration too much. And thankfully, you don’t see any tedium in the fantastic dungeons, which are packed with interesting puzzles, collectibles, and epic boss fights that shake up the usual battle conventions in interesting, cinematic ways. Mario also learns clever paper abilities throughout the campaign, like turning into a paper airplane or rolling up into a tube, and those open up new shortcuts and secrets in the Rogueport Sewers to give exploration an almost metroidvania-like feel at times.</p><p>Outside of the main campaign, the entirely optional side quests are your pretty standard RPG fetch-quest fare. Sometimes they’re good for a laugh, like a mouse who asks Mario to whack him with his hammer over and over again until he remembers something important, but from a reward standpoint they’re largely skippable because they <em>mostly</em> give you items or coins that can easily be found elsewhere. I also dislike the side quest system: Mario can only accept one at a time from Rogueport’s Trouble Center, and you must solve or abandon it before taking on a new task. If this remake is already trying to make things more convenient, why not let us take on multiple quests at once to cut down on the number of times completionists will have to walk back and pick up a new one? As it stands, they don’t seem worth doing… with the exception of <em>one </em>extremely worthwhile reward I won’t spoil here.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="398" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</em> expansion shakes things up all across the world of Azeroth, including the level range for each zone and where you should go based on your level. With the release of <em>World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic</em>, zone levels have changed once again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-kitty-big-city-players-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie feline adventure&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has crossed two major milestones after less than two weeks on sale, which will likely make developer Double Dagger Studio very happy indeed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://x.com/LittleKittyGame/status/1792634871749230934" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that its adorable open-world sandbox game has crossed a million Game Pass players, which isn't surprising given that it's one of the highlights of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-may-2024-games">May's Game Pass lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Double Dagger also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has passed the 200,000 sales mark. It took the game just a little over a week to achieve that goal, which is pretty impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=nVYa-J5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=jke6cnjO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is a popular game, and it's no wonder. I mean, look at the cat!</figcaption></figure><p>The sales figure is even more commendable given that it's in addition to the game's Game Pass player count, which means 200,000 players knew&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>&nbsp;was available via Game Pass and bought it anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>has proven so popular; it's a very sweet little game with arguably the cutest protagonist since&nbsp;<em>Stray</em>'s little friend. If you're a big fan of cats, you need to check it out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, it's a sandbox adventure game set in an unnamed city (which looks very much like it's somewhere in Japan, given its structure and features like painted manhole covers).</p>

<p>One day, while you're napping in your favorite spot just outside your highrise apartment's window, you find yourself plummeting to the ground (painlessly!), and you must find your way home, all while interacting with a cast of colorful and quirky animal characters.</p>




<p>Activities you can engage with in&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>include batting plant pots off ledges, playing with your own tail, and causing humans to drop their stuff so you can steal it for your own nefarious feline purposes.</p>

<p><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177980/Little_Kitty_Big_City/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-kitty-big-city/9nf5s7mlm8xt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Kitty-Big-City-2372180.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also available via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/majora%E2%80%99s-mask-brought-us-the-coolest-swords-in-the-legend-of-zelda.877236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24160854/majoras-mask-coolest-swords-legend-of-zelda-fierce-deity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="gIWmDj">After more than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23537298/tears-of-the-kingdom-legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch">25 years of The Legend of Zelda</a>, the Master Sword has lost its sheen. I’m not talking about the numerous times that Link has literally had to repair or restore the sword. It’s just that I personally have gotten a bit bored with it. Even though the designs vary, many versions just adapt the standard wide-brimmed blade and blue hilt with wings. It’s great and all, but it can feel a bit standard and formulaic. </p>

<p id="xMhbdt">Because of this, I’ve always had a soft spot for Zelda games where Link doesn’t get to use the Master Sword. Link wields the White Blade in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23945144/zelda-minish-cap-underrated-zelda-games"><em>The</em> <em>Minish Cap</em></a> and just a regular sword in <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. These still bore me, but there’s another game where the Master Sword doesn’t appear: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/30/21241902/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-was-never-supposed-to-exist"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em></a>. In fact, <em>Majora’s Mask </em>gave fans the coolest swords in the history of the series and brought out a new, darker side of the franchise. </p>
<p id="dvLDcC">With <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, directors Eiji Aonuma and Yoshiaki Koizumi delivered the oddball darling of the series. In it, Link finds himself not in Hyrule, but in the floundering world of Termina. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2tXLsEUpaQ">Every Zelda game can feel dismal</a> in its own way. But even today, <em>Majora’s Mask</em> feels surprisingly transgressive for a Zelda game. It allows Link to fail — and fail again — in his role as hero. In <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, Link leaps through time to save Hyrule. In <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, the most he can manage is to buy himself a few days before a calamitous moon grimaces above with rounded teeth. And the premise gave the developers the perfect setup to get creative with Link’s powers and especially his sword. </p>

<p id="pMb3fK">Instead of solely using standard tools like weapons, Link collects masks he uses as items. Each one holds the spirit of a dead character, and some even allow Link to transform physically into the likeness of the departed soul. These objects feel cursed with power. In the cutscenes triggered when he puts one on, Link places a mask — like one that resembles the face of a Goron — and screams in agony as he takes on his new body. These new bodies widen the number of powers at Link’s disposal and, in one particular case, give him an exceptionally cool sword. </p>
<p id="fFuYlf">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for the ending of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em>.] </p>
<p id="dcv42i">At the very end of the game, Link can obtain the Fierce Deity mask which allows him to wield the corresponding Fierce Deity sword. It’s a giant double helix blade that twists around itself and can fire discs of light. The sword and its corresponding persona help Link take on the final boss fight in the game and lend him a tremendous amount of power. As far as basic sword analysis goes, it looks and feels cool as hell. It’s no wonder that later games, like <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23713029/best-weapons"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, brought it back. The Fierce Deity mask also shows us a new side of Link’s swordsmanship. </p>

<p id="wjXosS">The Fierce Deity mask gives Link untold power, but at a cost. He becomes a warrior who’s animalistic and monstrous. When the child wearing Majora’s Mask gives Link the cursed item, he asserts that Link is the “bad guy.” According to one fan Wiki, the original Japanese language version refers to the mask as one worn by an “oni” or an ogre. Even Link seems offput by its power, and the description asks, “Could this dark mask’s powers be as dark as Majora?” </p>
<p id="jHwOxG">The Fierce Deity sword isn’t the only cool sword to appear in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. I’m also a fan of the rainbow blade and black rose etchings on the Great Fairy’s Sword. But I personally like the Fierce Deity sword because it shows a side we rarely see in The Legend of Zelda. It allows Link to win the final boss fight, but he sacrifices his humanity during the fight. If you use the mask, he doesn’t win as himself, but with a borrowed monstrous power. It sounds like something Ganondorf would be more likely to do, and less like the antics of the hero. It’s a level of depth rarely shown around the swords in The Legend of Zelda, and because of that (and the fact it looks cool), it’s always been one of my favorites. </p>
