<p>Battlefield fans are up in arms again about a suspected AI design used in the new ‘Windchill’ cosmetics bundle. In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers discovered telling signs tied to a sticker in this bundle, and all indications point to it being a faulty generative AI creation.</p>



<p>Fans on social media platforms were running rampant, trying to burn the game to the ground. For some, it’s a minor issue, but for others, it’s indicative of that much bigger problem creeping across the games industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-ai-sticker-scandal-runs-wild">Battlefield 6 AI Sticker Scandal Runs Wild</h2>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield subreddit</a>, a user shared an image of the new Windchill bundle, revealing a <strong>player card sticker </strong>that stinks of flawed generative AI design. The image showcases a soldier within a snowflake, wielding an M4A1, but there are clear indications that it’s <strong>most likely </strong>created by AI.</p>



<p>The M4A1 in question has two obvious barrels, one above the other. It also seems to have two handguards, which is hardly the most common feature in the world of firearms.</p>



<p>Here’s a zoomed-in shot of the player card sticker:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users were quick to flock to social posts, stating that this isn’t the only example of something that <strong>looks like </strong>generative AI in Battlefield 6. In social circles, the comments were damning. One user wrote, ‘Just the fact they didn’t catch that before releasing shows how little they are trying.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘They got your money, so they don’t care about which hill you choose to die on.’</p>



<p>One user condemned the wider use of AI, ‘AI art is generated based on stolen artwork and takes jobs away from real artists.’ Another echoed that sentiment: ‘I didn’t pay for AI garbage. EA pay your f***ing artists!’</p>



<p>In similar news, the world’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/">first game created 100% with AI</a> recently launched a playable demo, and it went as well as you could expect.</p>







<p>Do you think there’s an issue with Electronic Arts using AI for small elements like this? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/</link>
            <guid>1389700</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Even though Monster Hunter has taken over as the best-selling series made by CAPCOM, the Japanese developer is still betting heavily on the success of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, the ninth mainline game in the globally acclaimed horror series that has sold <strong>more than 178 million units</strong> throughout its thirty-year history.</p>



<p>With Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village, CAPCOM managed to reinvent the saga with a new protagonist, Ethan Winters, and a new perspective, first-person view, in both cases moving away from series staples such as military proficient playable characters and third-person perspective. In many ways, Requiem marks a new chapter that aims to connect elements from both the recent and the older games in the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</h2>



<p>The first rumors about Resident Evil 9 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in March 2024</a>, although it wasn't until June 2025 that CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final title. On this occasion, the studio also communicated the planned release date: <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>. Initially, the game was confirmed for a simultaneous release on Sony's <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, Microsoft's <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>, and <strong>PC</strong> (via Steam and the Epic Games Store). A <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially added a bit later</a>, during a Nintendo Direct presentation held in September 2025.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, while a Deluxe Edition is available at <strong>$79.99</strong>. This provides access to the Deluxe Kit, composed of the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Grace's Costume: Film Noir</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: RE4</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: Film Noir</li>



<li>Screen Filter: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Screen Filter: Film Noir</li>



<li>Four weapon skins, including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Mr. Raccoon Charm</li>



<li>DSO Emblem Charm</li>



<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>



<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d193827c8fc26985d3e10075de5f81c6-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Any pre-order of the game includes the bonus cosmetic item Grace's Costume: Apocalypse. Pre-ordering through the Epic Games Store also grants players access to the Grace Ashcroft Outfit exclusive cosmetics item in Fortnite. Additionally, CAPCOM is releasing a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong> themed after the game (<a href="https://fave.co/3Y7tNKD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at <strong>$99.99</strong></a>) and an <strong>amiibo of protagonist Grace Ashcroft</strong> in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>In Resident Evil Requiem, CAPCOM seeks to offer fans of both <strong>action-horror</strong> and <strong>survival horror</strong> their slice of entertainment, thanks to the dual-protagonist structure.</p>



<p>The setting marks the long-awaited return to <strong>Raccoon City's iconic locations</strong>, including the police station featured in Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. However, Requiem presents the city in a never-before-seen state of ruin, being set thirty years after Raccoon City's nuclear bombing in RE3.</p>



<p>The narrative premise centers on <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong>, an FBI agent with a sharp analytical mind, as the brand new playable character. Grace is assigned to investigate a series of strange deaths. The case ultimately leads her to Raccoon City, more specifically to the Wrenwood Hotel, where her mother Alyssa died eight years before the game's events. The developers have described Grace as a bit of a bookworm who doesn't much trust her own capability to handle dangerous combat scenarios. This choice was made to emphasize survival horror mechanics reminiscent of games like RE2 and RE7, where Grace will be forced to evade detection from various enemies while navigating horrifying environments. </p>



<p>For a long time, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem maintained that the game would also feature another playable character, fan-favorite DSO agent <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong>, previously seen in Resident Evil 2, 4, and 6. The developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally confirmed the rumor at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a new trailer, although the cat was already out of the bag since two days earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to a PlayStation Store leak</a>. The developers later revealed that there is a roughly even split between the two protagonists, with Leon's segments usually being <strong>combat-driven and action-focused</strong>, more akin to Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>CAPCOM has stressed that this seamless interweaving of high-stakes cinematic action with survival elements represents their bold reinvention of the series, as they attempt to balance atmospheric horror with visceral combat scenarios. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Notably, the project initially began development as a multiplayer-focused title with open world design (confirming earlier rumors), before being redesigned as a single-player, more linear experience. CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> realizing that this wasn't what core fans of the horror franchise would have wanted.</p>



<p>Even so, Resident Evil Requiem does introduce at least one major innovation: the <strong>hybrid first-person and third-person perspective system</strong>, which allows players to dynamically switch between viewpoints for the first time in the series so that they'd be able to suit their playstyle. Those who prefer a more scary and immersive experience are likely to gravitate toward first-person, whereas action gamers and traditional fans will probably opt for third-person.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop integrates classic Resident Evil mechanics with modern refinements: <strong>combat, investigations, puzzles, and resource management</strong>. The dual-character structure also aims to create <strong>distinct gameplay identities</strong> that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-complete-rollercoaster-ride-never-before/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the words of Game Director Koshi Nakanishi</a>, will make players feel like they are <strong>on a rollercoaster ride</strong> like never before in Resident Evil. Nakanishi noted that it wouldn't do to keep the horror tension to the max throughout the whole game, because that would be quite exhausting for the player. As such, there will be a dynamic pacing curve that alternates between tense, horrific sequences and some release, exciting combat, and peaceful exploration, before gradually picking up again on the horror part of the curve. To further highlight the differences between Grace and Leon, Nakanishi recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-series-most-fearful-character-leon-kennedy-series-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that Grace is the series' most fearful character yet, while the experienced Leon is the strongest.</p>



<p>A taste of playing as Grace was made available to press and fans alike in the Gamescom 2025 demo that Wccftech's Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">praised in the <strong>hands-on preview article</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, CAPCOM has deliberately designed Requiem to be <strong>accessible to series newcomers</strong> while rewarding veterans through familiar features, such as legacy enemy types and narrative callbacks. Thus, no need to worry if you haven't played all, or any, of the predecessors.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem employs CAPCOM's <strong>proprietary RE Engine</strong>, which was named after the series and was first used in RE7. Nowadays, the RE Engine powers every game developed by the Japanese studio. In most cases, it delivered excellent visuals and solid performance, with the notable exceptions of Dragon's Dogma 2 and Monster Hunter Wilds, both of which were open world games.</p>



<p>Luckily, Resident Evil Requiem's final incarnation is not an open world game and is therefore unlikely to suffer major optimization problems. The developers themselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-same-performance-issues-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> there wouldn't be a repeat of the disappointing launch performance of Monster Hunter Wilds. </p>



<p>CAPCOM already shared the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 11</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX</td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We also know that the PC version of Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support</a> <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> and <strong>path tracing</strong>. Official performance specifications for the console versions have not been publicly disclosed yet. However, the developers briefly discussed the Nintendo Switch 2 version, the least powerful platform among those supported, to reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even they were surprised at how well it ran on the hybrid console</a>. If the Switch 2 doesn't have a problem, the other consoles should run Requiem even better.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#925)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 22]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-22-925/</link>
            <guid>1389694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re kicking off the <strong>official </strong>festive week with the NYT Connections solutions and hints that you need to get the job done! Today’s puzzle is the first in a few that will lead you up to the big day and beyond, so be sure to scroll down as soon as needed to uncover today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #925:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUSH</li>



<li>PIN</li>



<li>PLAYING</li>



<li>LATER</li>



<li>GREETING</li>



<li>CYA</li>



<li>RASH</li>



<li>COMING</li>



<li>WAVE</li>



<li>BUSINESS</li>



<li>FUTURE</li>



<li>BROW</li>



<li>WHIT</li>



<li>FOLLOWING</li>



<li>MEMBERSHIP</li>



<li>SURGE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>They’re all about a sudden <strong>increase in amount or intensity</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em><strong>All imply ‘not yet’ — something ahead in time</strong></em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Which of these words show up <strong>in your wallet, on your desk, or at a game table</strong>?</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are colors that feel like they’re <strong>missing something</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 22:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-22-925">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 22 (#925)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– RASH, RUSH, SURGE, WAVE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMING, FOLLOWING, FUTURE, LATER</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUSINESS, GREETING, MEMBERSHIP, PLAYING</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BROW, CYA, PIN, WHIT</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest for the Wicked co-op update comes in January with persistent realms, but you can play the beta now]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/21/no-rest-for-the-wicked-co-op-update-comes-in-january-with-persistent-realms-but-you-can-play-the-beta-now/</link>
            <guid>1389628</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moon Studios has revealed what’s in store for their ambitious action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a> and the addition of co-op multiplayer. The studio is forging a rather unique path compared to other top-down action RPGs and Soulslikes, with persistent realms you can share with other players.</p>
<p>The No Rest for the Wicked co-op update will arrive on 22nd January in full, but is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/496089445472142295">currently in an open beta on Steam</a>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/496089445472142770">That beta has now been extended to conclude on 5th January</a>, so you can play all through the holiday.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked Together | Co-op update | Wicked Inside Showcase 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayIqY6Sszcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what’s the benefits and reason to Moon Studios’ approach? Well, as outlined in the latest dev diary, there’s a distinct lack of permanence to a multiplayer session in many Soulslikes, and shared online spaces in games like Diablo 4 and Destiny have little meaning to them, just other people running around. But there’s something special about having clanmates to hang out with in an MMO, and so No Rest for the Wicked is blending all of this together.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked will let you convert any single player realm into a multiplayer one, making it a fully online and persistent instance of the game world. Within this you can have up to four players, and you can share this space fully with characters tied to the realm, or bring characters in from other realms. Being persistent, you don’t need a host player to be online, and so anyone can hop in, harvest materials, level up their character, buy property, and go to complete main quests.</p>

<p>That obviously means that you do need to have a trusting relationship with the other players in your realm. The video showcases some of the shenanigans you can get up to, as studio director Thomas Mahler buys up a ton of property through farming progress and then trying to flip the property to the others, and then those others getting a little bit of revenge.</p>
<p>For the more moment-to-moment action, Moon Studio also outline how you can really work together in play, having front line character, ranged builds and healers that can be great for tackling an imposing boss together. At the same time, enemy AI has been adapted to understand more about player positioning, able to react to flanking moves, or exhibiting some new attacks that you won’t see in single player.</p>
<p>For the game as a whole, vendors will now have fresh gear to sell cycling in and out of their shops. Enchantments have been overhauled and higher level items get better rolls – but you now have limited rerolls – while weapons can now deal crit damage, and have random Facets to provide different stats. Socketing gems will now give fixed improvements, but there’s now higher tier gems. Exhalting (a bit like prestiging an item) needs you to have completely maxed out your item first, boosting a random item in a particular category multiple times.</p>
<p>All enemies are now back-stabbable in combat (if you’re good enough), and bows have been enhanced with a new off-hand Quiver to introduce different arrow types (like blasting, explosive arrows).</p>
<p>Oh, and for the high difficulty sickos out there, the highest difficulty now has more enemies than before.</p>
<p>The game has come through a difficult year, with Moon Studios having to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/moon-studios-is-now-self-publishing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-after-split-with-take-two/">split off from publisher Private Division and go it solo</a>, and with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-bomb-studio-closure/">Mahler having a weird moment on social media</a>. Since entering Early Access in early 2024, progress has also been steady as opposed to blistering, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/the-breach-update-is-out-today-for-no-rest-for-the-wicked/">a big update earlier this year</a>, and now the imminent addition of multiplayer (which will certainly have been a mountain to overcome), the future for this game is rather encouraging.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is out now in Steam Early Access, with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions planned for when it’s good and ready.</p>

		<p>Music really has become a huge part of modern gaming, the best examples not just elevating the game as you play it, but sticking with you as the original compositions lodge themselves in your mind to emerge while you’re doing the dishes, waiting in line at the supermarket or other incongruous moments.</p>
<p>The difficulty with game music is just how varied it is. There’s sweeping orchestral scores, there’s jazzy chip tunes, there’s songs, there’s ambient music, regional influence and soundtracks that look to encompass hundreds of years of history.</p>
<p>For us, as we tried to consume as many soundtracks as we could this year, there were some clear standouts, but we had to pick one.</p>



<p>Of all the great video game music created this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei’s</a> really hits the high notes – this lacklustre pun absolutely intended. Composed by Toma Otowa, a multi-award-winning film and video game composer, the sweeping and beautiful compositions that accompany the player bring to life the world of Ghost of Yotei through a rich and culturally textured score.</p>

<p>What sets Tomo’s work apart for Ghost of Yotei is the attention to detail, seamlessly blending traditional Japanese instruments (like shamisen, shakuhachi, biwa, and Ainu instruments such as tonkori and mukkuri) with Western influences. There’s even a delightful smattering of spaghetti western-style elements to the score, a perfect fit for the revenge story of protagonist Atsu. Overall, a unique cultural fusion is blended, managing to complement the bombastic gore-soaked action whilst also providing the quiet melancholy that underpins the sorrow-tinged beats of Atsu’s emotional journey.</p>
<p><em>– Ade</em></p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It’s rare that I listen to a game’s soundtrack when I’m not actively playing the game, but then again <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is a rare game. If you were to listen to the somber, melancholly of “Gustave” or the beautiful violins of “Firecamp – Sciel,” you might be surprised later when you hear “In Lumiere’s Name,” a tango for a battle with a mime, or “Is it a Gestral or a Volleyball?” which is at least as silly as it sounds. They could be from completely different games – though both French, obviously. Or perhaps the epic distorted guitars of “Une vie à peindre” would be more of a surprise?</p>
<p>Much like the rest it, the soundtrack of Expedition 33 is emotional, whimsical, silly, heavy, and French all at once. The soundtrack is as varied as it could possibly be, from slow, morosely beautiful, smaller tracks perfect for the dramatic brooding over the most recent unbelievable revelations, all the way up to the huge heavy hitting boss battles that really get your heart pounding when you need to try and keep focused on parrying and dodging. Frankly, it’s a delight all the way through. It’s clear that composer Lorien Testard poured a lot of love into this soundtrack and it shows as, truly, one of the best I’ve experienced ever.</p>
<p><em>– Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Skate Story –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>How do you soundtrack a game about a glass skateboarding demon on their way to eat the moon? If you’re Sam Eng and you’re making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>, you draft in an entire indie band and let them loose on your gorgeous, existential exploration of the underworld. There’s a lot of leeway in what that might sound like, but with the neon, crystal-infused, ephemeral visuals, it made sense to bring electronica, synth, and a retro-modern outlook that speaks to the 1980s as much as it does the 2020s.</p>
<p>This is a true album too. Skate Story Vol.1 is an auditory journey that’s as essential as the game it soundtracks, and you’ll find yourself travelling back to the half-places and looming edifices of the demon’s journey as you sink ever further into Blood Cultures’ retro-pop.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> has popped up on Wired's (fantastic) Tech Support series (did you know that we're closer in time <a href="https://youtu.be/E7oEq6CE78g?si=dhAH__k4FyEl0vzp&amp;t=9">to Cleopatra than Cleopatra is to the beginning of ancient Egypt</a>?) answering questions about – well, himself, in the main.</p>
<p>While the web series has featured game developers before - including Dead Space creator and Sledgehammer Games co-founder, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXdJU9ZUX8">Glen Schofield</a> - this interview was purely about Kojima himself and how he sets about writing, making, and even assessing his own video games.</p>

<p>Kojima said a number of interesting things - including how important it is that you feel "the creator's love" in games, and encouraging player experimentation - but also opened up about his well-documented love of movies, the future of gaming, and how he tries to make a world that "makes you want to stay and play".</p>
<p>He also said that he doesn't "have" experts that offer specialised science or history knowledge, which is why he studies "daily", reading literature, watching documentaries and news specials, as well as researching things online or at the library.</p>
<p>"If you're watching and thinking, 'I'll be Kojima's right-hand man!' please contact me," he joked.</p>
<p>There's also a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into how he personally tests and tunes his games, including listening with both headphones and speakers, tweaking difficulty, and "fixing story pacing issues".</p>
<p>"It's a very crucial stage," he said. "Not many do this, I think."</p> <div>

<p>Kojima also popped up on <a href="https://x.com/NetflixJP/status/2001789572586574127">Netflix Japan</a> recently, too, interviewing the Duffer Brothers at what seems to be Kojima Productions' office. In it, the brothers admitted how much Japanese culture impacted them, particularly games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, which "really influenced the whole look of the Upside Down and the other dimension".</p>
<p>They also mentioned Metal Gear Solid, but that may have been because Kojima was the one interviewing them.</p>
<p>"Those [games] were all discussed in the room," they said. "It was filtered through the lens of how we remembered seeing them and playing them for the first time when we were young and filtered through our experience, but they were just as much a part of Stranger Things [as influences from The Big Three, John Carpenter, Spielberg, and Stephen King]."</p>

I made it simple, yet something that will leave an impression the moment you see it.</p><p>I sat in on the audition and also took part in the recording sessions, so  the characters turned out just as I imagined. The story is partly related to the main scenario of the comics, so I hope you look forward to that too.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <guid>1389517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> for a long time. Rumors of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">allegedly-real-but-never-released Switch Pro</a> swirled around for years as I watched fewer and fewer AAA third-party games make their way to Nintendo’s little console that could. There were always enough first-party titles and indie games to tide me over, but I watched with some envy as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">games like <em>Elden Ring</em></a> took the world by storm, knowing I’d have to wait until Nintendo’s next generation hardware arrived to add them to my Switch library. Now, finally, it’s here.</p><p>The Switch 2’s core strength for me boils down to it being a better version of the original Switch. Its 7.9-inch 120Hz 1080P screen looks sharp — yes, an OLED display would have been nicer, but I’m not complaining — and its ability to output at up to 4K, or up to 120Hz at lower resolutions, is a welcome improvement. It can play most original Nintendo Switch games, some of which have been updated through free or paid patches to run at a higher frame rate or resolution.</p><p>The only native Switch 2 game I’ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I picked up as part of a bundle with the system. My most-played game is the original Switch title <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which runs at 4K and 60 frames per second if you get the Switch 2 edition for $10 (it’s a free download if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription). That subscription also allows me to play a growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642436/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-f-zero-hands-on">GameCube games available as Nintendo Classics</a>, including titles I didn’t get to play when I was a kid.</p><p>I specifically put off playing games from my backlog, including titles going back several years, until I could play them on a larger display in handheld mode, and I don’t regret my decision. Putting dozens of hours into <em>Octopath Traveler</em> while chilling on the couch with the big-screen handheld was a heck of a lot of fun. Nintendo and third-party developers have also been pretty generous with releasing free demos of Nintendo Switch 2 titles, including <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, so it’s possible to sample bigger titles before deciding to pick them up.</p><p>My only real complaint with the Nintendo Switch 2 is its 256GB of internal storage, which isn’t enough for folks like me who’ve built up a large digital library of Switch games. Adding more requires you to pop in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-AM/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a><strong>, </strong>which can be twice the price of than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD512SA-AM/dp/B0C1PRYPYX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">regular microSD cards</a> used by the original Switch. My hope is that if a hardware revision comes down the line it’ll include an OLED display and at least 512GB of storage. By that time microSD Express cards will have hopefully become more affordable.</p><p>The console’s $449.99 starting price came as a shock to many, but it seems fair given its tech specs, and an escalating tariff situation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">delayed the Switch 2’s preorder timing</a> in North America and compelled Nintendo to raise the price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">original Nintendo Switch</a>. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">recently announced</a> that it “will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.” I’ll continue to look forward to exclusive titles making their way to my new console of choice, along with ports of third-party games that I haven’t gotten around to yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/845477/nintendo-switch-2-game-system-favorite]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As we come barreling toward the end of the year, you can still find all sorts of great tech deals. Lots of good stuff has been marked down for holiday shopping, but there is no rule against using these hefty discounts to secure a nice new gift for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6540/">If you’re been in the marker for a new computer, you can upgrade to the Apple iMac right now while saving yourself 12%.</a> That may not sound like a ton, but it actually cuts the price down by $150. The M4-powered iMac which usually runs for $1,299 is now just $1,149 through the holiday season.</p>
<p>This 2024 Apple iMac all-in-one desktop computer is powered by the M4 chip. This chip is one of Apple’s most powerful yet. The M5 just came out, but this one is still remarkably reliable. It’s built for Apple Intelligence and will keep your system running smoothly whether you are editing photos, building out decks, gaming, or bouncing between a million and one browser tabs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6540/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Display</h2>
<p>With an all-in-on computer, you’re committed to whatever screen its built out of. Good thing this one is sleek as heck. The 24-inch retina monitor displays in a crisp resolution of 4.5K and features 500 nits of brightness. The screen supports up to one billion colors, so you will be looking at a highly detailed screen with a ton of color depth. This is excellent for anyone who works in a visual medium all the time like photographers touching up their photos.</p>
<p>With this iMac, you have a built-in camera and microphones for all your video conferencing needs. The 12MP webcam is equipped with Center Stage. This is a features that tracks the person in view, subtle adjusting the camera to follow them for both a more dynamic video feed and to ensure they always stay in frame. It even works for groups in front of the camera. The three on-board microphones can capture studio-quality audio and the six speakers utilize Spatial Audio for an enhanced listening experience, both on calls and when watching various media—be it a movie, show, or random YouTube video.</p>



<p>If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone or iPad, you can seamlessly integrate your devices with the iMac. Copy something from your iPhone and paste it to your iMac. Sends texts using your keyboard at your iMac. Lots of versatility.</p>
<p>The iMac is strikingly thin. It’s just a good looking piece of hardware. Plus, it comes is a variety of fun colors. You can stick with the traditional silver is you want something that will fit any aesthetic. Or you can opt for something with a bit more pizzaz. Amazon has the blue, green, and pink options in stock along with the silver. The blue, green, and silver are each seeing that $150 discount. The pink model is still on sale, but you’ll only save a bit over $100 as its price tag has only dropped to $1,196.</p>

            <p>The Indie Game Awards has withdrawn two awards previously given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, not because of the debate about what does and doesn't constitute an "indie" game, but because a representative of Sandfall Interactive had agreed that no gen AI had been used in the development when, in fact, it had.</p>
<p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," the nomination commitment explained. "When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p>"In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p>

You’ll get some scrolling exposition text setting up the events of the game, and you’ll either be plonked in the middle of a room or a field, ready to save the princess, or wake up after a dream or a shipwreck or something. I’m generalising, but there’s something intimately familiar about <em>how</em> an old-school Zelda game often stands out. It’s cosy, it gets you asking questions, and it's very <em>fantasy</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> doesn’t do all of that. After your obligatory context dump, protagonist Pippit is sitting in the back of a taxi, yapping away at the driver. He’s talking about his family – whom he’s going to visit – and his yoyo skills. And he really loves his yoyo. He’s confident, chatty, but far away from your typical hero with an attitude and a lack of direction.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pxthzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Playing through Pipistrello over the summer, I was completely enchanted by its chunky spritework and its sprawling metropolis map. The vibes are the complete opposite of a Zelda game. Except that’s almost exactly what Pipistrello is – a top-down GBA-inspired Zelda with an injection of energy, colour, and attitude. It’s got sass for days and an extremely fun mesh of platforming, combat, and exploration, all driven by a simple walk of the dog… and a bunch of other tricks.</p>
<figure data-uuid="38f3897dadca0"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38f3897dadca0/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>No sooner than Pippit’s auntie Madame, head of Pipistrello Industries, is attacked by four frustrated industry owners, is the young bat forced to confront the issues his family’s business has caused. Oh, and because of the battery-power spell used on Madame, his yoyo is now possessed by his auntie, and she frequently likes to speak to him. Yes, this is absolutely a love letter to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a>.</p>
<p>Pippit and Madame’s banter makes the game for me in the same way that I loved Ezlo’s snarky nature in Capcom’s GBA Zelda game. And while Link doesn’t talk, I remember thinking of ways to backchat Ezlo multiple times. With Pipistrello, Pippit is already doing that – and sometimes it’s earned, because while Madame may love her nephew, she’s not exactly supportive of his love of the yoyo.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2b3a2a0142b77"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b3a2a0142b77/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because Pippit speaks, it immediately gives the game a different kind of energy. Think about the pacing and the world of a top-down Zelda: it’s usually steady, lush and green, and each map is the kind of place you can steadily make your way around, chopping down octoroks, chuchus or patches of grass. Pipistrello might look cute and cuddly, but that electric colour palette only helps bolster the more kinetic movement of the little bat and his yoyo, now enhanced with battery-powered magic and a grumpy aunt.</p>
<p>Every new attack or skill is based on a real-world yoyo trick, and their uses logically make sense. Round the World, for instance, sees Pippit spin the yoyo around his head, pushing enemies away. He also has a charged attack that will keep the yoyo in-place to do multiple hits of damage. And there are plenty of angled corners everywhere, which Pippit can use to bounce his yoyo off of to grab items from afar or attack enemies on the other side.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0bf5654775a73"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bf5654775a73/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Upgrades don’t come in the form of new weapons or upgrades, or even new outfits. Instead, you have to earn them by paying off a debt to your cousin Pepita. Again, something that totally makes sense in an urban environment and within a family that’s fuelled by greed and money. The debt stays with you and half the money you collect goes towards paying it off, but you’re also lumbered with a debuff or two until you pay it off. You might have one heart fewer or be a little slower for a while. Picking the upgrade you want at the right time is crucial, because no one wants to go into a boss fight with lower defenses.</p>
<p>But I think the traversal is where the game really shines, and the creativity of each trick is so fun to play around with. Walk the Dog is now a kind of auto-run, which pulls Pippit along water and bounces off of angled corners. The UFO allows Pippit to suspend the yoyo in mmid-air off-string, so he can hook onto it and jump over large gaps. Every single skill is hugely important, because each one will lead to a different secret, a Petal Container (a very subtle nod to a Heart Piece), a Badge (think Paper Mario), or a hidden room.</p>
<p>It’s just like blowing up a wall with a bomb, but Pipistrello does it with its own flair, and a dash of Metroidvania connectivity and backtracking. But with how densely packed each screen is – whether it be dissatisfied citizens or people queuing up to gorge on fast food, enemies hopping around, holes in the ground, traffic, etc. – this large city feels lived-in. This isn’t a forest and a beach and a jungle all linked together; it’s a metropolis crumbling under the weight of corporate competition.</p>

<p>The city itself is a character as a result – split into four distinct districts, with Pipistrello Manor at the far north, each one is home to one of the four business owners who attacked Madame. There’s also an entire underground sewer map (the depths? Say it ain’t so!) which is just another delightful collection of movement puzzles and secrets.</p>
<p>Old Rattalia Town is home to the Roquefort Shopping Center and is a hub of commerce, food, and trouble, while the Fadalins Neighborhood is home to a much greener area, and where the FadaFest Convention takes place. And each district has its own dungeon. C’mon, you didn’t expect <em>dungeons</em> in a Zelda-inspired game? And all of them are brilliant.</p>
<p>The PoultryFC Stadium might be my favourite, a football stadium which culminates in a match against Cuca Carrara’s (one of those aforementioned business leaders) team, which the boss has been using to fix matches and steal money from eager gamblers. Toxy runs a never-ending convention that scams attendees with crypto-like schemes, and to end it, you have to fight a cosplayer called Linkoln. Yeah...</p>
<figure data-uuid="3f54d17a92b52"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f54d17a92b52/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each of these mazes is an interconnected playground of puzzles, enemy gauntlets, items, and more. And the puzzles in Pipistrello aren’t easy; logical, but tricky. Think of scenarios where you have to Wall-Ride, jump, bounce off the wall, hook onto a UFO, and then Wall-Ride again. Every movement skill often comes into play in succession, particularly in some of the optional challenges. But when you get the item at the end, it feels so good.</p>
<p>Pipistrello may wear its influences proudly on its sleeve, but it’s all the better for it in my eyes. It gives the ever-popular top-down Zelda formula a shot of spiritedness, a dash of brashness, and a pop of colour. This isn’t a game about saving one person or saving the world from a great evil – the evil here is capitalism, people trying to make a profit to benefit their own industry. And Pippit recognises that the four industry bosses are part of the problem, but the ultimate problem is caused by his aunt.</p>

<p>There’s no empathy for Link’s foes in Zelda, because those games are a tale of good versus evil. But in Pipistrello, Pippit is empathetic to his enemy’s concerns; his aunt <em>has</em> been hogging all the power and putting pressure on other businesses. This moral core is only possible <em>because</em> of the setting and gameplay – this is a classic Zelda for the modern day, addressing concerns that we all have. Not a fantasy, but an Around the World reality.</p>
<p>If you felt let down by last year’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, or you’re really craving some pixel art Zelda-style gameplay with a touch of Metroidvania (and I know there’s been a bunch of those this year), please don’t sleep on Pipistrello. It’s a masterclass in level design that deserves to be celebrated.</p>

              <p>If there’s one thing that can transform how your home feels without dropping hundreds on new furniture, it’s the lighting you choose. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">Govee smart bulbs now cost just $17 for a two-pack on Amazon, down from the usual $25, and you can stack an extra 10% off with the promo code IZVCRPT14KV7</a> to hit a record low price that makes upgrading your entire house ridiculously affordable.</p>
<p>You get <strong>1000 lumens of brightness per bulb</strong> (equivalent to old 75W incandescents), <strong>access to 16 million colors</strong>, <strong>tunable white light</strong> from warm 2700K to cool 6500K, <strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity</strong>, and full <strong>voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant</strong>. These bulbs create different atmospheres for different moods without you touching a dimmer switch. Order today and Amazon delivers them before Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000 Lumens Really Lights Up Big Rooms</h2>
<p>That 1000-lumen output is a lot more important than it sounds like it would be: Cheap smart bulbs usually only go up to 600–800 lumens which means that even at full brightness, they don’t light up big rooms very well. You can make them brighter when you need task lighting or dim them down across the full 1–100% range for ambiance. The CRI90+ color rendering index makes colors look real and true instead of washed out like they do under cheap LEDs.</p>



<p>You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors</strong> so you can get the exact shade you want instead of going through a few presets that never quite match what you had in mind. You can make your living room glow purple while your kitchen stays warm white, or you can set all the bulbs to the same energizing blue-white for morning routines. The <strong>tunable white range goes from 2700K to 6500K</strong> which is the range of colors that goes from the warmth of candlelight to the brightness of office daylight.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee Home app gives you access to 54 scene modes</strong> that handle the color programming for you if you don’t want to manually adjust settings. <strong>Music sync mode makes the bulbs change colors </strong>when your phone’s microphone picks up sound, turning any playlist into a light show that pulses with the beat. Sunrise and sunset timers gradually brighten or dim the lights to wake you naturally or ease you into evening, and you can schedule these automations to match your actual daily routine instead of fumbling for switches half-asleep.</p>
<p>You can control these bulbs from anywhere using the app, even when you’re not home, which lets you turn the lights on before you get there or check to see if you left something on after you left. You can change the brightness, colors, or turn lights on and off with your voice using Alexa or Google Assistant. This feels like the future at first, but then it quickly becomes the only way you want to interact with lights. The dual connectivity also acts as a backup;<strong> if your Wi-Fi goes down, you can still use Bluetooth to control things locally</strong>.</p>
<p>The bulbs fit in <strong>standard A19 sockets</strong> and work with any lamp or fixture that takes regular screw-in bulbs and makes installation as easy as changing old bulbs. Most routers send out 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals, which these devices can connect to. These 9-watt bulbs use a lot less electricity than old 75-watt incandescent bulbs, but they still give off the same amount of light.</p>
<p>The $17 price for two bulbs becomes even better when you apply that 10% promo code, and brings your <strong>effective cost down to around $7.65 per bulb.</strong> That’s cheaper than many dumb LED bulbs that just turn on and off, except these give you millions of colors, remote control, voice commands, scheduling, and music sync capabilities.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-community-led-renaissance-kyber-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>1389487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>DICE's <strong>Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> launch in November 2017 was notoriously hindered by the loot box scandal. The game's original monetization scheme provided in-game advantages to those who chose to spend real money to expedite unlocks. The developers increased the rate at which players could work toward unlocks simply by playing the game. However, shortly before the release date, a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/it_takes_40_hours_to_unlock_a_hero_spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calculated</a> that it would still take around 40 hours of gameplay to unlock a hero. </p>



<p>This prompted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/comment/dppv3bo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer response from the EA Community Team</a> that included the infamous <strong>'sense of pride and accomplishment'</strong> comment, which riled up fans so badly that it went down (as certified in 2019 by the Guinness World Records) as <strong>the most downvoted comment in Reddit's history</strong> with over 683K downvotes. Belgian authorities even started an investigation, while as of November 16, 2017, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claim-star-wars-battlefront-ii-not-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was still maintaining</a> that the loot box model did not constitute gambling. The following day (which was also the release day), though, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove all microtransactions from the game</a>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, all this controversy greatly harmed the reputation of Star Wars Battlefront II in the eyes of many gamers. It's a shame, because the game itself was very enjoyable, and over time, it garnered quite a dedicated following. DICE improved it with various content updates, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-on-scarif-update-date-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in late April 2020</a>. Still, the community wanted more, and that's how the <a href="https://kyber.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER project</a> began.</p>



<p><strong>KYBER</strong> is a custom server platform and mod launcher that completely replaces Star Wars Battlefront II's official online infrastructure on PC and introduces various additions, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated 24/7 community-operated servers</strong> that allow players to host persistent game sessions with custom rulesets, map selections, and gameplay modifications.</li>



<li><strong>Full support for community-made mods</strong>, enabling creators to develop new gameplay mechanics, cosmetics, balance changes, and content entirely separate from official patches.</li>



<li><strong>Key mode changes,</strong> such as Supremacy being developed into the Battlefield-inspired Conquest mode, where matches are faster paced and have a clearer flow.  </li>



<li><strong>A fully functional server browser</strong>, which was missing in the official game.</li>



<li><strong>Proximity-based voice chat</strong>, where players hear teammates and nearby opponents based on in-game distance rather than team-only channels, encouraging organic squad coordination without requiring external platforms like Discord.</li>



<li><strong>Detailed stats tracking</strong> that allows players to review their career statistics across both official online servers and KYBER servers.</li>



<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> that leverages the game's built-in spectator camera. Useful to monitor suspicious players, view epic battles, and more.</li>
</ul>

<iframe title="KYBER is NOW OFFICIALLY PUBLIC | Galactic Assault | Star Wars Battlefront 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KawoPSZ89ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but after four years of work, KYBER launched a few hours ago in Open Beta to expand the player base and help refine the last bugs ahead of the full release. You can now install KYBER following this procedure:</p>



<h2 id="h-prerequisites-preliminary-setup">Prerequisites (Preliminary Setup)</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Own a legal PC copy of Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> (via EA App, Steam, Epic Games, or EA Play subscription)</li>



<li><strong>Disable the Discord overlay</strong> for Battlefront II</li>



<li><strong>Disable FrostyFix</strong> (it conflicts with KYBER)</li>



<li><strong>Launch vanilla Battlefront II once</strong> after installation to initialize the game</li>



<li><strong>Register a free NexusMods account</strong> or log in with your existing one on the NexusMods website.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-installation-steps">Installation Steps</h2>



<p><strong>Steps 1-2: Downloading and Running the Installer</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/kyber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER Discord server</a></li>



<li>Navigate to <code>#download</code> channel and click "here" to download the installer</li>



<li>If the browser blocks the download, select "more info" then "download anyway"</li>



<li>Extract the downloaded <code>.zip</code> file</li>



<li>Double-click the installer <code>.exe</code> file</li>



<li>Click "Yes" when prompted to allow KYBER to modify your computer</li>



<li>Click "Next" through the installation wizard until "Finish"</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Step 3: Antivirus Whitelisting</strong><br>Windows Security and third-party antivirus software must exclude KYBER directories to prevent false-positive threats:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KYBER Launcher</code></li>



<li><code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\ArmchairDevelopers</code></li>
</ul>



<p>Access exclusions via: Windows Settings → Update &amp; Security → Windows Security → Virus &amp; Threat Protection → Manage Settings → Add or Remove Exclusions</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: EA Account Authentication</strong><br>Log in to KYBER using your <strong>EA account</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: Maxima Launcher Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Click "Open Maxima Launcher" when prompted</li>



<li>The EA App will automatically shift to <strong>Offline mode</strong> (this is intentional)</li>



<li>The EA App must remain offline or closed while playing KYBER</li>



<li>If Windows Defender prompts for network access, click "Allow"</li>



<li>To later play on the official EA servers: close KYBER, set EA App to Online, and launch normally</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 6: NexusMods Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Log in to NexusMods inside KYBER (do not create a new account inside KYBER)</li>



<li>In the NexusMods pop-up window, scroll down and click "Allow" to authorize</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 7: Joining a Server</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Go to the "Home" section to open the server browser</li>



<li>Select a server and click "Download Mods"</li>



<li>Once downloads complete, click "Play" to join</li>



<li>Mods download only once per server</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 8: Managing Mod Downloads</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mods with fewer than 150 NexusMods downloads require manual search in the "Mods" tab</li>



<li><strong>Popular mods download faster</strong> (Battlefront Plus V10 Beta101 and Battlefront Expanded V7.1 host files directly on KYBER servers, bypassing NexusMods throttling)</li>



<li>Users can also download mod <code>.zip</code> files from the NexusMods website and drag-and-drop into the KYBER window for installation</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 9: Proximity Chat Configuration</strong><br>After launching Star Wars Battlefront II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Press "Insert" or Alt-Tab to KYBER</li>



<li>Go to "Settings" → "In-Game Settings"</li>



<li>Configure proximity chat:
<ul>
<li>Enable/disable voice</li>



<li>Adjust volume</li>



<li>Choose push-to-talk or always-on mode</li>



<li>Select audio input/output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The KYBER team had also promised to release the source code, but they asked for a little more time to make it 'more presentable'. As such, the current plan is to make it public next month (January 2026).</p>



<p>While a few members of the original development team at DICE <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are interested in making Star Wars Battlefront III</a>, it may be a long time before Lucasfilm actually gives the green light to such a project. Thankfully, the PC community at least will be served by the continued development and improvement of KYBER.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M5 With Max Config Drops Record Low, Amazon Drops Margin While Official Site Stays Full Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m5-with-max-config-drops-record-low-amazon-drops-margin-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000655017</link>
            <guid>1389472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with these M5 MacBook Pro models a few weeks ago and they’re still full price on Apple’s website, but <strong>Amazon decided to spread some holiday cheer by lowering the prices on all models to all-time lows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">24GB/1TB model now costs $1,799 instead of $1,999</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">the 16GB/512GB model now costs $1,349 instead of $1,599</a>. This means that these M5 machines are actually cheaper than the M4 generation was when it first came out. You get here Apple’s new M5 chip, a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid display that can reach 1600 nits of brightness and a battery lasts all day. The<strong> 24GB model will be shipped before Christmas</strong>, and the 16GB model will be sent by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful M5 Chip</h2>
<p>The M5 processor doesn’t just make the M4 better but it also changes the way a laptop handles heavy workloads. Each GPU core now has a Neural Accelerator that speeds up AI tasks by a lot which means you can handle machine learning workloads and Apple Intelligence features at speeds that would have needed a desktop workstation just a few years ago. The 10-core CPU can easily handle everything from video editing to compiling software and the unified memory architecture means that your RAM talks directly to the processor, so there are no bottlenecks like those that happen with regular laptop designs.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence runs completely on your device so your private information never leaves your MacBook to be processed on a cloud server. The system helps you write better, make your ideas clearer, and do repetitive tasks automatically without sending your data to Apple or anyone else. This <strong>privacy-first approach is much more important than most people think </strong>and it lets you use AI features without worrying that your emails, documents, or creative work will end up in a training dataset.</p>



<p>The <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a peak brightness of 1600 nits</strong> for HDR content and a steady brightness of 1000 nits for regular use. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio makes blacks look really black instead of that grayish tone you see on cheaper laptop screens. The colors are also very accurate, making this a good choice for professional photo and video work.</p>
<p>The promise of a battery life that lasts all day isn’t just a marketing gimmick: This laptop works the same whether it’s plugged in or running on battery power. Most Windows laptops slow down when you unplug them to save power, but the M5’s efficiency lets you render video, compile code, or run resource-intensive creative apps at full speed for hours without needing to find an outlet. You can really take this to a coffee shop and work all day without bringing the charger.</p>



<p>The ability to <strong>work with other Apple devices makes the whole ecosystem better</strong> than any one product could do on its own: You can control your iPhone from your Mac’s screen with iPhone Mirroring which means you can reply to texts or use apps that only work on iPhones without having to pick up your phone. You can copy something on your iPhone and paste it straight into a document on your Mac. You can also start a FaceTime call on your laptop and then switch to your phone when you need to move around.</p>
<p>The 24GB/1TB model costs $1,799, and the 16GB/512GB model costs $1,349 and that’s<strong> less than what the M4 generation cost when it first came out</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Needed a Decade to ‘Feel Comfortable’ with Creating ‘New Stuff’ in Fallout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/</link>
            <guid>1389469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is one of the most recognizable post-apocalyptic franchises in modern gaming. It has become a multimedia gem in recent years with the emergence of the live-series television show, and it boasts a lengthy lineup of titles that span almost a thirty-year history. </p>



<p>In 2004, Bethesda Game Studios acquired a license to develop Fallout 3, before purchasing the franchise outright in 2007. In the words of one of the most notable developers in the Fallout space, it wouldn’t be until Fallout 4 was developed and released almost a decade later that the team felt ‘comfortable’ with the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-comfortable-with-creation-in-fallout">Getting Comfortable with Creation in Fallout</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Emil Pagliarulo, one of the Bethesda veterans who has driven the production of Fallout forward over the years, dropped a tasty titbit. He suggested that it took <strong>a long time </strong>for Bethesda to get comfortable with this legendary series, especially following the pivot that saw Fallout 3 become a transformative first-person RPG.</p>



<p>He suggested that buying the brand wasn’t enough for the company to feel as flexible and inventive as they might have wanted. In Fallout 3, it was all about paying tribute to what had come before, and it wasn’t until 2015’s Fallout 4 that the team felt more creative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big thing about Fallout 3 was it’s this transitional game. It was the first Fallout we had done. So we wanted to make sure we were really honoring the legacy of the franchise and those earlier games.</p>



<p>We owned it, but owning a franchise and an IP is different than feeling like you own it creatively.</p>



<p>I think by the time Fallout 4 came around we felt more comfortable with like okay, ‘we don’t have to be so reverential now, it’s not all nostalgia, we can create some new stuff.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/bethesda-was-scared-of-making-fallout-3-but-by-fallout-4-it-had-chilled-out-we-dont-have-to-be-so-reverential-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> </em>for the interview quote.</p>



<p>Perhaps Emil is forgetting the creation of Fallout Shelter, which was released just before Fallout 4 and was a pretty innovative and transformative game in itself.</p>



<p>Fallout 3 is seen as being one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a treasure trove of a title that was expanded with stellar drops for months after the game launched, and even today, it remains a fan favorite title. Fallout 4, which is by numbers a better seller than Fallout 3, wasn’t received quite as well.</p>



<p>And in the middle of that, you have Fallout: New Vegas, seen by many as the best Fallout game ever made, which Bethesda <strong>published </strong>rather than developed outright. That accolade goes to Obsidian.</p>



<p>The wider community has mixed feelings about Bethesda’s ‘treatment’ of Fallout over the years. It’s expected that the next major release in the series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">Fallout 5</a>, won’t surface for many years, and for now, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter are the only games in the series receiving substantial updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Quietly Ends Production of the Most Affordable Steam Deck]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has undertaken a shake-up of sorts in the handheld gaming world, nixing production of the most affordable Steam Deck, the LCD ‘OG’ model. It was recently discovered by eagle-eyed gamers that Valve had silently posted a note on the <span>Steam Deck store page, referenc<strong>ing the end of production</strong>, with what was left representing the final stock of&nbsp;</span>the LCD model.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, we were able to add the 256GB LCD model to our basket, but who knows how many are left to purchase in Valve’s supply lines?</p>







<h2 id="h-oled-or-bust">OLED or Bust</h2>



<p>If you want a Steam Deck going forward, you’ll soon need to rely exclusively on the OLED model, which has an entry pricing point of $549 for the 512GB variant. That’s a fair reach over the 256GB LCD model, which boasts a price tag of $399 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Of course, the OLED model is an improvement in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has a bigger, better screen, better networking capabilities, a larger battery, and a *<em>checks notes</em>* longer charging cable, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Valve is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but many expected a cut-price deal to get rid of them, particularly amidst the ongoing Steam Winter Sale and the approach to the festive window. If stock is there to be cleared, then host a clearance sale!</p>



<p>Last year, when discontinuation plans started surfacing, Valve knocked 15% off the price before phasing out the 64GB LCD Steam Deck.</p>



<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s storefront</a> and try to shop for a Steam Deck, you’ll see the small print:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Valve is moving on to bigger and brighter things, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/">recently revealed Steam Machine</a>, a hybrid device that’s supposed to be the perfect combination of a gaming PC and a traditional home console.</p>



<p>It’s slated for a 2026 release, but nobody has the pricing structure for the thing on lock just yet.</p>







<p>Are you hoping that the Steam Deck LCD model gets a price slash so you can scoop one without breaking the bank? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1389454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="0b41a0381cbf6"><a title="Ice Climber - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b41a0381cbf6/ice-climber-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ho, ho, ho, everyone! Welcome to a particularly festive edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-mega-man-6">Last week</a> saw two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man_6">Mega Man 6</a> going head-to-head, and it was a little closer than we expected. The yellow Japanese variant (this writer's favourite) just clinched it, however, taking 54% of the vote and leaving the North American design with the remaining 46%.</p>
<p>This time, as we get ever closer to Christmas Day, we're taking things in a festive and frosty direction, as we match up a trio of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>. Mainly remembered today for its frustrating controls, relationship-breaking potential and <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> fighters, this NES launch title (in North America) remains a cleverly-designed classic, and it's a beauty when it comes to box art!</p>
<p>There are three covers to choose between this week, so get your coat, gloves, and scarf on, and let's go out to meet 'em.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:30823 @ 1766349218 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0098cc938c330"><a title="Ice Climber - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0098cc938c330/ice-climber-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, these North American NES covers really are classics, eh? This one in particular is so dynamic. The leaping sprite, the stretched back hammer swing, the 'will they make it?' platform <em>just</em> out of reach, and the ice-cool polar bear all add up to a pretty iconic image. Don't even get us started on those little snowflakes falling down the black backdrop!</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7d70ae1168584"><a title="Ice Climber - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d70ae1168584/ice-climber-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design opts for something a little different. This cute, cartoon image sees a titular climber leaping up through the ice and giving a nearby polar bear and seal a nasty surprise (not enough for the former to remove its sunglasses, though). It's framed by the same black background that most European NES covers were, but still, it's a neat design.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="5dd003c3ee6fe"><a title="Ice Climber - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5dd003c3ee6fe/ice-climber-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover uses the same design as the European counterpart, but its horizontal box means that it fills the space far better. The grey backdrop is nothing to write home about, but we still enjoy looking at that poor, shocked bear.</p>

Astronauts haven't set foot on the Moon since, so this replica commemorates an important piece of space exploration history.</p><p>When fully assembled, Lego's replica of the Lunar Roving Vehicle measures 15 x 10 x 5.5 inches.</p><p>The bulk of the 1,913 pieces are used to build the large LRV, but this set also has a few modular components that can be detached and displayed separately. One cool aspect with the modular builds is that Lego included display plaques with information cards for the vehicle as well as the three detachable models: Forward Chassis, Lunar Communications Relay Unit (LCRU), and Aft Pallet Assembly.</p><p>The Forward Chassis includes the gyro and odometer navigation unit and the brush that cleaned Moon dust from the vehicle. The LCRU model has the TV camera, communications antenna, and the LRV's battery pack. The Aft Pallet Assembly was used for experiments and features tools such as a drill and shovel, the Traverse Gravimeter, and a rock known as Big Muley, which was actually found on the Apollo 16 mission. The Traverse Gravimeter was used to conduct an experiment on the Moon's composition beneath the surface.</p><p>The LRV has authentic steering, suspension, and wheels. You can display the vehicle upright on its wheels, but it can also be placed upside down by rotating the wheel axles, lowering the seat backrests, and folding the front and back portions. You can see LRV upside down alongside the three modules below.</p><p>Technic vehicle models have place a far greater emphasis on mechanical components than standard Lego sets. You'll find a far larger quantity of non-traditional Lego pieces like pins and beams in these builds. This particular model is recommended for adults or experienced Lego Technic builders.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886" data-ratio="0.40909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886"></a><figcaption>Lego Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (42182)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png"></figure><p>Another Lego Technic space-themed model deal to check out is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Building-Birthday-Imaginative-Independent/dp/B0CGY3ZB29?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">526-piece Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit</a> for $65 (was $75).

<p>But Aspyr "can't announce anything at the moment"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="563f12a46789a"><a title="Tomb Raider: Rise of the Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/563f12a46789a/tomb-raider-rise-of-the-tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Crystal Dynamics</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many shadow drops recently was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Aspyr teamed up with Crystal Dynamics to make it happen, and if you're wondering if we'll see the other two entries in the "Survivor" trilogy (that's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>), we've now got an official comment.</p>
<p>According to Aspyr's product manager Jordon Reese, the "passionate response" from Nintendo fans has apparently given the team "strong encouragement" to consider more. Here's the full exchange about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-updates-planned-for-switch-platforms">the same interview</a> with Nintendo Everything recently:</p><div><figure data-videoid="BvMG4aVuxgs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytBvMG4aVuxgs" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6dee37tnzpgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>This game kicked off the Tomb Raider “Survivor” trilogy, so we need to ask the obvious question – is Aspyr interested in bringing over Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider to Nintendo platforms as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aspyr:</strong> "We have definitely seen this question! We’ve successfully brought back the classic era (I-VI) and now the ‘origin story’ of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms. We can’t announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, there's nothing to announce "at the moment", but this response has supposedly given the developer a chance to continue exploring these possibilities. As mentioned, it's also got a bit of a history now, having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider I-VI</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Aspyr's more immediate focus is to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-updates-planned-for-switch-platforms">release some improvements</a> for Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on the Switch and Switch 2, with Reese adding how the developer wants to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>The same interview also confirmed Aspyr was "committed" to supporting the Switch 2 going forward – with this platform its primary target on the Nintendo front for future cross-platform releases. And as for the chance of existing Aspyr Switch games getting Switch 2 updates, there's "nothing to announce" right now, but nothing is necessarily "off the table these days".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splinter Cell’s Sam Fisher is Back in a VR Extraction Shooter]]></title>

            <guid>1389430</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell fans everywhere have been chomping at the bit for a new game in the series, but Ubisoft has left the franchise to stagnate for more than a decade. It’s getting to a point of desperation for some, especially with talk of the ‘Splinter Cell Remake’ floating around <strong>all the time</strong> with almost nothing concrete to back it up.</p>



<p>However, a recent announcement revealed that Sam Fisher is (kind of) back in an all-new way, emerging in the popular VR extraction shooter, Ghosts of Tabor.</p>







<h2 id="h-ghosts-of-tabor-x-splinter-cell-crossover">Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell Crossover</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted to experience the role of Sam Fisher from a VR-based perspective, now is your chance. In a new trailer uploaded by the Combat Waffle team, it was revealed that an official partnership with Ubisoft has brought Fisher’s iconic garb to the VR shooter.</p>



<p>The ‘Splinter Cell DLC’ allows players to <strong>become </strong>Sam Fisher, but elements like the gruff tones of Michael Ironside will be up to them to emulate.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s coming in the Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<ul>
<li>Karambit Melee Weapon</li>



<li>FN 57 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>MP7 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>Third Echelon NVGs</li>



<li>Third Echelon Tactical Kevlar Vest</li>



<li>Third Echelon Suit</li>
</ul>



<p>Why wait for a new game containing Sam Fisher to surface when you can dress up as him and go on a merry LARP in Ghosts of Tabor, which we once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-tarkov-vr/">dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor is available on Meta Quest, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957780/Ghosts_of_Tabor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC VR</a>, and PlayStation VR, and it’s widely considered one of the best shooters to occupy the VR ecosystem. It has been around for a couple of years, and the folks at Combat Waffle are constantly updating the title with fresh content and tweaks.</p>
