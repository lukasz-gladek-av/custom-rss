            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-the-witcher-3-mod-restores-cut-boat-races/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, modder MerseyRockoff published a new, interesting The Witcher 3 mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>. The mod restores a series of boat races cut from the final game, leveraging the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent release of the REDKit tool</a> made by CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>The modder explained:</p>
<p><em>With the release of REDkit, 100% of the boat race script was found in the game files, which allowed for the restoration process to begin. Only the text and audio files were found; the rest were created from scratch based on CDPR's writing and careful examination of the files. This means that all the conversations, characters, notices, and journal entries featured in the mod were originally written by CDPR but re-created and brought to life by me using REDkit. This The Witcher 3 mod only supports English localization at the time of the release. Support for other languages is planned in a future update.</em></p>
<p><em>There are 4 races (Regattas) in the game now:</em><br>
<em>Novigrad Regatta - Start from the Novigrad Harbor notice board.</em><br>
<em>Oxenfurt Regatta - Start from the Oxenfurt notice board.</em><br>
<em>Helmsman's Dash - Start from the Kaer Trolde village notice board.</em><br>
<em>Rally of the Wrecks - Start from Holmstein's notice board, but the races take place on Faroe.</em></p>
<p><em>You can also go directly to the start location, skipping the notice boards if you know where they are, and speak with the race master/mistress.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3 - Boat Races (Restored with REDkit)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81eJ791XvzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The mod works with the classic version of The Witcher 3 as well as the enhanced 'next-gen' version. The installation process is fairly simple; you will need to copy the downloaded modBoatRaces folder to your The Witcher 3\mods folder. Then, copy the dlcBoatRaces folder to your The Witcher 3\dlc folder. Lastly, check for conflicts with the Script Merger tool, merging if necessary.</p>
<p>To uninstall the mod, simply delete the related folders. However, the modder warns against doing so while one of the boat race quests is active.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Cloud Imperium Games</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A UK employment tribunal has ordered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Citizen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) to pay almost £30,000 ($38,000) in compensation for discriminating against a disabled worker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio was taken to tribunal by senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion (the claimant) after rolling out a return-to-office policy that failed to accommodate his needs as a disabled person diagnosed with autism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The claimant was hired by CIG in 2018 and made the company aware of his disability at the beginning of his tenure. Although he initially worked from the company's office in Wilmslow, the COVID-19 pandemic required staff to work remotely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted in the Tribunal Judgement sent to Game Developer, upon emerging from the pandemic the studio opened a new office in Manchester and sought to relocate its workforce. However, during the pandemic, Ah-Thion found working from home to be more accommodating of his disabilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than move to the Manchester office, the claimant asked CIG for a permanent remote working arrangement. The request was swiftly denied. CIG refused to change its stance despite repeat requests and eventually dismissed Ah-Thion in July 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the tribunal, CIG branded itself as a "start-up" enterprise–despite boasting over 400 employees–and attempted to argue the claimant had suffered from performance issues related to his remote working setup. It also claimed he was unable to meet certain job criteria, such as mentoring junior staffers, when working remotely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The tribunal, however, found "there was no specific issue with the claimant's performance in relation to working from home as opposed to his performance generally." A witness for CIG stated the company was taking a "tougher" stance on working from home, but despite the alleged issues with the claimant's performance, never formally asked him to return to the office.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds that the respondent's concern about the claimant's performance seemed rather retrospective in the sense that whilst the claimant was employed the respondent never formally investigated those concerns," reads the judgment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds that if the respondent had a serious concern about the claimant's performance they failed to give any evidence to suggest why they could not monitor it successfully remotely whilst he was working from home. Normal performance measures, such as performance targets and regular review meetings, could have been dealt with online."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking those points into consideration, along with the claimant's admission that working in-office often left him "exhausted and distressed," the tribunal found that CIG could have made the "reasonable adjustment" of allowing Ah-Thion to work from home permanently. In refusing to do so, the studio was found to have acted in a discriminatory and disproportionate manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds the respondent cannot satisfy us that terminating the claimant's employment was proportionate. We rely on the fact we have found that working from home was a reasonable adjustment which would have alleviated the substantial disadvantage to the claimant. There is no evidence that working from home would have failed to achieve the respondent’s legitimate aim of ensuring the acceptable performance of a senior gameplay programmer," reads the judgment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We find there was a failure of the respondent to understand the nature of the claimant’s autism. It was a condition of his autism that he struggled with his duties to act as a coach, reviewer and mentor to the junior members of the team. The evidence shows that the claimant was struggling to do this when he worked in the office. [...] We find that the respondent has treated the claimant unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of his disability. They have been unable to show that dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim and accordingly the claimant's claim succeeds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CIG has been ordered to pay the claimant £27,748 in compensation. That includes loss of earnings totaling £14,045.31 and £12,000 for injury to feelings.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness&quot;">"Employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer, Ah-Thion said he remains proud of his work at CIG and described many of his colleagues as "great people." He also, however, told us the experience was soured during his last nine months at the studio, where he was "shocked to see how ready CIG management were to ignore my disability and gaslight me about my work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ah-Thion said he feels "vindicated" following the outcome of the tribunal. "I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging. But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing–all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also suggested that some employers might have a "tick-box mentality" when it comes to accommodating disabled workers, "where sending a manager on a two-hour course about a disability is all they need to do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In reality, each disabled worker is different, and the simplest and best course is to talk to them, ideally on a semi-regular basis and outside the normal performance review process–and employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reached out to Kuits employment solicitor Jake McManus to learn how employers in England and Wales can support disabled workers, and how those with disabilities can hold employers to account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained employers have a "legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments in the workplace for disabled workers," and said they must refrain from using a "blanket one-size-fits all" approach when identifying which adjustments should be made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They should tailor the adjustments to that individual and their specific needs. Employers should monitor these adjustments to make sure that they are working and the employee continues to be supported, and be flexible with making further adjustments if required," said McManus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This can be difficult with invisible disabilities such as autism, as it may not be immediately apparent how a condition affects the employee at work, or whether they have a disability in the first place. However, employers cannot rely on ignorance: if there are indications that an employee may be disabled then they should take steps to investigate it further. An Employment Tribunal will not be afraid to hold an employer liable if they reasonably ought to have known of the disability and did not carry out the necessary investigations, which would have ultimately revealed the disability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McManus' advice for workers is to inform employers of their disability when they commence employment. This ensures an employer will have no doubt as to their legal obligations. "If an employee believes that they are being treated less fairly than other colleagues because of their disability, or because of something that is a consequence of their disability, then they should bring this to their employer's attention so that it can be addressed," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Employees should be aware that any workplace policy or procedure that leaves them at a disadvantage compared to other, non-disabled employees, could be discriminatory. In this case, the company’s policy of requiring senior gameplay programmers to work from the office left Mr Ah-Thion, a person with autism, at a disadvantage due to his social interaction difficulties."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to CIG for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The big budget upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be an open-world, massively-multiplayer game, Sega has said. 
</p>
<p>
A new developer interview video published today includes quotes from Sega's team behind the upcoming reboot, as well as brief flashes of in-game footage. There are clips of multiple yellow taxis racing each other - and police cars in pursuit.
</p>
<p>
Job adverts on Sega's <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">recruitment page</a> note that the game is being developed in Unreal Engine, and that Sega has high expectations for the game's success globally. The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-aaa-in-scope">previously described the project's scope as "AAA"</a>, indicating it is placing plenty of resources behind it.

<p>
According to translations of the development team's quotes (the new video, above, is in Japanese),  Sega is currently testing how Crazy Taxi's traditional gameplay works in multiplayer, with unspecified new mechanics. (That's gameplay mechanics, not people with wrenches.) The game's map is once again inspired by the sunny US West Coast, with a play space designed to feel like a theme park (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-crazy-taxi-title-will-be-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-according-to-sega/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Sega's new Crazy Taxi project was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">five fresh titles in classic franchises announced last December</a>, alongside new entries in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage set to arrive over the next few years. (I'm sure Skies of Arcadia is next... right, Sega?)
</p>
<p>
The publisher has said it is aiming to find the next breakout series from its vast back catalogue, after successfully turning its mascot Sonic into a powerhouse brand.

<p>The cut scenes, dug up and reimplemented for the video, would have taken place between Geralt’s showdown with Eredin and the game’s finale at the tower. It's all set in a Niflgaardian camp, and would have included conversations with Yennefer and Emperor Charles Dance, as well as some optional chats and exploration. There’s also a scene - albeit one missing some animations - in which Yennefer betrays the Lodge of Sorceress to the Nilfgaardians in a bid to help Ciri. She lets Triss escape though, font of goodwill that she is.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the discarded scenes, there’s even some extra bits with good old Crach an Craite, who I mainly remember as the bestower of a very-hyped up magic sword with very useless stats.</p>
<p>It’s been too long since I finished The Witcher 3 to say much on whether this was a cut well made, although it does remind me of the granular politicking in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition">The Witcher 2</a>’s closing hours. As great as the third game was, I do mourn for all the plot threads from 2 it left hanging, notably Iorveth and Saskia, and lots of other little details from the final act. Ah, well, can’t have everything, I suppose. Unless there was some sort of extensively powerful tool that let modders just flippin’ <em>add stuff</em> to the game. Imagine it! Why, you could give me back my dragon wife right now! Now!</p>

R. Martin has teased an <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie or TV show.</p><p>In a post on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, the Game of Thrones author wrote about winning awards, and in doing so strongly suggested an adaptation of FromSoftware’s masterpiece is indeed in the works.</p><p>“Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on Elden Ring… I have nothing to say,” he said. “Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum.</p></div><p>As George R. R. Martin stated in the blog post, the famed fantasy author “did the worldbuilding” for Elden Ring, whereas <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-george-r-r-martin-miyazaki-writing">FromSoftware chief Hidetaka Miyazaka and his team “did all the rest.”</a> Now it does indeed seem like an Elden Ring movie or TV series is actually happening, George R. R. Martin will likely be involved in some capacity.</p><p>An Elden Ring movie has often come up as a possibility, with fans pondering how it might be adapted. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">Miyazaki himself revealed recently</a> that he would be open to an adaptation of the studio’s 25 million-selling 2022 action role-playing game, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p>“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p>“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Shadow of the Erdtree has sold wonderfully well, shifting five million copies in just three days.

We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions.

		<p>The world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dustborn">Dustborn</a> is a beautiful, but distinctly dangerous, dystopia. Set in an alternate-history America where California has become a superstate called Pacifica, and where ordinary people have developed a variety of special powers, you take on the role of Pax, a disillusioned Anomal who decides it’s time to find a way out, fighting the system that ignores and constrains people like her. You face the Puritans, a group that is less than happy that you’ve stolen a mysterious item known as The Cargo from them, and who’ve given chase as you embark on a road trip across the country to deliver it.</p>
<p><iframe title="DUSTBORN | RELEASE DATE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbg2T-7twts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We hopped into the fourth level of the game, joining our gang of super-powered peeps as they found themselves abandoned at a lonely gas station. It’s an area that’s rife with Riders, a group of despicable ne’er-do-wells that want nothing more than to beat you up and steal all of your stuff. And probably kill you. It’s not a great place to be stuck then, so it’s up to you to puzzle your way out of a sticky situation.</p>


<p>You do that by exploring the area, locating key items, and following the narrative threads that will help you to a solution. Here it was all about finding a way to carry on with your journey, with at least two options available to work towards. I, naturally, went for one that saw the gas station set on fire and an angry batch of Riders arrive to knock my head in. It was lots of fun.</p>
<p>Action levels are interspersed with Telltale-style moments of familial bonding, and you’re able to chat to each of the central characters, building a broader picture of who they are, what’s going on with them, and why they’re there. Or just discover that they enjoy knitting. That continues through your exploration, and you have to utilise each of the character’s special skills or knowledge in order to move forward. It’s all about getting to know your travelling companions – I’m willing to bet that knitting will turn out to be helpful at some point, though whether it’s to distract an old lady or to tie up a gang member remains to be seen.</p>


<p>You also make decisions along the way that will influence the ongoing narrative, all of which are reflected or retold via comic book recaps. The first of these serve as a prologue to the game, and then for each of the separate chapters as you progress, giving you the sense that this is a wider cross-media creation that just happens to all be in one place.</p>
<p>Dustborn certainly looks phenomenal. It’s little surprise that it turned heads at the Xbox showcase, and when you see it in action it just cements that initial rush of endorphins. This is a comic book come to life, but it’s not a gaudy, technicolour blockbuster, it’s a piece of deftly crafted artwork from a characterful indie.</p>
<p>When you find yourself embroiled in a spot of combat, that comic book aesthetic continues to shine. You can use your skills and those of your friends to knock a few heads together, and Dustborn does a good job of making you feel powerful, even if the combat feels a little clunky right now.</p>

<p>Just like the Telltale games it so closely evokes, some of the interactions between the cast and the different elements of the world don’t always work smoothly, and there’s a lack of pace to the puzzling/exploration sections such as getting Sai to follow Pax as she carries a huge tyre around that limits her vision. Giving Pax’s speed a little nudge wouldn’t hurt, that’s for certain.</p>
<p>I’m thoroughly sold on the story and world that Dustborn are selling us. It looks and sounds incredible, and while the pacing currently feels a little slow at times, I think the end result is going to be a surefire winner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/drive-and-brawl-across-the-divided-states-of-america-in-dustborn-this-august/"><em>Dustborn releases for PC and console on the 20th August 2024.</em></a></p>

</div><div>



            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s most popular mods has now been extended to support the recently-released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC.</p>
<p>The mod in question is the 'Seamless Co-op' mod by LukeYui, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mod-turns-elden-ring-into-a-seamless-co-op-game">first released back in 2022 for the base game</a>. LukeYui has since been hard at work extending the mod to also work with Elden Ring's DLC - which it now does.</p>
<p>A fresh <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description">mod update</a> yesterday now includes working support - though it may not still be perfect. Prior to this update going live, a Seamless Co-op Discord moderator known as Dalvik shared a message from creator LukeYui, stating: "While not perfect, it has reached a state where it can be used to play Elden Ring and the DLC in co-op."</p>

<p>The creator noted they were "aware of some bugs still present" within the mod, but would continue to fine tune things. "The next few days will be crucial so that I can work on fixing any problematic issues quickly should they arise," they said, thanking the community for their support.</p>
<p>Here are the new details for Elden Ring's Seamless Co-Op mod, as shared on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/979042878091329587/979709115116969994">mod's Discord server</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with Elden Ring App Version 1.12, including Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</li>
<li>Completely rewritten code; some old bugs (e.g. enemies falling through the floor) do not occur anymore</li>
<li>Items gained in conversations are now given to all players</li>
<li>Event flags are properly synchronised now</li>
<li>Enemy scaling options have been added:</li>
<li>Player death count is now a player banner option</li>
<li>Have the option to view the current session password ingame</li>
<li>ModEngine 2 compatibility</li>
<li>Matchmaking verification: only people with the same mods will be able to connect to each other</li>
<li>Added invasions (optional)</li>

<p>Elden Ring creator Hidetaka Miyazaki himself is aware of this mod, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-really-doesnt-mind-if-you-play-elden-ring-in-co-op">more than happy with players experiencing the game in co-op</a> - even if it means using mods to buddy up "beginning to end".</p>
<p>"It's definitely not something we actively oppose or want to downplay, wanting to go through the whole game together," Miyazaki said in June, when asked his thoughts on the modding community's efforts to tweak Elden Ring's features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree had a great debut, and reached 5m sales worldwide</a> in just three days of release. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring itself has now shipped 25m units</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-elden-rings-sole-dlc-but-may-not-be-the-series-end">Shadow of the Erdtree will be Elden Ring's only expansion</a>, perhaps the critically acclaimed game will be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off in the future. Writer George R.R. Martin seemed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">hinting at something along these lines over the weekend</a>, anyway.</p>

            <p>The developers of speedy first-person shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> have dropped a big patch for the retro blaster, adding new weapon upgrades and mutators that can change the game's difficulty in piecemeal ways, like making enemies stronger for an added challenge. There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. "We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons," the developers say. But wait, isn't there a slide kick in the game already?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Added kicks!" the shooterfolk proclaim in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4247539099316308007?l=english">the patch notes</a>, under a section that details changes to your characters fists. Huh? "Hit the melee button when you have your fists out." Ah. This shooter is based on Doom, you see. So your fists are equipped the same way as any other weapon, and punching is done with the "fire" button. Before the patch, you weren't able to boot baddies in the bonce while going full fisticuffs. But now you can. That <em>is</em> an improvement, well done.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other tweaks and fixes. The "Hard-boiled" mutator makes enemy soldiers more flanky and firearm-proof, and gives them "other surprises that we will not spoil." The SMG is getting a "Magnetic rounds" upgrade which "increases damage against small robotic enemies". And your supersoldier is now invulnerable for a very short moment at the beginning of a dash. "The first couple of frames while dashing will now make Dawn immune to bullets," say the notes. Other hazards like fire will still hurt you during a dash, and the cooldown has been increased as a trade-off. But still, pretty handy. </p>
<p>I won't go into all the nitty-gritty detail, especially considering I still haven't played this Doom-meets-F.E.A.R. portmanteau of a game. But here are some very important highlights from the changelog.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Gave Koalas a major health buff</li>
<li>Fixed severed heads not bouncing correctly</li>
<li>Blood is now 0.2% more purple</li>
</ul> </blockquote>
<p>If these brief notes do not convince you, Ed has made reassurances that the shooter is pretty slick in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">Selaco review</a>. "For an early access release, Selaco is in a really good state. You've got a lengthy campaign comprising 30 maps and plenty more to go with it," he said. "And everything feels polished - I didn't encounter any hitches or bugs at all." </p>
<p>For now, the devs are taking a holiday, before returning to work on a second chapter. They've previously marked 2026 as a release date for the 1.0 version.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-ps5-pro-performance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Unreal Engine 5 has yet to reach its full potential, but mid-generation refresh hardware like the Playstation 5 Pro could help the engine make the jump in terms of visual quality that many already expected to see.</p>
<p>Answering a question from a fan, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how better console hardware like the rumored Playstation 5 Pro could definitely drive developers to use the full suite of UE5 features, including Lumen and Nanite, delivering higher quality visuals with more stable performance. Even features that are supported by released games could see an improvement. Hellblade II: Senua's Saga, for example, it's one of the most impressive games powered by the latest version of Epic's engine to date, but it only features software Lumen. A Playstation 5 Pro with better specs over the base models, and increased ray-traced performance, for example, could be able to use hardware Lumen and give console players a taste of what is already possible to achieve on PC with much better hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="Are We Starting To See The Full Power of Unreal Engine 5 In Games?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BMGwItchbHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even in its current state, however, the Unreal Engine 5 can deliver some impressive visuals, as highlighted by multiple<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-visual-imrpoevements-not-enough-justify-performance-hit/"> tech demos</a>. The <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/feudal-japan-megapack?sessionInvalidated=true">Feudal Japan</a> demo, powered by UE 5.4, delivers some impressive visuals even at 1080p resolution, but performance at native 4K leaves quite a bit to be desired even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 4080, as shown in a video shared by MxBenchmarkPC on YouTube.</p>

            <p><em>Hello! Eurogamer is once again marking Pride with a week of features celebrating the intersection of queer culture and gaming in all its guises. Things get underway today as James Croft ponders the particular magic of LGBTQIA+ gaming groups.</em>
</p>
<p>Reh is slaughtering Cabal as he battles Destiny 2's Emperor Calus in the heart of the Leviathan. He's throwing grenades at packs of space dogs, headshotting Psions, and double-jumping over flames as his fireteam attempt the tricky shadow realm raid once more. Calus' health is low, and the tension mounts - if they pull this off they'll finally defeat this fiendish boss, otherwise it'll be back to the start yet again. But their rockets fly true, their supers crash into his mechanical body, and - at last! - Calus is felled. But Reh's elation is short-lived. "Wow," says a fireteam member over comms. "I can't believe my first clear was with a faggot."</p>
<p>That was the last straw for Reh. Sick of the homophobic commentary and eager to find a place he would be accepted, Reh took to Facebook - ISO queer Destiny clan! - where he discovered Guardians of the Rainbows, a group founded by two gay men in 2016. He's been involved ever since, graduating to admin and de-facto clan leader. To Reh and many more of its members, Guardians of the Rainbows - which has grown into a thriving international community over the years - is a haven, a safe space away from the toxicity of gaming. But more than that, it's a place of queer joy, and even the source of some of its members' deepest friendships.</p>
<p>I can relate. In December 2022, after 15 years in the US, I returned home to the UK and moved to Brighton on the south coast. I was new to the city, so I did what I've done before when I wanted to meet new people: I found a local gaming store and played Magic: the Gathering. By pure chance, I sat down with Louie who, just after the Covid lockdown, had brought together a few MtG friends he'd met in person and on Grindr (they literally shared deck pics) to create a regular cadre of LGBTQIA+ players. That informal cluster has grown into the group that now calls itself Tragic: the Gathering - and its members have swiftly become some of my closest friends.</p>
<div data-domain="www.youtube-nocookie.com"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A8Jeyfyk4Ck?si=ReXG5q1E89FWrg2n" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p></div>
<p>Louie admits he was initially worried how the group would interact outside the boundaries of the game. "If we're not playing together," he recalls wondering, "do we actually get on?" But we've started to see each other more and more outside our Magic-time, going to the movies, meeting up at the pub, even visiting an improvised Dungeons &amp; Dragons show at the Brighton Fringe together. We've become a community, and it's made me wonder about the relationships that LGBTQIA+ gaming groups tend to foster: why is it that I feel so close to these people even though I've known them for such a short time? What makes these groups feel like home - like family - for so many of their members?</p>
<p>ManicPixyGirl joined Guardians of the Rainbows for much the same reason as Reh. She's trans, and frequently faced harassment and toxicity while playing first-person shooters online. "If I'm playing with random people I generally will keep myself muted to avoid experiencing misogyny or transphobia," she tells me. In Guardians, by contrast, she knows that if anyone says anything out of line, others will call it out. Everyone works to make the space safe for queer people of all types, and it makes all the difference. "I feel safer talking on comms," she says.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/pride-week-2024-james-croft-manicpixygirl.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>James, who regularly plays Overwatch with a group of gay friends, agrees. "Gaming with LGBTQ people feels safer", he says. "There's a lot of hate online - you still get people who say derogatory things." But as a group, it's easier for James' team to confront the homophobia they sometimes face. And although everyone I spoke to had experienced queerphobic harassment while gaming, James says he's noticed allies are increasingly speaking up."You do get quite a lot of people who are supportive in the chat", he observes. "We like to help them out, heal them more or protect them." In this way queer gaming groups like James' Overwatch gang and Guardians of the Rainbows can help make gaming feel safer and more welcoming not just for LGBTQIA+ players but to everyone.</p>
<p>But it's not just about safety. "I find in queer spaces in general there's so much joy," ManicPixieGirl tells me. "We're all able to be fully ourselves. I've experienced it going out to gay bars, and I've experienced it in this clan. Everyone is so authentically themselves and it brings this joy out." And for queer nerds, finding a group which affirms both their queer identity <em>and</em> their gamer identity can feel especially powerful.
</p>
<p>
Lee, a member of Tragic: the Gathering and an up-and-coming MtG YouTuber (one of relatively few openly gay creators in the space) put it like this: "Gay and nerd, that's a bit of a double whammy in life - how many more detractions do you need?" But when he plays games with his Tragic friends he gets to share both of these parts of himself. "I feel pure joy [playing with Tragic]", he says, "because they accept my joy around this hobby because they understand it."</p>

</figure>
<p>Perhaps the joyous exuberance that comes from this double blast of affirmation is the reason why these LGBTQIA+ gaming groups can be so good for non-queer people too. Guardians of the Rainbows, while still explicitly a clan for LGBTQIA+ players, has always welcomed straight cis members. "It's good not to segregate ourselves," Reh explains, "because when we play with allies they stand up for us when they come across things that aren't right."</p>
<p>While the majority of Guardians' clan members are part of the LGBTQIA+ community, it's not uncommon for three or four members of a six-strong raiding fireteam to be straight. I asked Reh if he feared this might impact the nature of the clan, but the group is careful to ensure all potential members understand who the clan is for and the queer ethos it promotes. And if you're wondering why a straight person might want to join an LGBTQIA+ clan, the answer, I think, comes back to that queer joy.</p>
<p>I know from personal experience that a queer fireteam is a <em>fun</em> fireteam, and there's a sort of freeness that rubs off. Reh gives an example: there's a notorious jumping section in the Kings Fall raid in Destiny requiring players to leap from platform to platform while avoiding a series of thrusting pistons. Incautious players can get shoved into the abyss by the pounding poles. "They're very phallic", Reh says, "and the straight guys will make jokes about the 'penis wall'. 'You got slapped with a dick!'"</p>
<p>This might seem like typical straight male ribaldry, but I think something deeper is going on here: the exuberant and unapologetic authenticity of LGBTQIA+ people can, in a sense, liberate straight cis people, allowing them to explore aspects of themselves they otherwise find difficult to fit within society's rigid scripts of gender and sexuality. Thus, LGBTQIA+ gaming groups (like all queer groups) can be spaces where everyone - not just queer people - can be a little freer and more honest.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Yes, our Magic: the Gathering group had a genuine AGM. | <span>Image credit: <cite>James Croft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But perhaps even more heartening are the kinds of genuinely deep relationships these groups so often facilitate - with members even becoming chosen families. James' Overwatch team originally formed as a board gaming group, but they wanted to stay in touch during the pandemic - so they picked up Overwatch as a relatively easy game they could all play together online. And they played <em>every day</em>. "It saved my sanity during a lockdown," he admits - and now his team are some of his closest friends. "Gaming together accelerated our closeness."</p>
<p>It's a similar story for Guardians of the Rainbows. Reh tells me a number of clan members have difficult relationships with their birth families, who don't always accept them for being queer - yet they've found a place for themselves by gaming together. And the community built in Destiny 2 is slowly extending beyond it: after some Zoom meetings during the pandemic, a group of Guardians will soon share a cabin in Michigan, meeting for the first time offline. Reh's excited, but nervous: his social anxiety is kicking in. But the clan has helped him with that, too.</p>
<p>The final word, though, must go to my Tragic: the Gathering friend, Lee. "My real family could not understand me at all growing up", he tells me. "I was a weird arty gay kid in a family where no one understood the weird arty gay kid." For him, "it was a lifeline to find groups where people understand what you're talking about. You spend your formative years feeling so deeply alien, then suddenly shared references make you feel like there's a little group of aliens running around together. I don't feel so alone. I've found more solace in these people I've known for two years than my family I've known for 45."</p>
<p>That's a special sort of closeness - the magic created when queer gamers, sharing both a minority identity and a passion, find each other and say "I choose you!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-are-japanese-developers-not-undergoing-mass-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>On 14th June, <a href="https://x.com/KidTak/status/1801460369971679402">Tango Gameworks employees had a pizza party</a>. It was the studio's final day following the announcement of Microsoft's decision to close the studio behind games like Ghostwire Tokyo and the award-winning Hi-Fi Rush, a decision that surprised many across the industry.</p>
<p>The game had been released on platforms beyond Xbox for the first time mere weeks earlier as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-announces-slate-of-four-titles-launching-on-non-xbox-systems">the company's new initiative to bring their titles to more platforms</a>. As the company's only Japanese studio in <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202310/31321751.html">a region of growth for Xbox and Game Pass</a> after decades of struggling to break into the gaming market in the country, the decision also appeared counterintuitive.</p>
<blockquote>If you focused solely on the Japanese industry, you would be forgiven for forgetting the crisis that has subsumed the wider industry</blockquote>
<p>Layoffs and studio closures have been an unfortunately-common occurrence across the industry since last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">layoffs in 2024 already matching 2023's total of over 10,000 developers</a> being put out of work. Yet if there is one bright spot to find in this bleak reality, it is, ironically, in the same city as the departed Tango. Its closure, undeniably tragic, is an exception in a country seemingly insulated from the industry-wide devastation occurring beyond its borders.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you focused solely on the Japanese industry, you would be forgiven for forgetting the crisis that has subsumed the wider industry.</p>
<p>FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki recently came out to vehemently support his team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-layoffs-at-fromsoftware-wont-happen-as-long-as-this-company-is-my-responsibility-says-miyazaki">no layoffs planned</a>. Konami have once again been growing their gaming business after making a retreat in the 2010s for the land of pachinko, while Capcom have recently raised wages far above the recent inflation stats of 2.5% by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcom-increasing-all-salaries-by-around-5-28-rise-for-new-graduate-hires">increasing base salaries for new employees by 28% starting in fiscal year 2025</a>, one of numerous the company has enacted since 2022.</p>
<p>All this has occurred while increasing employment and development amidst record profits.</p>
<p>And let's not ignore Nintendo, which ever since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/nintendo-satoru-iwata-pay-cut/">Satoru Iwata's 3DS-era wage cut to avoid cutting staff</a> has enjoyed impressive growth, hiring more employees and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/qa2306e.pdf">increasing base wages</a> to make the company more enticing. <a href="https://biz-journal.jp/company/post_358805.html">The company boasts an impressive employee retention rate of 98.8%</a> with an <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/csr/en/esg_data/index.html?active-topics=topics02">average tenure far above the industry average of 14.3 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's a trend across the industry in the country. In my own conversations with Japanese developers, many have acknowledged the concerns for friends in the industry internationally while admitting a level of confidence and job security that simply no longer exists no matter the company beyond Japanese borders.</p>
<p>It's not that the country is entirely immune from strife – Square Enix recently admitted in a shareholder meeting a new change in strategy to target a wider range of platforms for future releases while <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-on-cancelled-games">canceling some unannounced projects</a>. Even then, these cancellations have not been followed by layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-square-enix-to-lay-off-workers-in-european-and-american-divisions">at least in Japan</a>. On the whole, employment is stable and investment is growing, with everyone from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shueisha-games-quest-to-become-the-japanese-devolver">larger domestic companies entering publishing in the independent space</a> to companies like NetEase investing and working with industry veterans and even nation states like the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crown-prince-of-saudi-arabias-foundation-now-has-a-96-percent-stake-in-snk">Saudi Investment Funds buying 96% of SNK</a>, all paint a rosier picture than seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>What's different? Why is Japan seemingly immune to many of the layoffs and trends seen further afield?</p>
<p>While cultural differences play a part in retaining employees, it's not entirely benevolence keeping Japanese employees in a job. Employee protections are also a major factor in ensuring stability for employees. Under Japanese employment law, layoffs are incredibly difficult to implement – unless the company is under severe financial difficulty and at risk of insolvency in a manner layoffs could alleviate, after other cost-saving measures have been undertaken, layoffs for permanent employees are all-but impossible.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean there aren't other ways to reduce the workforce, whether that be in not renewing or canceling work for contract employees. While this is possible, this can reflect poorly on the company's reputation with the public and prospective future employees if employment isn't deemed stable, so is generally avoided if possible.</p>
<blockquote>"It's almost night and day. In Japan, the law protects the employee. In the US, [it] protects the company. For Europeans, it's somewhere in the middle"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Japanese law also prevents many roles from being classified under non-permanent employment. Employment, on the whole, is far more stable and secure than seen in Europe, the US or elsewhere.</p>
<p>As industry analyst Serkan Toto (CEO of Japan-focused games industry consultancy Kantan Games) puts it, "It's almost night and day. In Japan, the law protects the employee. In the US, the law protects the company. For Europeans, it's somewhere in the middle. It's not as easy [in Europe compared to] the US to fire people, but it's also not as easy as in Japan to keep your job once you have it as a full time employee."</p>
<p>When layoffs are so difficult, why was it possible for Tango Gameworks to be shut down by Microsoft in the manner that it was?</p>
<p>"A closure where you lay off people through that method is different than going in and [cutting] that same amount of people and ten people stay," explains Toto. "You have to explain yourself in court, because there will be lawsuits and that's a very difficult case to make as a company. But if you close the entire company outright, get rid of everything inside the company including the staff, office, the rent, the equipment, it's a different story."</p>
<p>Another factor in Japan's strength amidst ongoing turmoil is the fact the country is insulated from many of the issues facing companies elsewhere. <a href="https://gamedevreports.substack.com/p/sensor-tower-mobile-gaming-market-4b7">Outside the United States and China, Japan has the largest market for mobile gaming</a> in the world, with many of its biggest titles like Uma Musume, the recently-launched Gakuen Idolmaster, Puzzle and Dragons, and Dragon Quest Walk being domestically-developed and published by Japanese companies. Other new releases primarily target and seek to make a profit from domestic audiences without relying on global success to turn a profit.</p>
<p>"Mobile gaming is three times bigger than console gaming in Japan," explains Toto. "People outside Japan always think about Sega, Nintendo, and so on, but inside Japan 70% of the market is controlled by mobile game companies. CyGames is a big one, and they're also doing console games now, but then there's primarily-mobile companies like Gree, DeNA, Akatsuki. These companies have 1,500 [to] 2,500 employees, and nobody's talking about them, but these guys also don't fire anybody.</p>
<p>"Mobile gaming is not exploding anymore like it used to about ten, 12 years ago when smartphone gaming came and conquered, but for the last five or six years, mobile gaming in Japan has been quite stable. If you look at the revenue size across the industry, it is not really changing that much, although PC gaming is becoming bigger."</p>

</figure>
<p>Exporting work to cheaper countries is also far more challenging for Japanese developers. Such routes to accomplish this are not only not established, language barriers make communicating with foreign workforces more difficult, protecting domestic labor. This also contributes to the circumstances fueling wage increases, as companies compete for a shrinking working-age population.</p>
<p>"Japan is an island nation where the language is only spoken inside the country and nowhere else – you can't sack 500 Japanese people and then outsource that work to 500 people in the Philippines," as Toto summarizes it. "And the population in Japan is graying and shrinking at the same time, you have less talent. Companies like Bandai Namco, Nintendo, and Capcom are not paying people more because they want to share the wealth, they do it because they have no other choice! Otherwise, these software engineers working at Capcom might go and work for Toyota in the AI business."</p>
<blockquote>"People outside Japan always think about Sega, Nintendo, but inside Japan 70% of the market is controlled by mobile game companies"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Even then, rising wages still doesn't make game development prohibitively expensive in Japan, opening up space for games to fail or companies to take more risk. A lower cost of living coupled with lower average wages compared to those seen in the likes of the US – <a href="https://www.orixbank.co.jp/column/article/189/#:~:text=%E9%9B%87%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%E6%85%8B%E5%88%A5%E3%81%AE%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8E,-%E5%89%8D%E8%BF%B0%E3%81%AE%E5%9B%BD%E7%A8%8E%E5%BA%81&amp;text=%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A%E3%81%A7%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%80%82-,2022%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%88%E4%BB%A4%E5%92%8C4%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89%E3%81%AE%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8E%E3%81%AF,%E5%86%86%E3%81%AE%E5%B7%AE%E3%81%8C%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82">according to Orix Bank</a> the average yearly income in Japan is ¥4.58 million (around $28,000), and <a href="https://hr.geeq.co.jp/tocreator/career/gameprogrammer-income">research from Imagica GEEQ</a> placed the average wage for game programmers at ¥5.23 million (around $32,000) – help reduce overall budgets.</p>
<p>Compared to titles like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Warner%20Bros%20CEO,impact%20the%20company's%20Q1%20performance.">Rocksteady's The Suicide Squad, which reported major losses of over $200 million for Warner Bros</a>, Toto estimates factors like wages mean even the biggest titles in Japan can be produced for "30-40% less, maybe more" than seen internationally, reducing risk.</p>
<p>Morale is low across the global industry, and for good reason. The post-COVID and post-growth shock fueling layoffs means that regardless of the size of your company or talent in releasing critically-acclaimed games, no job is safe in the pursuit of endless growth.</p>
<p>Even companies making record profits deem it necessary to make the line go up further, slashing jobs with abandon. This can be seen with Tango Gameworks and recent Microsoft layoffs: the company had an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/">operating income of $88.5 billion in 2023</a> and increased profits, yet enacted company-wide layoffs including 1,900 under the Xbox brand.</p>
<p>"Nobody thinks about the people who are still working there," laments Toto. "If I was an artist at Ubisoft, for example, I would be scared. Ubisoft is one of the last big companies that haven't pulled out the hammer yet. They've cut some people, but it's a drop in the ocean when you have over 20,000 total employees. Even if you're one of the remaining employees [after a layoff], I wouldn't feel secure at any games company right now."</p>
<blockquote>"Japan is an island nation where the language is only spoken inside the country – you can't sack 500 Japanese people and then outsource that work to 500 people in the Philippines"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Layoffs of this magnitude feel counterintuitive. When so many developers are thrown out of work, the brain drain means many years of experience will likely leave the industry for good, and companies will lose access to the generational knowhow of company workflows and tools new hires will be forced to learn from zero. Growth may have slowed, <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/video-games-in-2023-the-year-in-numbers">but it is still growing</a>, and the industry remains larger than film, TV and music combined. The crushing reality is that, while you can't prevent every job loss, many layoffs are avoidable.</p>
<p>Employees simply <em>must</em> take the hit to add a few extra dollars to the end-of-year shareholder dividend though, right?</p>
<p>Japan's alternative approach has long-term merits in ensuring companies have retained the talent needed to react to any revitalization for the industry, as Toto explains.</p>
<p>"If there's a new bull run in the video game industry, which I think will come, then I think Japanese companies will be in a better position. They have retained their talent, and it builds trust. I fear that Western game companies have overdone it, and there's a danger that if the game industry revitalizes in one or two years that these decisions might come back and bite them.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japan-focused games industry consultancy Kantan Games</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"I think there's a big philosophical difference between the Japanese and the Western world. Japanese game companies really think long term, a lot more long term than their American counterparts. For a lot of the American companies, they are basically characterized by American capitalism, where everything's profit, profit, profit, profit, and if the line goes downward everybody starts panicking."</p>
<p>When the never-ending tide of layoffs finally subside, many developers will have left the industry for good. It will take years to regain that experience, and what's to stop another run of job losses tossing all that progress aside once again? How much strain can the industry hold before it all crashes in on itself? And even if things recover, without a change in mindset, will another collapse in jobs 10 years down the line remain not only possible, but inevitable?</p>
<p>"Will you be able to get the ideas of American capitalism out of the minds of the CEOs at Activision or Electronic Arts? Probably not," ponders Toto as we wind up our conversation. "I think it's always a battle between the American system and the Japanese system, with the American system very much focused on profitability and short term thinking and making everything as efficient as possible, whereas in Japan the thinking is different."</p>
<p>After one last opportunity to share pizzas as a company on Microsoft's dime, Tango Gameworks closed its doors for the last time. Perhaps on some spreadsheet thousands of miles away, the thought of a games company far from home a few years out from releasing a new game is the most efficient way to make the line rise just that little bit further. Not everything of value can be quantified on a graph, nor does massaging one quarter of growth for short-term gain mean the decision won't adversely impact another quarter in the future.</p>
<blockquote>"I think it's always a battle between the American system and the Japanese system, with the American system very much focused on profitability"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>But who cares about that? The line must go up, the concept of endless growth viewed not as an impossibility but a rational objective that must be achieved at all costs. And the people suffer.</p>
<p>It's not even that Japanese companies are all that much different from their American counterpoints. Many are publicly traded, and you can be assured, private or public, they all still love money. In some ways, you can't help but wonder if things would be different if employment protections were different, or if employees didn't benefit from the language barriers making it more difficult to ship their efforts elsewhere. Yet whichever it is, their difference in approach makes the grass much greener for those plying their trade in the country, if just for the fact they aren't as worried about not having their job in a week's time.</p>
<p>Perhaps for now, we should merely take solace in the fact that, in a seemingly-never ending world of layoffs, there are at least some people still in a job.</p>

        <p>Reorganisation within studio has resulted in 33 redundancies</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Ubisoft has announced layoffs at its Toronto studio following a restructure, with 33 staff affected.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/">PC Gamer</a>, the developer announced it had conducted a "targeted realignment" of its team resulting in redundancies, in order to "ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap."</p>
<p>"We are committed to providing comprehensive support to [employees], including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition," it said.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto noted that the layoffs will not impact ongoing projects, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Splinter Cell remakes.</p>
<p>This is the second Toronto-based studio hit by layoffs this month. Last week, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em> reported that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-of-mass-layoffs-at-gameloft-toronto">staff at Gameloft were affected by redunancies</a> due to current market conditions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-hit-with-another-wave-of-layoffs">45 Ubisoft staff were affected by layoffs</a> across its global publishing and Asia-Pacific divisions following a reorganisation.</p>
<p>In its 2023 fiscal year report, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023">Ubisoft recorded a 27% growth in sales</a> to €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) driven by the performance of its Rainbow Siege and Assassin's Creed franchises.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, you sneaky sausage, clandestine chorizo and, possibly, underhand cumberland! In keeping with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>’s tradition of hiding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parry-like-youre-sekiro-with-this-one-weird-trick-that-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-hate">entire new systems behind tucked-away items</a>, a hidden NPC quest in the DLC gives you access to a special raisin that allows Torrent. your steed, to charge your foes with its big fat forehead. A delicious ‘fruit and nut’ bar, if you will.</p>

<p>The Spirit Raisin is an item you’ll first need to grab a certain cookbook to craft, so do have a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-moore-questline-walkthrough">Keira’s guide to Moore’s quest</a> if you’re curious. Craft the raisin, feed it to your spectral steed, and you’ll grant torrent to ability to yackety-smack into foes, knocking them back during galloping. It doesn’t do any damage to speak of, but it does stop you getting mobbed as you saunter about the land of shadow.</p>

<p>Also, it’s just nice to see Torrent getting in on the action. Personally, I’d have added a makeshift saddle with two of those greatbolt jar cannons on either side, but I am not a famous gamesmaker. I am simply a man, looking at a spirit yak, asking very nicely if someone will make a mod that lets it wear a very small mech suit.</p>
<p>May as well go out with a bang, right? Especially as this could be the last time we even get a mount in a FromSoft game, since it doesn’t sound like more open worlds are on the cards for the developer. “Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say Elden Ring is really the limit," Miyazaki <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">said recently</a>. "We’ve tapped every resource and talent that we have access to… scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns."</p>
<p>Ah, but you see Miyazaki, you already have<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon"> Armored Core VI</a>, do you not? Anyone who complains about 'asset flips' when the end result is giving your yak a mech suit is not someone worth taking seriously. It wouldn’t even be the first time someone tried <a href="https://youtu.be/2vO2SOqO7cs">something so foolish, yet so utterly sublime</a>. Until then, at least we have the headbutt raisin. I relate, Torrent, I honestly do. If someone tried to feed me a raisin in lieu of the infinite better snack options available, I'd want to wreck shop too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Would you fancy a movie or TV series based on FromSoftware's latest masterpiece, Elden Ring? Because that seems exactly what George R.R. Martin is teasing in his latest blog update <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p>The author of A Song of Ice and Fire famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-george-r-r-martin-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborated</a> with the Japanese studio on the new fantasy franchise, laying down the mythology, worldbuilding, and characters that the game's plot is based upon. Many had called this a match made in heaven and, indeed, Elden Ring went on to be an outstanding commercial and critical success.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the game even <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won</a> the Nebula Award for Game Writing. The prize, which cited both George R.R. Martin and Elden Ring game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, was shipped to Japan only recently. The author said that's where it belongs since FromSoftware did the heavy lifting on the story after he had prepared the groundwork.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Then, out of the blue, he wrote:</p>
<p><em>Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on ELDEN RING… I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?</em></p>
<p>To be fair, we haven't really heard much in the way of rumors about an adaptation. In fact, Martin's peculiar wording is inevitably going to start its own rumor on the subject, and we can't imagine it was unintentional for a man whose job is to choose the right words. However, publisher Bandai Namco <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-has-sold-over-12-million-units-ip-to-expand-beyond-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> in March 2022 that Elden Ring could expand beyond games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Corporation (which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-parent-company-gets-hacked-will-have-to-pay-a-ransom-to-avoid-1-5tb-of-data-to-be-released-on-july-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked</a>, by the way, and must pay a ransom by today or face the dissemination of the stolen data) regularly produces anime, so it would make sense for the feature film or TV show to be animated rather than live action. The alliance with Sony, <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> three years ago and strengthened last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new investment</a>, might be related to the project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units</a> in the first three days on the market. On PC, fans can also use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated Seamless Co-Op mod</a> to play the whole game with friends.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, everybody! Not going to lie, it's a dry one. Drier than a doldrum dunked in silica gel packets, dustier than Death's doorstep. There are precious few eyebrow-raising new PC games on the cards, but I have swaddled my head in wet blankets, braved the desert and returned with a small handful of dreams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Monday 1st July is a day of immaculate blackness and creepy lo-fi linework, care of space station spook-a-walker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044970/Vorago/">Vorago</a>. Tuesday 2nd July is a time of much free-to-play schlooting, care of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/">The First Descendant</a> - and of much pay-to-play mmorpging, care of <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/product/">Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail</a> expansion. On Wednesday 3rd July there... is... <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2729720/4_in_a_row/">Connect-4, but inside a computer</a>? On Thursday 4th July therrrrrrrrre isssssss... a game literally just called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3054680/Multiplayer_RPG/">Multiplayer RPG</a>? That's like naming your dog "Dogs". And on Friday 5th July, a relatively electrifying shmup called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717610/Void_Reaper/">Void Reaper</a>.</p>
<p>You may not get to play that last one, because odds are high that the Maw, our resident dark god of video game news, will have blossomed in outrage and swallowed the world by Thursday. Please: if you spy any headline-worthy new PC games anywhere, perhaps sheltering from the summer torpor on Itch.io, sing out in the comments. Please. The Maw's shadows are growing clearer and sharper, lengthening like silences. Our generators agonise, struggling to fill the calm. It may already be too late.</p>

    Poor Edwin, eh? Takes a few well-deserved days of, and immediately, an upcoming crowdfunding campaign for a Soul Reaver graphic novel prequel is announced. I guess I'll steal his chance to get excited about it in public for myself then. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-returns-in-new-prequel-graphic-novel">Cheers, Ian Games</a>!

    Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2'S public beta - due in a few month's time - has been cancelled, with Focus Interactive saying they didn't want to take dev resources away from the full launch on the 9th of September.

    I'm off on holiday till Wednesday, but there is yet time for a bit of housekeeping. Perhaps due to the dreadful lassitude, this week's liveblog has frayed away from the timeline and become entangled with last week's. Either that, or Graham accidentally popped Friday's updates in the draft liveblog I'd set up, because I did not tell him I was setting up a draft liveblog. I know which explanation <em>I</em> prefer.

            <p>Happy Monday all! Yes, I wrote that with total sincerity. We all deserve a happy Monday - perhaps video games can help with that. As you'd expect, Elden Ring's recently released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC remains this week's Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 24th June kicks off with bone-throwing dungeon solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/">Dice &amp; Fold</a>. On Tuesday 25th June, we've got the remake of mystical 90s point-and-clicker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">Riven</a> - now with real-time 3D environments, shock - together with magic realist high school visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/">Until Then</a> and Argentinian folk horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2761100/Pomberito/"> Pomberito</a>, in which a farmer must survive five nights while investigating a local beastie. Skipping forward to Thursday 27th June, there's some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807170/Stray_Gods_Orpheus/">Orpheus DLC for RPG musical Stray Gods</a>, and the early access launch of 30 player last-person-stand 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287920/BATTLE_CRUSH/">Battle Crush</a>. On Friday 28th June, there's the early access release of tornado-chasing simulation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a>, which has you monitoring rogue weather on a 625 square kilometre map. </p>
<p>Here at the RPS Treehouse we'll be spending a fair bit of the week feeding the Maw freshly-hewn pieces of Erdtree, but we'll also be running our mitts over a co-op anime shooter I won't spoil, dredging up long-forgotten Aliens games, and possibly finding time for a stylised retro FPS or two. The Maw would typically consider this spartan fare, but there's so much molten Elden Ring DLC running through its cyclopean veins I think we'll get away with it. Even the Maw needs time to digest.</p>

"Scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns," he said. "Perhaps having multiple projects is the next stage, where some of the other younger talent can have the opportunity to manage and direct game design for a smaller project."

    UK retail chain GAME have denied a report that suggested they were planning to stop selling physical games, whatever they are, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/game-reportedly-set-to-stop-selling-physical-games-aside-from-pre-orders">via VG247</a>. Admittedly, I too occasionally feel the spectral pangs of this widespread Mandela Effect, whenever I read a shampoo bottle on the toilet and suffer vivid hallucinations of something called an 'instruction manual'.

    Maw enthusiasts may have noticed that this week's liveblog article is differently styled, with what I hope is a slightly more engaging and transparent headline. The Maw is in a state of evolution - a terrifying time. As such, we especially welcome any thoughts you have about its future in the comments.

<p>In a recent video published by Sega, the team working on the new Crazy Taxi game spoke about pivoting from a core single-player experience to an online multiplayer game built around a vast open-world environment. In the seven-minute breakdown, we’re treated to glimpses of the developing title, which showcased several game modes, vehicles, and some energetic and punchy visuals.</p>



<p>It was explained by the team that there have been some difficulties in pivoting from a single-player experience to a live-service multiplayer model, but they’re making great leaps in the development process as we speak.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crazy-taxi-but-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi – But Multiplayer</h2>



<p>In the video (which you can see below), Sega’s Sapporo Studio talks at length about the city, stressing that it has been designed with realism and a sense of freedom in mind, with players being given a plethora of activities to explore in a ‘theme park-like environment’. </p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="「クレイジータクシー」開発者インタビュー" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLQsitFYpg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In the trailer, there are shots of police chases, stunt-based modes, and general exploration with other players zipping around the world taking on their tasks all at the same time. Sega’s team explained that car design and customisation will also be a thing, and there were shots of artists working on character models, which leans into the suggestion that players might be able to travel on foot. </p>



<p>Ultimately, the video was something of a recruitment campaign, with the various teams working on the game – from art to level design – talking about what they do and how they interact with this developing game. The studio’s head asked interested parties to apply for a job at Sega as the video came to a close.</p>

  <p id="XIrYTo">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 episodes 3 and 4.]</p>
<p id="PY3SUF"><em>House of the Dragon</em> is no stranger to the supernatural. Not only does the HBO fantasy drama series boast plenty of low-key magic — not to mention, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">y’know, <em>dragons</em></a> — but it’s also the prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, a show loaded with snow zombies and smoke monster babies. Clearly, this is a universe where otherworldly forces are at play. Even so, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176417/house-dragon-dunk-egg-game-thrones-connections">Daemon Targaryen’s (Matt Smith) unsettling stopover</a> at Harrenhal in season 2 arguably marks <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s most overtly supernatural subplot to date.</p>
<p id="nZ15rX">Everyone’s favorite sassy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23310439/house-of-the-dragon-sex-scenes-matt-smith-interview">sadboy prince</a> sets up shop at the supposedly cursed castle in episode 3, and strange goings-on start stacking up soon after. It certainly seems like he’s caught up in Westeros’ answer to <em>Ghost Hunters</em>, but is he (and everyone else) just jumping at shadows? Just how cursed is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>’s Harrenhal, really?</p>
<h2 id="tftgxE"><strong>Why does everyone think Harrenhal is cursed?</strong></h2>

<p id="d1hqgl">One of the few things Westeros’ high- and lowborn folk seemingly agree on is that there’s been a curse upon Harrenhal since its foundations were laid. Why? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>books</a>, <em>House of the Dragon</em>, and <em>Game of Thrones</em> chalk up Harrenhal’s dubious reputation to two main factors.</p>
<p id="NijYJh">The first is the Olympic-level arrogance of Harrenhal’s founder, King Harren Hoare, in the lead-up to the castle’s ribbon-cutting ceremony. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/13/18617829/game-of-thrones-scorpions-dragons-strategy-aegon-harrenhal">Harren made a big deal of how invincible</a> his generations-in-the-making fortress was going to be — and, on paper, his boasting made sense. Harrenhal is almost comically supersized, and its battlements (allegedly made from mortar mixed with Harren’s blood) can theoretically shrug off any conventional attack.</p>
<p id="7VYSc4">The bad news for ol’ Harren was that dragons are decidedly unconventional. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23668840/game-thrones-hbo-spinoff-house-dragon-aegon-conqueror">King Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters</a> swooped into Westeros literally the day Harren moved into Harrenhal and promptly torched the joint. The Targaryens’ dragons barbequed Harren and his sons during the assault, and Harrenhal itself was never the same again. Unsurprisingly, rumors that Harrenhal was cursed, haunted, or both sprung up soon after.</p>
<p id="Nj1ekJ">The second factor contributing to Harrenhal’s shady rep is that almost everyone who succeeded Harren as lord of the castle didn’t fare much better. We saw some of this misfortune in <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ eight-season run: Tywin Lannister, Janos Slynt, and Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish wind up shot dead on the toilet, exiled and then beheaded, and Pez dispenser-ed, respectively. <em>House of the Dragon </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365909/larys-strong-house-of-the-dragon-character-explained">season 1 adds Lyonel Strong and his boy Harwin to the Harrenhal curse’s supposed victims</a> as well.</p>
<p id="O18i0G">Frankly, it’s hard to blame folks for believing the place is jinxed!</p>

<p id="SYesBR">Both the core A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>novels and <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23292279/house-of-the-dragon-mushroom-canon">source text, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a>, stop short of showing any outright paranormal activity at Harrenhal. Sure, we hear legends of the fortress’s various horrors, such as the flaming phantoms of Harren and his kids, a child-eating ghoul named Mad Lady Lothston, rafters full of raven spirits, and household staff crumbling to ashes in their sleep. We never actually <em>see</em> any of this stuff, though.</p>
<p id="0QX6xs">At one point, Littlefinger complains about Harrenhal’s ghostly lodgers; however, this is probably just the ex-Master of Coin’s signature snark. Similarly, while various characters (including Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark) acknowledge that apparitions of Harren and his sons supposedly roam the castle’s corridors, nobody actually witnesses this phenomenon firsthand. What’s more, Westerosi rumblings that Harren’s ghost bumped off a pair of Lannister-affiliated lowlifes in <em>A Clash of Kings</em> are flat-out wrong; Arya’s mentor, Jaqen H’ghar, is the one actually responsible. There’s a similarly prosaic explanation for the eerie shrieks that emanate from Harrenhal’s aptly named Wailing Tower: It’s just wind blowing through cracks in the walls.</p>
<p id="neEO4K">Even so, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> also details other, less easily hand-waved supernatural chicanery on Harrenhal’s grounds. Notably, the castle’s Heart Tree not only has a scary-looking face, but also “bleeds” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">from dragon claw marks</a> in its trunk every spring. Admittedly, Heart Trees are a whole separate branch (pun fully intended) of magic in A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>lore, and don’t necessarily fall under the curse umbrella. Yet this definitely fits the definition of “spooky” — and arguably confirms there’s something fouler afoot at Harrenhal.</p>
<h2 id="jOu5ae"><strong>So, is Harrenhal really cursed? Or is that just Westerosi superstition? </strong></h2>

<p id="DvdmOQ">Honestly? No one knows for sure. Ambiguity is a key part of Martin’s take on magic, the supernatural, and religion in A Song of Ice and Fire. As such, the specifics around all three — including curses, real or imagined — is intentionally fuzzy. Harrenhal <em>could</em> be haunted by a malevolent force out to destroy Daemon, but don’t hold your breath expecting <em>House of the Dragon</em> showrunner Ryan Condal to say for sure.</p>
<p id="aMFVe9">Certainly, nothing in episode 3 or 4 categorically confirms or rules out Harrenhal’s curse. Yes, Daemon sees his bedchamber door shaken by unseen forces; however, Harrenhal is drafty as fuck. Our guy’s (admittedly messed-up) visions of younger Rhaenyra aren’t exactly reason to call an exorcist, either. For one thing, Rhaenyra’s still alive (so this <em>ain’t</em> a ghost), and for another, season 2 is littered with clues Daemon is losing his grip. It’s the classic “Is this all in his head?” trope.</p>

<p id="ggfd2a">But even though Harrenhal’s curse remains up for debate in <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2, one thing’s clear: Haunted or not, the castle is Westeros’ least desirable vacation spot. </p>

  <p id="3unrz8">War has officially arrived in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2</a>. And much like the second season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, that means <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/4/12093570/game-of-thrones-map-westeros">Westerosi geography</a> is about to play a much bigger role in the show and our ability to understand it. In fact, the Greens’ war council in this season’s third episode is probably just a preview of the important wartime tactical discussions to come. </p>
<p id="Bu88WZ">The series has never been shy about piling on the details and leaving viewers to piece things together, but with war looming, it’s extra important to keep track of exactly what people are fighting over. So to help get you ready for the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained">Targaryen civil war</a>, here’s a quick explanation of what everyone was talking about in episode 3, and why fighting over the Riverlands is so damn important to both sides. </p>
<p id="WFEbDW">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2, up to episode 3.]</p>
<p id="n7EUqr">The first key to understanding the importance of the Riverlands in the Dance of Dragons is understanding its geographic place in the story. Here’s a map in case you need a refresher: </p>

<p id="fX1Rt0">As we can see, unlike with the season 2 battles between the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones">Lannisters in King’s Landing</a> and the Starks in Winterfell in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there isn’t much distance at all between <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s two Targaryen factions. In fact, all that lies between them is Blackwater Bay on one side and the Riverlands on the other. And the Riverlands practically surround the small islands of Dragonstone and Driftmark, where Rhaenyra and her allies currently reside. </p>
<p id="9fhNsc">Another important facet to understanding the Riverlands is understanding the Tullys. House Tully are the lords of Riverrun, and are traditionally the stabilizing force in the region. However, as Jason Lannister points out in the King’s Landing small council meeting, the Tullys are led at this moment by Grover Tully, an old man incapable of holding his own house together, let alone the rest of the Riverlands as they progress toward open war. This means the region is almost entirely up for grabs, and in very open conflict — as we see at the beginning of the episode with the Blackwoods and the Brackens.</p>
<p id="iddq9a">This power vacuum is exactly what leads Ser Criston Cole, the newly promoted Hand of the King, to the conclusion that he should embark with a small team to the Riverlands by force, bringing the different castles and their lords in line under the crown. To cap off his plan, Criston says that he’ll take Harrenhal, rendering the region completely in King Aegon’s control. </p>
<p id="oLa6cu"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">Daemon</a>, on the other hand, simply flies straight to Harrenhal, deciding that he and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">his dragon Caraxes</a> were likely enough to take the castle by surrender. When he arrives, he learns that he was both entirely right and maybe wasting his time. The dark, damp corridors of Harrenhal are just as ruined as they’ve been since the death of Harren the Black, and the castle doesn’t seem to offer much martial strength at all. </p>
<p id="H2uaPg">Harrenhal’s general lack of strength means that Criston is marching toward an essentially worthless prize, but the allies he picks up along the way are what really matters here. As you can see if you look back at the map, controlling the Riverlands for the Greens would essentially mean cutting the Blacks’ stronghold at Dragonstone off from the rest of Westeros. Sure, they can reach allies by sea, but the only port nearby for Rhaenyra is at Rook’s Rest — which could be another potential Riverlands prize for Criston to win. But without those few cities in the region, the Blacks would be quarantined to their tiny islands and hard-pressed to survive for long. </p>
<p id="qFOiwR">If all this is sounding rather dire for the Blacks, that’s because technically it is. Their side has the strongest navy, which is why Ser Corlys Velaryon is running a blockade at the entrance to Blackwater Bay, effectively stopping shipments from entering King’s Landing. But that’s their only real strength. Of course, if Daemon is able to somehow muster an army at Harrenhal, or bring his massive dragon to bear on Criston’s force, their fortunes could certainly start to shift. </p>
<p id="XTCoJv">But wars are very complicated things, both in real life and in the world of Game of Thrones, and very few of them ever go exactly according to either side’s plan. So, no matter how dire things may seem, there are likely to be a few twists in the near future to keep the conflict close. </p>

<p>On Friday, Twitter users were treated to <em><a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806687243819790723">The Bear The Game</a></em>, a comedy sketch in the form of a first person cooking/life simulation game. It’s also a shooter. It’s also kind of like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. It’s also like <em>Shenmue</em>. At least I see <em>Shenmue</em>. I think most things can be traced back to <em>Shenmue</em>.</p>



<p>Anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">the bear video game actually looks pretty cool <a href="https://t.co/pijrftMFDr">pic.twitter.com/pijrftMFDr</a></p>
— Michael Kandel (@K_A_N_D_E_L) <a href="https://twitter.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806687243819790723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>




<p>Something I love very deeply about the modern internet are interpretations and expressions of game design tropes from people who aren’t dyed in the wool game developers or games media figures. Fashion TikTokers doing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemonxde80s/video/7369623269978410286?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">“Choose Your Fighter”</a> style videos. Elaborate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@panterbanter/video/7150745454437977349?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">physics-bending death</a> animations from <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls.</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmzvcztPoa5/">Point-and-click adventure horror</a> (a real game came out of her stuff, although she eventually dropped out and <a href="https://airdorf.itch.io/excuse-me-sir">only the demo remains</a>).</p>



<p><em>The Bear The Game</em> is just the latest, and <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-bear-the-game-a-review/">perhaps most elaborate</a>, version of this trend. Michael Kandel and Joe Miciak make sketch comedy together as Hotel Art Thief, but the 3D animation seen in <em>The Bear The Game</em> hasn’t always been part of the process.</p>



<p>“We both were unemployed/underemployed and started writing sketches together to pass the time,” Miciak told VGBees via Twitter DM about Hotel Art Thief’s genesis. It wasn’t until 2022 when Miciak began experimenting with Blender, a free 3D modeling tool, for a sketch called “Drench.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">user:Brian(box) <a href="https://t.co/M6qP9BLbZu">pic.twitter.com/M6qP9BLbZu</a></p>
— Michael Kandel (@K_A_N_D_E_L) <a href="https://twitter.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1687461636012158976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2023</a></blockquote>




<p>“It was really half-baked,” said Miciak of this first attempt at creating 3D animated faces. It wasn’t until “user:Brian(box)” in 2023 that Miciak got comfortable crafting 3D heads and placing facial textures. “It’s a chatroom sketch Mike (Kandel) wrote during (the Covid) shutdown,” Miciak recalled, which originally was envisioned in 2D with ASCII art — “I eventually learned how to make the heads, and decided to make it more of an N64 aesthetic.”</p>



<p>You might recognize some of the environmental art from the sketch, as well, which was lifted directly from Nintendo 64 classic <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Even though Miciak has gotten comfortable and confident enough to make sketches using Blender, he’s not a big fan of the software itself.</p>



<p>“Mike will sometimes come up with an idea for a sketch involving 3D objects, and can see me debating with myself whether I want to subject myself to it,” he admitted, “But I break pretty easily.” For <em>The Bear The Game</em> and other sketches with 3D heads featuring facial textures, Miciak uses FaceBuilder, a popular add-on for Blender.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Mike helped out by taking a bunch of screenshots from <em>The Bear</em>,” he explained, “and I did some photoshopping to make sure all the angles were roughly the same color temperature and in the same outfit.” That process of plastering the different-angled photos to the models is fairly automatic, though it’s not perfect by any stretch. “I did some texture painting in Blender to fix any glaring issues,” he noted, “but as you can see in the video, I kind of like when the faces look a little fucked up/asymmetrical.”</p>



<p>Once the faces are (mostly) in place, the animation process can begin. Animation is all about keyframes, anchors in time where all the parts of an image have to be to create movement. Fortunately, tools exist that facilitate this often painstaking task. One of those powerful tools is Live Link Face, a mobile app created by Epic that records video then sends keyframe data back to a program like Blender.</p>



<p>“So Mike recorded all the <a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806710629840851362">actors’ audio</a>, and I got my Andy Serkis on and read all their lines to my iPhone,” said Miciak. In case you’re envisioning elaborate and expensive motion capture equipment on a sprawling Hollywood soundstage, Miciak quickly dispelled the notion. “I was running out of time at the end, so I was on the subway taking these weird videos of myself.” The whole thing came together in about three weeks and was timed perfectly for the Season 3 premiere of the show.</p>



<p>Clearly the duo understand <em>The Bear</em> and cooking tropes enough to create an incisive and thorough parody of one of television’s most lauded shows, all the way down to the much-discussed needle drops like the <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/let-down-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">cover of Radiohead’s “Let Down”</a> that hits toward the end of the sketch.</p>



<p>Even in the music choices are a signpost to the games and moments that inspired the aesthetic and mechanical qualities of <em>The Bear The Game</em>. Both major tracks in the “demo” are covers of 90s songs with Nintendo 64 soundboards by artist on4world — the aforementioned Radiohead song as well as the super ambient <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/rhubarb">“Rhubarb” by Aphex Twin</a>.</p>

<p>Miciak mentioned licensed games from the PlayStation 2 era as strong influences on this style, listing <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, and the <em>Batman Begins</em> movie tie-in as major contributors. This era represents “games that really try to lazily shoe-horn plot from the movie into the game, to the point where it gets distracting” to Miciak. Arguably the most interesting of these inspirations is <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, a game happening parallel to the events of <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em>, which struck a chord with Miciak.</p>



<p>He recalled that “you only get to play a vague, random character <em>[editor’s note: I know Jada Pinkett Smith’s Niobe isn’t random but I get this 100%] </em>and you’re sort of like ‘But… I just want to play as the main character?'” Playing around the events of the popular film released simultaneously was an ingenious and, often in hindsight, deeply interesting move, but it was also a big swing! And this was part of what inspired the character select screen of <em>The Bear The Game</em>, which has you inhabiting original characters that will interact with the ones you’re far more familiar with from the show’s story. This creates a tension from the outset by putting yourself in a place you don’t really feel like you belong.</p>



<p>I think these specific examples serving as a reflection of what could have been if television and film tie-ins continued with this trajectory is fascinating. I also love learning about what people latched onto that aren’t in our specific bubble; often too close to every new release and cultural moment that we lose sight of what millions of people who come in contact with games actually remember and hold onto.</p>



<p>“I have a long history of watching my friends play video games because I was so bad at them,” Miciak concluded. “Maybe that’s why I like making fake ones so much.”</p>

            <p>Listen up, Tarnished - Elden Ring worldbuilding writer George R. R. Martin has given his strongest hint yet that the critically acclaimed game may be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off.</p>
<p>Whilst Hidetaka Miyazaki has only teased that he and FromSoftware would be open to a live-action adaptation, Martin goes just that little bit further courtesy of his the-lady-doth-protest-too-much-me-thinks protestations he recently shared on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/">personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>Is it concrete proof an Elden Ring movie or show is on the way? Not even slightly. But it's hard to imagine someone as prolific and revered as George R. R. Martin would put <em>anything</em> in his blog that he didn't expect ravenous fans to dissect and overanalyse, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide</a>, in just three days of release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring had shipped 25m units</a>, meaning 20 percent of all players have already jumped back in for the DLC in its opening weekend.</p>
<p>"To the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella, we extend our heartfelt gratitude," FromSoft said in a celebratory social media.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported that one savvy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> player believes they've found a way to find enough <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-player-shares-how-to-level-up-scadutree-blessings-without-fighting-a-single-boss">Scadutree Fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24189436/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-final-arc-movies-trailer-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="l5lIXr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22933948/demon-slayer-entertainment-district-arc-history"><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em></a> just wrapped its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979916/demon-slayer-season-4-everything-we-know">Hashira Training arc</a> but the (Mugen) train isn’t slowing down: on the heels of the finale, Crunchyroll that <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s next arc, Infinity Castle, will roll out in theaters as an “epic trilogy of films.” In a news release, Crunchyroll notes that “the three-part cinematic movies represents the final arc and culmination of the hugely popular award-winning anime shonen series.”</p>

<p id="YPPM2c">Based on the manga series by Koyoharu Gotoge, published under Shueisha’s Jump Comics, <em>Demon Slayer</em> currently consists of 23 volumes that have sole upward of 150 million copies, a number that turned it into one of the most popular anime on the planet. For Crunchyroll, nabbing the worldwide distribution rights (excluding a few Asian territories) to <em>three</em> additional Demon Slayer films is a major boon; the 2020 film <em>Mugen Train</em> remains the highest-grossing anime movie of all time, the highest-grossing Japanese film at the global box office of all time, and the second-highest grossing anime film in U.S. box office history (having earned $49.5 million, more than <em>Madame Web </em>made in 2024!). Sony’s recent acquisition of the Alamo Drafthouse theater chain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177134/sony-alamo-drafthouse-theaters-purchase-crunchyroll-anime">expressly for the purpose of platforming anime films in America</a> makes the trilogy a major milestone in Crunchyroll’s campaign to be a one-stop shop for all things anime in the U.S..</p>

<p id="IXncEa">After training with the Hashira in the previous arc, <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s majin protagonist Tanjiro is off to the Infinity Castle to take on Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King. A teaser for the movie trilogy is light on footage from any of the Infinity Train films — it’s light on animation in general — but it gives fans who only know the anime a taste for what’s next.</p>
<p id="A6GqgG">The untitled first Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle movie is currently undated. All of <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is streaming on Crunchyroll.</p>
