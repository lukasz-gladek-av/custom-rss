            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-sales-reach-2-5m-as-revenue-climbs.1304256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to new sales data,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has racked up quite a few sales for itself since launching earlier in September, and it's making a pretty tidy packet for its developer and publisher as well.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-amasses-over-25m-players-since-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, data firm Alinea Analytics says that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold over 2.5 million copies since it was released on September 12th, resulting in revenues exceeding $150 million. That's a pretty impressive set of figures.</p>

<p>Alinea's data claims that around 1.3 million of the game's sales were on PC via Steam, and that over a million players have picked up&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on both console platforms on which it's available. Honestly, that's a much more even split than I was expecting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=uV9qzfHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=cH0_nZ62 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want some demographic breakdowns, Alinea has those as well. Over half of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on PC is based in the US, and the next most popular regions are China, Germany, the UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>However, on PS5, the story is a little different. Again, more than half of the game's players on PS5 are in the US, followed by the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Alinea doesn't provide data for Xbox Series X|S players.</p>

<p>According to Alinea's data, 59% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players on PC played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 2</em></a>, while 55% played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-3" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and just 22% played the spinoff title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" rel="nofollow"><em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those figures are higher on PlayStation; as Alinea points out, previous&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>games have been made available as part of PlayStation Plus, so 81% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on the console has checked out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s strong sales performance comes despite widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC, which prompted Gearbox head Randy Pitchford to launch into an impassioned (and lengthy) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">defense of his game on social media</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's comments, 2K and Gearbox have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game's PC version</a>, calling it their "top priority". Presumably, doing so will lead to even more sales for them.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is the newest entry in Konami's long-running survival horror franchise, tasking players with navigating the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan as they attempt to uncover the mystery of a creeping fog that has produced bloodthirsty monsters around every corner. With this change in setting, Silent Hill f manages to be a great onboarding spot for series newcomers while maintaining plenty of familiar themes long-time players will recognize. But whether you're new to Silent Hill or a returning fan, you'll probably want to know how much playtime you can get out of this horrifying adventure. So, here's how long it takes to beat Silent Hill f.</p><h2>How long is Silent Hill f - Campaign length and replayability</h2><p>An average playthrough of Silent Hill f should take <strong>between 12-14 hours on Hard (normal) difficulty</strong>. This includes time spent solving puzzles and exploring at least some of the game's optional paths for additional healing items, upgrade materials, and weapons. However, those looking to advance through the campaign with less resistance can use the Story (easy) difficulty to reduce the combat and puzzle challenges, potentially allowing for a quicker completion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill f - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f is a game designed to be played multiple times, though. While you can beat the game just once if you wish, additional playthroughs--which let you carry over your health, stamina, and sanity upgrades--unravel even more story content. Not only do subsequent runs provide fresh cutscenes and boss changes, but they also provide the opportunity to see up to 5 total endings, revealing more and more of the unsettling story surrounding main character Shimizu Hinako.</p><p>Additionally, completionists will find that there are quite a few reasons to keep playing the campaign through multiple times, as getting every trophy or achievement won't be possible in a single playthrough. You'll need to continue into NG+ to keep earning consumable currency known as Faith so that you're able to purchase all the upgrades and omamori (accessories). And any one-off trophies or achievements you missed your first time or two through can always be tried again on a new run.</p><p>With so much replayability, Silent Hill f can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to survival horror enthusiasts. If that sounds like something you're eager to dive into yourself, you can pick up Silent Hill f now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

                <p>Actor Steven Ogg played a major role in GTA 5, bringing the favorite character Trevor to life.

<p>Instead, Ogg said he prefers books. He encouraged people to read Crime and Punishment from Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p><p>"Someone said, 'At some point, you should play GTA 5.' I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well, one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.' And then he went completely blank. Books are my thing," he said.</p><p>Ogg has previously discussed his inability to play video games, saying at one point he tried, but kept failing to progress and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tYo-zfFngfI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept ramming into a wall with his character.</a></p><p>Ogg was said to have<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891"> recorded lines for a James Bond-like story DLC for GTA 5</a> that would have seen Trevor going undercover. However, that add-on obviously never happened, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">it was reportedly scrapped because of the success of GTA Online</a>. He's also said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">hopes Trevor shows up in GTA 6 so the character can be killed off.</a></p><p>Ogg is best known in gaming for GTA 5, but he's also known for playing Simon in more than 20 episodes of The Walking Dead. He also had a recurring role in the Snowpiercer TV series and was in a pair of Better Call Saul episodes as well. Ogg is also known for his <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steven-ogg-old-spice-commercials-indie-films-1235116757/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">series of absurd Old Spice commercials.</a></p><p>The actor had roles in the video games Alone in the Dark (2008) and Cursed Mountain (2009) prior to his breakout success as Trevor in 2013's GTA 5. He hasn't done another video game since, however.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game stars Jason and Lucia, but Rockstar has not yet announced the actors playing those lead roles. Check out the gallery below to learn more about Jason, Lucia, and all the other main characters in GTA 6's story.</p>

            <p>This year has marked Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date", according to ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, Charla discussed the current state of the subscription service in the face of recent criticism, noting positive sentiment from developers and a desire to return for future projects.</p>
<p>"The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service," said Charla. "As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Xbox has received criticism for Game Pass in recent months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-studios-founder-calls-game-pass-unsustainable-model-and-one-which-is-damaging-the-industry">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a> described the service as "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade".</p>
<p>In a back and forth on social media on the "cannibalisation" of sales, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse added "smaller teams with new or riskier" games can benefit from Game Pass, but he prefers "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" method of adding games following initial sales.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden discussed the perceived profitability of Game Pass in a discussion with <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "There's a lot of debates going on," he said. "Is Game Pass profitable? Is Game Pass not profitable? What does that mean? That's really not the right question to ask anyway.</p>
<p>"You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to. You take enough costs out and say that's off the balance sheet and, oh look, it's profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how">Football Manager boss Miles Jacobson recently told Eurogamer</a> player numbers for the series have skyrocketed since being added to subscription platforms. </p>
<p>"We built a whole business model around it," he said. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place."</p><p>In a broader interview with Eurogamer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">state of indie games on Xbox</a>, Charla noted the breadth of games showcased by Xbox at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>. "It is just really a recognition by Xbox of the absolute crucial need for diversity in our portfolio," he said.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-info</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-info-about-canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-surfaces-including-images-and-more.1304223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have emerged regarding The Initiative's canceled&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, including some of the locales the game would have taken you to and what kind of gameplay systems it would have offered.</p>

<p>Back in July, as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider Microsoft layoff wave</a>,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a>, and developer The Initiative's doors were closed for good (and that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">wasn't the only casualty</a> of those layoffs either).</p>

<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st</a>&nbsp;details what kind of game The Initiative was working on, and it turns out that the studio was looking to fill a niche left open by the absence of newer&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>games. As MP1st points out, it's a little ironic that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">both</a> of those franchises are now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">active</a> and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>isn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=2PdYYkAJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=ws5FK6Qf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No, that 2024 Xbox&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>trailer wasn't fake...mostly.</figcaption></figure><p>The report, which uses material obtained from "a former developer" on the project, also clarifies that contrary to rumor, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">2024 Xbox showcase</a> trailer for&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>wasn't fake. Despite containing "fake stuff", the trailer did show a demo that was internally playable.</p>

<p>According to MP1st's report,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a variety of locales around the world, including the likes of Cairo. They'd have been depicted in an aesthetic internally referred to as "eco sci-fi", marrying futuristic visuals with green tech.</p>

<p>Additionally, one major gameplay system, the Adrenaline System, is detailed in the report. Apparently, Adrenaline would have been a resource that players built up over time, allowing access to skills like healing, reducing incoming damage, and more.</p>

<p>The report claims that the material featured within was intended to be part of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>'s "Season 1", which, as MP1st points out, could well lend credence to the idea that the game was intended to be episodic at one point.</p>




<p>Of course, all of this is moot given that&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>was canceled earlier this year, but who knows? Maybe some of the material in this report will make its way into another Xbox project somewhere down the line. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza / Mario Odyssey Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d91b0cb478cbd/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-odyssey-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the second Nintendo revealed Pauline was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a timeline theory began to take shape in our heads. But then we wrapped the game up, and our prequel presumptions weren't as nailed on as we'd expected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official answer for how Bananza Pauline is related to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Pauline, and according to producer Kenta Motokura, we ain't going to get one any time soon.</p>
<p>This stems from a recent <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3lzbwv3as5c2w">@Stealth40K</a>), in which some of Bananza's key creatives sat down to chat all things DK. The answers cover many of the same topics we saw in the game's Ask the Developer series, but the question of Pauline's timeline is a newbie — albeit one that was somewhat brushed aside.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4hjixsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>When asked about Bananza Pauline's connection to Odyssey's New Donk City mayor, Motokura deftly dodged the topic, saying (via Google Translate), "That's... Of course, the developers have a plan for it, but I'm sorry, but I'd like you to use your imagination". <em>Gah</em>! And there we were, thinking an answer was on the horizon.</p>
<p>And what about that Grandma that 13-year-old Pauline brings up so often in Bananza's Getaway naps? There must be a connection there, right? "Sorry, this too", said Motokura. <em>Double gah</em>!</p>
<p>Now, that little tease of the developers having "a plan" for Pauline's heritage has us wondering if we're going to return to this timeline topic again in the future — we'd be amazed if we don't get another 3D DK game somewhere down the line. Alternatively, of course, Motokura could just be implying that the dev team has their theories, just like we all do, but we're never going to hear 'em. The latter seems all the more realistic, knowing Nintendo.</p>
<p>Okay, so Nintendo isn't going to spill the beans on this one just yet, but that doesn't mean we can't keep on theorising. Don't worry, we won't spoil the end of Bananza here, but if you want to read all about the game's finale and how we reckon it may/may not tie into Odyssey, you can find a full rundown in the guide below.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s hitherto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">beta-only update 1.0.28650</a> is now a fully public release that any dang fool can download without switching to a Steam playtest branch. I'm still noodling my way through the lower levels of Team Cherry's new metroidvania, blissfully unbothered by any pressure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review it</a> or write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong walkthroughs</a>. As such, I asked our reviewer James to have a look at the patch notes and pluck out any important changes, based on his many, many hours in Pharloom. 
</p>
<p>
A shadow glided over James's face, then returned and took up residence in one earhole. Wordlessly he outstretched a gnarled finger towards item 3 on the list: "Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Thus my introduction to the Savage Beastfly, an optional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">Silksong boss</a> that has two iterations. I've now done some background reading on Savage Beastfly and - inasmuch as it's safe to extrapolate from all-caps forum posts - it appears to be Silksong's most-hated NPC. Not simply a challenging fight but a crushingly unfair and unpredictable one, in the eyes of many players, with complaints lodged against everything from the inconsistency of the creature's hitbox, its two-mask damage output, its habit of summoning minions, and the whiteknuckle RNG effect of mixing all these things together.</p>
<p>It doesn't even look that good, the detractors howl. It's not like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's just a mallet with wings. Nobody wants to Rule 34 that thing. Well, some people probably do, because that's the point of Rule 34, but this particular intersection of masochism and formicophilia seems like a rare gift, indeed.
</p><p>
And all of this merely describes the first iteration of the boss. The second introduces lava and destructible platforms, just for funsies. As such, the now-fixed technical issue above with the Savage Beastfly diving into lava and never returning could be styled a positive. Let the bastard stay in the magma, if it loves magma so much. Let it burn forever in a hell of its own creation.
</p>
<p>
The loathing is so extreme that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fucksavagebeastfly/">a whole subreddit dedicated to Savage Beastfly</a> and all its works, with 34,000 weekly visitors. Be warned that the subreddit contains a lot of fake reporting about undiscovered, even tougher Savage Beastfly variants, because if there's one thing Silksong players like doing, it's rustling each other's jimmies.
</p>
<p>
While the Savage Beastfly does appear to savagely beastfly in the face of sporting boss design, I do inevitably wonder whether a piss-boiling abomination like this is a marketing asset for a game such as Silksong. Bosses that are merely 'good' and 'well-designed' don't tend to attract dedicated subreddits. Malenia doesn't have one, as far as I can tell. Nor do Giygas, Psycho Mantis or Sephiroth. I'm surprised I haven't seen Savage Beastfly cited more in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk">the on-going discussion</a> of whether Silksong's overall difficulty is key to the mood, or just contrived.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the full patch notes are below. They are essentially unchanged from the beta test last week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes. </li>
</ul>

            <p>The now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot had an "eco sci-fi" aesthetic, an Adrenaline System, and may have been released episodically.</p>
<p>That's according to internal documentation from a former developer on the project at The Initiative shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">mp1st</a>, revealing new artwork and gameplay details.</p>
<p>The document highlighted an opportunity to capitalise on the secret agent genre, due to the absence of Metal Gear Solid and James Bond 007 during development. Ironically enough, both franchises have since returned.</p>

<p>This may somewhat point to why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark was ultimately cancelled</a> - perhaps this reboot of the N64 classic from Rare wasn't able to differentiate itself enough.</p>
<p>Still, this newly unearthed documentation - which dates back to a period close to the game's cancellation this year - hints as to what players could have expected. The creative vision for the reboot aimed to reimagine the franchise while retaining the core DNA of the N64 original, with the HBO series Westworld providing inspiration for giving a classic property fresh themes and concepts.</p><p>While several systems are briefly mentioned, only the Adrenaline System is detailed. This would've been a resource regenerated over time to provide various abilities like healing and increasing damage dealt, as well as slowing time to aim with precision. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession would have extended this effect.</p>
<p>Until April of this year, the studio was working on a vertical slice (a playable proof-of-concept) that belonged to "Season 1", suggesting the game would have been released episodically.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was properly revealed at last year's Xbox Games Showcase, with in-game footage of protagonist Joanna Dark exploring a futuristic Cairo (above). Later,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v"> reports suggested this gameplay was fake</a>, though a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z">designer on the game responded</a> it was in-engine despite "some fake stuff in it".</p>
<p>The new documentation includes further artwork for the game, including an alternate design for Joanna, as well as various futuristic environments to show off its "eco sci-fi" aesthetic.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was cancelled back in July, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">layoffs across Microsoft</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild was also cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Dropping two days earlier on other platforms</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Windwalk Games and Team17 have announced that the release date for their upcoming co-op roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sworn">Sworn</a>, has been shifted from 25th September, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> Day™, to 23rd September on PC and (other) consoles, with a Switch version due to arrive at "a later date."</p>
<p>This colourful roguelike from "a team of veteran developers from Riot Games, Niantic, and Blizzard" takes inspiration from the art of the legendary Mike Mignola, has been available on PC in early access since February, where it's gone down very well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1763250/SWORN/">sat as it is on a very positive rating</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's a <em>very</em> similar-looking affair to Hades 2 , so we can't really blame Team17 for shifting the launch date to give version 1.0 a little breathing room. But Sworn also offers something of its own, with up to four-player co-op available for you and your pals to dig into while exploring a cursed Camelot.</p>

<p>Here's some official info about the game, and we'll be sure to let you know when the Switch date is set in stone. Like a big sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose to play solo or with friends, summoning the blessings of the Fae Lords in this action rogue-like set in a cursed Avalon. Only through your mastery of unique weapons, many ability options and the help of powerful allies such as Merlin can there be hope for realm. Coinigh dó neart leat! Sworn encourages players to be versatile in the ever-changing battlegrounds of Camelot and to do whatever it takes to halt the grim plans of Arthur and his dishonourable Knights. <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Solo and Co-op<br></strong>Play solo or unite with up to 4 friends to stand off against the Knights of the Round Table. Choose from 4 characters: Vigilante, Rook, Spectre, and Monk and combine the strengths of each character in surprising ways and master abilities to become knights worthy of standing off against Arthur himself.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a foredoomed Avalon</strong><br>
Meet familiar friends and foes inspired by myths and Legends, in this beautifully crafted comic world, inspired by the work of American artist Mike Mignola.</p>
<p><strong>Power divine from the Fae</strong><br>
Swear fealty to the Fae Lords and choose from over 200 unique blessings to unleash your full potential. Will you avail of King Oberon you fury bonuses and damaging whirlwinds or perhaps Banshee Cliona’s aid of soul missiles.</p>
<p><strong>Creatively conquer Camelot</strong><br>
Combine your blessings with unique character, weapon, and ability selections. Test thousands of unique builds as you become a seasoned knight.</p>
<p><strong>Become worthy</strong><br>
Upgrades from the Beacon of Avalore will forge your squire into a worthy champion over time. However, if you believe you are already worthy of facing Arthur, get ready for a challenge that will put your skills to the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/09/two-games-are-available-early-this-week-with-xbox-game-pass-september-22-23#sworn-series-xs-pc-cloud-september-23">our sister site Pure Xbox</a>, Sworn is dropping on Game Pass Ultimate tomorrow, too — another place to check it out if you can't wait for that 'TBA' Switch date. Team17 is putting the game out physically on Switch, so watch this space.</p>

In the Natural History Museum, no less!</p>
<p>From <strong>26th January to 22nd March 2026</strong>, the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop will be getting a Pokémon twist, stocking exclusive collaboration products including clothing, plushies, accessories and more. Many of these products have been made specifically for the collaboration, so expect to see more than a little historical flair in their designs.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fozvirw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, this is a Pokémon pop-up that we're talking about here, so the event will be ticketed. You'll be able to pick up a <em>free</em> ticket to the shop from the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">Natural History Museum website</a> from <strong>1st October</strong>, and you can register for the priority list right now.</p>
<p>Products from the Pokémon x NHM collection will also be available via the museum's online store, and a selection will be added to the official Pokémon Center UK website in January.</p>
<p>It may not be a Pokémon <em>Center</em>, as such, but we're always excited to see more Pokémon shopping opportunities come to Europe. Let's just hope that things go a little smoother than they did in the Louvre back in 2023.</p>

            <p>Hello reader who is also a player! Once again I have failed in my fervent efforts to meddle with the Earth's rotation so as to suspend time exactly at 11.30am, Saturday morning. I fear that another week is upon us. Fortunately, it contains some new PC games, spanning full releases and early access launches. Some of those new PC games may even be worth a modest portion of your lifespan and personal capital. Here's a list of the ones I find most appealing or notable.
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 22nd September</h2>
<ul>
<li>Amplitude's new 4X strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a> begins its career in Steam early access.

</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 24th September</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let's all go be Japanese high schoolgirls from the 1960s and slice up yokai scarecrows in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, which Oisin says is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">decent</a></li>
<li>Let's all go come-of-age in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/consume-me">Consume Me</a> (pictured), a life sim about feeling "stupid, fat, lazy, and ugly in high school", with mostly bad endings</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> does not contain any schools or self-loathing, but it <em>is</em> thinking with portals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 25th September</h2>

<li>Drown human scientists in the ichor of your mass-produced minions in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2908500/Buggos_2/">Buggos 2</a>, an RTS autobattler for the Zerg appreciators lurking amongst us</li>

</ul>
<p>Aside from the above new PC games, this week will contain a non-zero quantity of games so new they aren't even released yet. We'll hear about a few of them at the latest Tokyo Game Show, which runs 25th-28th September. As I write this I am looking at a spreadsheet of embargoed announcements. The temptation to just paste the whole thing below and take the week off is fierce, but I am absurdly professional and will resist. Pretty sure none of you care about <span tabindex="0">made you look!</span> anyway.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/96bd22c62b48c/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with the latest look at the UK physical gaming chart, and, surprise, surprise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is back at the top of the pile.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 launch title hit a speed boost this week and cruised past former champion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> to take the top spot. It was a short-lived triumph for Gearbox's latest, but we're sure the Nintendo release in a couple of weeks will help bolster the numbers</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> sticks around in third, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is <em>somehow</em> the fifth best-seller, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky: 1st Chapter</a> makes its chart debut at 19th, with 34% of sales coming from the Switch release.</p>
<p>But that's quite enough waffling, here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>The Pokémon Company is once again risking a poké-palava at a museum, with the announcement of a pop-up store at London's Natural History Museum selling exclusive items.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-van-gogh-exhibit-includes-exclusive-pikachu-trading-card">Pokémon collaboration was launched with Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a> featuring six Pokémon paintings and a store selling an exclusive Pikachu trading card. Yet scalpers descended on the museum, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">four employees being suspended</a> - one allegedly embezzled a box of cards.</p>
<p>Now The Pokémon Company is moving to London for its first pop-up in a UK museum, and it's all about evolution - and Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>"There is such a wonderful alignment between Pokémon and the Natural History Museum - we're obviously both big fans of the natural world and its evolution and diversity," said Adam Farrar, director of commercial and visitor experience for the museum. "We hope this collaboration will spark joy and curiosity in the creatures around us, both in the world of Pokémon and Earth."</p>
<p>The store will sell clothing, stationary, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plushie toy - it's a Pikachu hugging the museum, as below.</p>

<p>"Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum's iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum's archives," said Mathieu Galante, senior director of licensing for Pokémon Europe. "We are excited to be working with the Natural History Museum to create this fun pop-up store for fans of all ages."</p>
<p>Note, however, the pop-up is not a Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>What's more, in an attempt to prevent scalping, free tickets will be required to attend the store. These will be available online from 1st October, but you can <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html?utm_source=pokemon-press-announcement-20250922-hp&amp;utm_medium=nhm-press&amp;utm_campaign=retail">sign up to be the first to hear</a>.</p>
<p>The pop-up will run from 26th January to 22nd March next year, with the product range also available to buy <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7">online from the Natural History Museum shop</a> from January - all purchases will support the museum's charitable mission of supporting scientific research into the planetary emergency.</p>
<p>Some products will additionally be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/">Pokémon Centre UK official online store</a>.</p>
<p>Let's hope it doesn't cause another chaotic fiasco over exclusive items, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-apologises-for-the-disappointment-caused-by-scalpers-buying-up-all-of-its-van-gogh-items">The Pokémon Company has to apologise</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-review.1304085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few who would dispute that last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> was a supremely well-executed remake of the 2001 original, but you could also argue in retrospect that developer Bloober Team’s modernising of a survival horror masterpiece was a pretty safe bet. Silent Hill f, from developer Neobards Entertainment, is a much bolder undertaking by comparison. It offers an entirely new story in a completely foreign setting, with a captivating protagonist who bucks the series’ trend of featuring predominately morose, middle-aged men, and keeps its handguns holstered in favour of a strictly melee-focussed fighting system. Although the cumbersome and inconsistent nature of its pipe-swinging combat made it something I had to grin and bear rather than rip and tear, Silent Hill f is a success in almost every other way and is certainly one of the strongest new games in the series since the PlayStation 2 era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case it wasn’t clear, Silent Hill f is a Silent Hill story that doesn’t in any way feature the well-trodden town of its namesake. In fact, it’s the first mainline entry in the iconic Japanese survival horror series that’s actually set in Japan – in this case the fictional village of Ebisugaoka in the 1960s – and it provides a backdrop rich with carefully crafted cultural touches that make it one of the series’ most intriguing locations to explore. Every little detail combines to evoke a strong sense of place, from the muddy rice fields to slosh through to the ramune soda bottles to gulp down and the puzzles inspired by local folklore to solve, some of which proved to be seriously challenging for my ignorant Australian brain. (I’ve tracked down plenty of keys and crests in the survival horror genre over the years, but I’ve never needed to put my controller down and Google what a kudzu plant looks like before.)   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also the first time in a long time that a mainline Silent Hill story has allowed us to take control of a lead character with any sort of meaningful depth, in this case high school student Hinako Shimizu. The black sheep of her family, Hinako is clearly the victim of an abusive, alcoholic father and her subservient enabler of a mother. In typical Silent Hill fashion, her many psychological scars manifest themselves into menacing physical threats as her sleepy village adopts an increasingly creepy visage, forcing Hinako to become a doggedly determined agent of her own destiny rather than a mere damsel in distress. From there, Silent Hill f’s story confidently explores the complex themes of gender discrimination, child abuse, and drug dependency – among many other horrific human afflictions – gradually teasing out the root causes of Hinako’s torment through the uncovering of private letters from her school friends and increasingly frequent encounters with malevolent visual metaphors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes Heavy Rain’s infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What unfolds is an utterly absorbing adventure, tautly paced and packed with surprises including some moments of genuinely unsettling body horror and torture – seriously, there’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain’s</a> infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut. It all builds to a thoroughly harrowing conclusion at the end of Hinako’s nine-hour journey that left me with plenty of disturbing thoughts to process, as well as a strong urge to head back into New Game+ to explore Hinako’s other potential fates further via the four additional endings to unlock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Soup Foggy Slog</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fog descends on Ebisugaoka and blood-red flowers and veiny tendrils start to entangle its mysteriously abandoned streets, so begins the emergence of various nightmarish creatures that hound Hinako at every turn. Some of the neighbourhood nasties seem pretty <em>fog </em>standard for a Silent Hill campaign, like the mannequin-esque dolls that go for your throat with kitchen knives from around unchecked corners. However, there are a decent number of inspired new creature creations too, such as the twisted scarecrows modelled on Hinako’s schoolmates that shift from contorted stationary poses to startling lunges whenever you turn your back to them, like they’re playing a more stab-happy game of schoolyard statues. Later there are some truly disgusting, slack-mawed beasts covered in bulbous bellies like an enormous cluster of rotting flesh grapes, that give birth to howling demon types in an attempt to overwhelm you. There’s no doubt that Silent Hill f took one look at the series’ dedication to conjuring up the most repulsive monstrosities possible, and asked someone to hold its can of Asahi. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish I had as much fun fighting these magnificent monsters as I did marveling at their exceptionally ghastly forms, because actually taking them on usually isn’t fun and it isn’t particularly frightening. It’s just annoying – and this doesn’t seem like the type of survival horror where you’re supposed to feel outmatched and avoid combat whenever possible, at least not beyond its opening hours. Unlike many previous Silent Hill stories, there isn’t a single shotgun or pistol to be found in Silent Hill f to battle these beasts with. Instead Hinako is only capable of carrying up to three breakable melee weapons like crowbars and baseball bats that she finds in her surroundings – which makes sense in context, since you’d assume that firearms would be harder to stumble upon in a mountainside village in Japan than they would be in the series’ usual home in the United States. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the strictly close-quarters combat encounters largely involve delivering a mix of light and heavy attacks as well as performing dashes and dodges to evade incoming blows, all of which sap Hinako’s aggravatingly stingy stamina bar and momentarily curb her ability to perform any of these actions should you allow it to deplete. There is also a focus ability that allows you to pull off special charged-up hits and easier counters, and even blocks if you're holding a heavy weapon like the sledgehammer, but this too comes at a cost – draining your sanity meter which, once emptied, makes Hinako’s health bar vulnerable to both physical and shrieking psychological attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having to constantly keep tabs on your health, stamina, sanity, and the state of your weapons, all felt like a bit too much to balance for my tastes – certainly off the back of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2’s</a> fear and instinct-driven point-and-shoot simplicity – and I never really settled into an enjoyable groove with Silent Hill f’s comparatively stilted and repetitive combat as a result. These attributes can admittedly be enhanced slightly over time with buffs and consumables you collect, and nailing a perfect dodge does reward you with a handy stamina boost, but more often than I’d have liked Hinako would run out of puff faster than an asthmatic in a smoker’s lounge and I’d be forced to sort of awkwardly shuffle backwards away from a snarling enemy while I waited for her to remember how her arms worked. Even when there was still plenty of stamina up her school uniform’s sleeve, there were countless times where Hinako would just stubbornly pause between strikes for extended periods while I furiously pumped the attack button in vain.     </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Coping with the restrictive nature of the stamina bar wasn’t my main problem with Silent Hill f’s melee combat, though. Nor was it that my slow and energy-sapping swings would often clang harmlessly into nearby walls despite the fact enemies were often somehow able to hit me directly through scenery. It also wasn’t the way the lock-on target switching seemed frustratingly unreliable when the campaign’s second half puts you up against enemy groups in greater numbers, or how monsters would occasionally hack chunks off my health bar when I was defenselessly trapped in animations like entering a doorway. No, my biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, where you earn XP from killing enemies in order to level up your character, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> where freshly dispatched foes will often drop vital ammo boxes or healing herbs, winning a battle in Silent Hill f means <em>likely </em>losing some of your health bar and <em>definitely </em>doing some damage to your annoyingly brittle weapons. (Hinako is unable to fight with her bare hands.) This was also true of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> remake – if you substitute a loss of ammo in place of wear and tear on your breakable bats and sickles, that is – but the major difference is that I found the breathless and intuitive thrills of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>’s shotgun-toting scraps to be its own reward. Since I didn’t find Silent Hill f’s fighting to be anywhere near as urgent or exciting, I opted to just straight-up avoid enemy encounters wherever I could – especially the more heavy-set foes that can absorb half a lead pipe’s worth of overhead swings before they expired. (Seriously, if I have to use a big stick to violently smack something eight or nine times before it caves in, I’d at least expect it to suddenly spill packets of Skittles all over the floor at a birthday party.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprisingly, this wasn’t too hard to do for the most part given that most enemies can be comfortably juked around with the dodge button, and many of these easily distracted demons give up the chase the instant you slip around a corner and break the line of sight, as though they’re hellborn babies who’re yet to fully comprehend object permanence. I quickly started skipping combat wherever possible by just running past each ghoul on the way to my next story objective, or ducking into a side street to search for supplies before hoofing it right back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This passive strategy of exploiting the enemies’ weak AI only worked for so long, and indeed in the story’s final hours there are an increasing amount of repetitive gauntlet-run slogs where the path forward is fully blocked until you kill every creature in the vicinity, but there were lengthy stretches in the first half where I was hustling along a sped-up run-through of Ebisugaoka that seemed more Benny Hill than Silent Hill. That made it tough for the town’s increasingly bleak atmosphere to completely work its way under my skin, no matter how insistent its genuinely ominous ambient audio became, but at least I was having fun rather than feeling frustrated.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Phantasmic Mr. Fox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Torii gate and lantern-lined shrine realm that Hinako drifts in and out of over the course of her journey does mitigate some of these combat issues, but it also gradually empowers her to a point where fighting becomes arguably too easy at times. Visits to this ethereal otherworld, which provides a sinister yet strangely beautiful contrast to the village’s increasingly festering streets, sees Hinako slowly slip under the spell of a morally ambiguous mystery man wearing a fox mask, who’s given the decidedly Kojima-esque name of ‘Fox Mask’. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, Hinako is given an indestructible dagger and polearm in these sections, allowing her to tackle the same monster mobs from the real world minus the risk of each weapon splintering to bits in her hands mid-scrap. However, by the story’s midpoint she’s gained the supernatural ability to siphon the soul power from each enemy she kills and channel it into a sort of beast mode that makes her overpowered and invulnerable for short bursts at a time. To be fair, Hinako’s otherworld evolution does make sense thematically, but her newfound, fox-powered fighting ability is kind of at odds with the fundamentals of survival horror, since unleashing it made me feel less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[I felt] less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine realm also brought some frustrations with Silent Hill f’s inventory system to the surface. Having limited pocket space in a survival horror adventure is a given, but I wish that there had been an item storage box of some sort at each Shinto shrine save point so that I could carry consumables that made more sense in the ornate otherworld than they did in the village. For example, I tended to stockpile the toolkits required to repair weapons out in Hinako’s hometown, but since they were useless in the shrine realm I was forced to either offload them completely or sacrifice some precious inventory slots to hold onto them until Hinako returned to the real world. I mean, her collection of earthbound weapons are there waiting for her upon her reemergence from the shrine realm, why not the toolkits too?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Having said that, Silent Hill f’s otherworld does at least play host to the bulk of its boss fights, which offer bursts of flashy spectacle on par with other melee-focussed adventures like Elden Ring or Lies of P, but thankfully without being nearly as punishing to overcome – at least, not on the standard combat difficulty setting. Again, there are some really striking character designs on display here, such as the aggressive apparition that shrouds the arena with a red mist to mask its sneaky teleportations, attacks from long distance with a spiked flail, and wraps Hinako in a bear hug to gnaw on her face if you get too close. While these battles still rely on the same sluggish slashing and dodging as every other enemy encounter, they at least provide a bit more in the way of strategic depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, the bulk of the shrine realm’s levels are structured as elaborate puzzle boxes that are consistently satisfying to solve, from disorientating switch-based mazes to confoundingly cryptic treasure hunts. In fact, in general the puzzles in Silent Hill f do an excellent job of momentarily sidelining combat for a more cerebral challenge, and also serving as crucial storytelling devices. Playing on the hard puzzle difficulty setting, I was regularly forced to pore over every scrap of information in Hinako’s journal for clues, and there are some really clever puzzle sequences to explore here, such as collecting scattered calendar pages in Hinako’s family home and then using them to jump through different time periods to hunt down the disturbing ghosts from her past. If the next Silent Hill focuses more on this sort of thing than on aggravating combat, it will really be onto something. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review]]></content:encoded>
