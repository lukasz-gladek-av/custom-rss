			<p>The yet-to-be-announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is reportedly scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">this month</a>, but it shouldn't be expected to become available this week, judging from what a reliable insider said in the past few days.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known insider NateTheHate reiterated that the game will be released in the second half of the month, so its launch shouldn't be expected this week. While the precise release date hasn't been confirmed, the insider suggested with another comment that the remake could be released close to April 21st, as an X user who celebrates their birthday on that day could consider the game a birthday gift.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I've already said it's in the second half of the month.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1908673744299585910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be close enough that you could consider it a birthday gift.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1908664050545840312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, it has quickly become one of the worst-kept video game secrets of the past few years. Funnily enough, the game wasn't revealed by insiders but by Bethesda's owner, Microsoft, in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> held with Xbox's head, Phil Spencer. Unfortunately, every other piece of information known about the game, such as its developer, which should be known porting and support studio Virtuos, its engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay changes</a> it should feature, has yet to be confirmed, but if the remake is indeed releasing in the second half of the month, the wait won't be much longer not just to see it in action, but to experience it ourselves.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada-following-us-delay-last-week.1158387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada have been delayed, following on from the company's decision last week to push back the pre-order window for the console in the US.</p>

<p>On Friday last week, Nintendo announced that US Switch 2 pre-orders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">would be delayed</a> in order to give the Japanese gaming giant time to assess "evolving market conditions" brought about by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

<p>Now, in a statement given to Canadian tech news platform <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US' neighboring Canada will also be delayed. Pre-orders in Canada were originally due to open on April 9th, but a new date hasn't been announced.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-canada-pre-orders-delayed-mario-kart.jpg?itok=GmKTi3xs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-canada-pre-orders-delayed-mario-kart.jpg?itok=DsCuBNQn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Switch 2 won't be available for pre-order in Canada tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>In the statement given to MobileSyrup, Nintendo said the Canadian delay was being put into effect "to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US" and that more information would be provided "at a later date".</p>

<p>Just like in the US, however, Nintendo hasn't given any suggestion that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> will be delayed in Canada. It is, however, possible that the console's price will be changed, although no price change has been announced in either country.</p>

<p>This also shouldn't affect pre-orders in any other countries, although as usual, it's worth keeping an eye out for any specific announcements pertaining to your country of residence to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 last week. Launching on June 5th, the console will cost $450 in the US and around $630 in Canada (at least, as far as we know).</p>




<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a> will include the likes of racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as tech demo-style title&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, which, despite its title, won't be a free pack-in game.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the Switch 2 will still be launching on June 5th in Canada. Nintendo will likely announce when pre-orders will open in both the US and Canada in the coming days or weeks, so stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada were set to begin at 12:01am ET on April 9 in some stores. Unfortunately, players across the country will have to wait as Nintendo has delayed pre-orders for the console in the country at the last minute.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo confirmed the decision to wait until a later date.</p>



<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada will not start on April 9, 2025 in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S. Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>



<p>The statement reads similar to the one provided when the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed pre-orders in the United States</a> last week.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch is currently priced at $629 CAD for the base system and $699 CAD for the Mario Kart World Bundle. It’s currently unknown if there could be any change to pricing of the system in the country or if it will just be, as the company said, to align with United States plans.</p>



<p>What do you think of Nintendo also delaying pre-orders of the Switch 2 in Canada? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a> is inspired by the Belle Epoque, a period in French history from 1871 to 1914. Since there was no war, the era is remembered for being peaceful, and technology flourished. For example, The Eiffel Tower and the Paris Subway system were created, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut project puts a dystopian spin on that quiet time.</p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress. When she paints a number on a monolith, everyone of that age turns to smoke and fades away. That number decreases every year, and one group sets out to stop her before she paints their age. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qgOZDRDynw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal trailer</a> set the tone for what to expect from this unique take on a turn-based RPG. The Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe are bent and distorted, and the expedition group needs to worry about more than just the paintress. </p>



<p>Strange marionettes and other large beasts have overrun France, and players have an arsenal of turn-based attacks but can also dodge, parry, and counter in real-time by timing the rhythms of attacks to take down every enemy. </p>

Now we know it's for the console's new GameChat feature. We recently had a chance to ask Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta a question about the button, and we've also learned what happens when you press it and don't have a Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p><p>Since the C button is used to connect to an online service, we asked Dohta what happens if you press the button and your console is not connected to the internet. He didn't tell us exactly what happens, but he confirmed it won't do anything... bad.</p><p>"Sorry, I can't get into the details of what exactly pops up or shows up when you press the button [when you're not online], but just rest assured nothing bad's going to happen," he said.</p><p>It's nice to know pressing the C button when you're offline won't do anything bad, but what will actually happen if you press it when you're offline?

            <p>Nintendo is delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders in Canada.</p>
<p>Pre-orders were set to go live in Canada tomorrow, 9th April. However, "in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US", this date has now been shifted to an unspecified time.</p>

<p>"Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date," the company told <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a>, adding the scheduled Switch 2 launch date of 5th June remains "unchanged".</p>
<p>News of pre-orders getting delayed in Canada follows Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States</a>, with the company citing the impact of Trump's tariffs as well as "evolving market conditions" as the reason. At this time, Canada was still planning to kick off Switch 2 pre-orders on 9th April.</p>
<p>As with Canada, the Switch 2 is still expected to release on 5th June in the US.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs last week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine the opening credits playing on a pilot episode of a television show—the scene-setting, the character introductions teasing backstories and defining traits, the tantalizing hints of the larger story ahead. That’s what one-shots do for manga: These special chapters, typically longer than the standard 20-page weekly installments, offer readers their first glimpse into a series’ expansive universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Some one-shots, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a><em> </em>by Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, exist as standalone masterpieces, perfectly self-contained. Others, like those for <a href="https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen the big three</a>—<em>One Piece, Naruto and Bleach</em>— act as the <a href="https://www.viz.com/wanted-eiichiro-oda-before-one-piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeds from which global phenomena grew</a>. One-shots are mangaka’s hail mary—a chance to go from a complete unknown to a household name in the manga world. While the journey from one-shot to full-fledged manga series isn’t foolproof, Rafał Jaki from <em>No\Name</em> told me the story behind the grand opening and grand closing of Shueisha’s first Western-published manga series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="No/Name Manga Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HAt2-yDEc8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>No\Name in a nutshell</h2><p>When manga fans discovered that <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-anime-trigger-2077-1849530790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em></a> showrunner Rafał Jaki had taken a creative leap post-anime and won <a href="https://medibang.com/mpc/mom/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shueisha’s Shonen Jump+ Creators competition</a>, excitement reached a fever pitch. His imaginative new series, No\Name, made history as the first Western manga to be published bi-weekly alongside fan-favorite titles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dandadan</em></a>.</p><p><a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No\Name</a>, a dark mystery thriller by Jaki and artist MACHINE GAMU, is set in Northern Europe. The series poses an intriguing question: What if your name endowed you with supernatural powers tied to its meaning? Central to this world is the Nordic Naming Bureau (NNB), a government organization that issues names to newborns, effectively regulating both their powers and their societal standing.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>The story follows two NNA agents—Ralf, whose name translates to “wolf commander,” and Ursula, meaning “bear”—as they investigate the disappearance of a prominent public figure’s child. What unfolds is a tense and action-packed mystery, exploring the many layers of the series’ unique premise. Within a week of its one-shot chapter release in September 2023, <em>No\Name</em> captivated over one million readers, and their <a href="https://twitter.com/GwentBro/status/1818577567709827289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enthusiastic response</a> paved the way for the series to be officially picked up for publication in July of the following year. However, after an intense 14-chapter run, the series came to an abrupt end, leaving manga readers to play armchair expert—as they’re often left to do—wondering if <em>No\Name</em> was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RBvZ6R26g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest in a promising new shonen series cancelled</a> before things got going.&nbsp;</p><p>To clear up the confusion, I spoke with Jaki to discuss his experience publishing on Shonen Jump+ and to debunk misconceptions about what the workflow was like for a creator working with one of the world’s most renowned publishers.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>Contrary to popular belief, <em>No\Name</em> wasn’t axed</h2><p>Jaki clarified that <em>No\Name</em> was neither axed nor cancelled prematurely, despite online speculation. While Jaki acknowledged that the series' ending mirrored what typically happens when a manga is cancelled, he emphasized that the conclusion was in line with the editorial agreement Shueisha had outlined for him before the series even began its publication.</p><p>“First, they wanted to see more finished chapters to review them and see our ability to continue and execute, but also, they asked for the first arc of the story,” Jaki said. “I’m a ‘discovery’ writer, which means that I tend to do my best work while I’m writing the actual script vs having a detailed outline (so the plan of events and stakes and characters involved) as a starting point. But they needed to see an outline, which requires a pretty detailed plan (meaning scene by scene, chapter by chapter). To do that, we needed to settle on a page count that resulted in a number of volumes that Jump+ is committing to publishing physically in Japan.”&nbsp;</p><p>At first, Jaki envisioned <em>No\Name</em> as a concise series spanning four to five volumes with 30-page chapters, which he believed would “do the trick” to cover its full run. However, Shueisha had a different perspective. Considering that Jaki and GAMU were a “rookie team,” the publisher felt that Jaki’s original plan would be “too much as a binding commitment.” As a result, the strategy was adjusted — <em>No\Name</em>’s first two arcs would unfold over two volumes, culminating in “a proper, satisfying ending.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We of course asked if we could continue past two volumes, and they said that it is a possibility only if it becomes a hit. So we went to work hoping it will become one and gave our best. The reality was that it was popular in the West (but not a top hit) and doing barely ok in Japan, so they kept their word, and we ended it according to the outline we provided before we even started the serialization,” Jaki said.&nbsp;</p><p>“The really cool and surprising twist at the end was that the editorial team (on their own) put this message at the last page of the final chapter, so it gave us confidence to get to work on a new thing,” Jaki added, referencing <em>No\Name</em>’s afterword thanking readers for following the series and asking them to look forward to the creators’ next work.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>“Buffer” chapters in manga production</h2><p>While corresponding for my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rafa-jaki-went-from-cyberpunk-edgerunners-to-shonen-jumps-first-western-manga-artist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior feature interview with Jaki</a>, he’d mentioned he had chapters prepared weeks before their release. The practice was news to me. Years of writing articles about how mangaka like <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-yoshihiro-togashi-manga-hiatus-gon-kill-1848969729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter x Hunter</em>’s Yoshihiro Togashi</a> put his series on hiatus after falling ill trying to meet <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grueling production demands</a> and Fujimoto wishing he could <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-manga-oshi-no-ko-crunchyroll-shonen-jump-1850684535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stop drawing <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and write its story</a> to meet weekly releases made Jaki’s casual revelation sound like a no-brainer solution to cushion creative burnout plaguing the industry. Although Jaki couldn’t speak on the production schedule for other mangaka, he said that other mangaka tend to have “quite a few ‘buffer’ chapters” ready to go before they start serialization on a weekly or bi-weekly series.&nbsp;</p><p>“In print, Weekly Shonen Jump the chapters are around 20 pages usually, and that goes out every week. On the <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump+ and Manga+ app </a>&nbsp;you have also bi-weekly serialization (<em>No\Name</em> being one of them). To hit that WSJ weekly release, a mangaka will have assistants working on backgrounds, VFX, SFX etc. For example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto assistants</a> were in the past: Tatsuya Endo (<em>Spy X Family</em>), Oto Tōda (<em>Chihayafuru</em>), Yuji Kaku (<em>Hell’s Paradise</em>), Yukinobu Tatsu (<em>Dandadan</em>), and Tohru Kuramori (<em>Centuria</em>),” Jaki said. “So, a company of highly skilled people under one mangaka works as a team to hit that deadline. Of course, this does not mean that all mangaka that are serialized in WSJ get to have this amount of stuff to do it - but once you get the initial sales numbers, it makes sense to have that setup. However, multiple chapters are prepared in advance before a series starts.”</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>He continued: “It’s more common to prepare more chapters independently without any assistants for bi-weekly. We had volume 1 done for <em>No\Name</em> before we started, but we did not have any assistant working with GAMU on the art, so it would take him 3-4 weeks to complete a chapter, and that meant we had just enough time to make our deadlines for volume 2. But as life happens–someone will get sick and you lose a week or so, we had a computer die on GAMU and we lost some work and a few days to buy and set up a new one, etc.–and that buffer gets eaten up. GAMU did work each day all day to hit the deadlines we had, but if we would continue past volume two, we would have to hire an assistant to be able to deliver the chapter bi-weekly, and you need to be a hit for it to make financial sense.”</p><p>Combine that with the challenges already faced by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/being-a-manga-letterer-is-more-than-having-a-fun-job-2000549285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Western manga letterers</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translators</a>, who often juggle multiple series just to make ends meet, <em>No\Name</em>’s continuation would’ve added another layer of complexity in its production, requiring localizers and typographers to rework the series for Japanese audiences based on Jaki and GAMU’s original efforts—all while racing to meet the demanding schedule of a bi-weekly publication. While some manga series have managed to secure continuation thanks to the<a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> collective efforts of overseas fans boosting Japanese volume sales</a>, despite Jaki’s best social media efforts, <em>No\Name</em> didn’t follow the same trajectory.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>Manga volume sales (in Japan) make or break a series</h2><p>As Jaki noted in a post on his <a href="https://x.com/GwentBro/status/1844074463878369385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Twitter account</a>, <em>No\Name</em> was performing strongly when it launched on Jump+ in Japan and Manga+ in the West with around 900,000 readers in Japan and 250,000 in the West. However, the series faced a sharp decline in readers, losing more readers than other new shonen series like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-new-manga-to-read-2025-2000560252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MAD</em></a> in Japan from chapter two onward, making a continuation unlikely unless volume one of the series sold well in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>“After we started serialization, we got numbers from the Japanese app and web views, which were on the edge. They could go either way, so the next threshold was the physical volume one sales in Japan that could change the already-established plan to finish with two volumes,” Jaki said.</p><p>Being able to see how things were going under the hood with weekly reader metrics and volume sales, Jaki and GAMU had <a href="https://twitter.com/GwentBro/status/1844074463878369385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an inclination that the series wouldn’t outlive their initial agreement</a>.</p><p>“We lived in a different head space vs our editor — he was thinking that if volume one physical Japanese sales [were] robust, we can talk about doing more than two volumes, where we were hoping that it would happen and wanted to do everything we could to help that,” Jaki said. “So our editor told us after the initial sales number of volume one came in that, as planned, the series will end with volume two.”</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>From a reader's perspective, <em>No\Name</em> had been steadily building momentum, expanding its overarching mystery far beyond the groundwork laid in its earlier chapters. So when it was announced that the manga’s 14th chapter would serve as its finale, fans were left reeling. Ralf and Ursula were on the brink of uncovering the mastermind behind a newly introduced government conspiracy that involved abducting unnamed children from foreign countries and only had 20 pages to wrap everything up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>In February 2025, the series’ final chapter took a sharp turn, culminating in a meta ending where the protagonists parted ways with the hope of reuniting in the future. This left readers wondering whether Jaki and GAMU had to adjust the trajectory of <em>No\Name </em>to tie up loose plot threads in its final chapter. Jaki confirmed that they did have to make changes and leave certain story developments on the cutting room floor during the collaboration process. However, despite these adjustments, the series concluded on the note they had initially envisioned when pitching the story prior to serialization.</p><p>“As a ‘discovery writer’ working under a strict outline (that I had to write before writing the scripts), we knew where we were heading. However, I still changed a bunch of stuff, removing possible hints and threads I knew I could not finish at this point,” Jaki said. “Still, overall, we did not change anything significant from the outline I submitted before we started serialization.”</p></div><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>No hard feelings&nbsp;</h2><p>Manga publishers like Shueisha are known for frequently greenlighting new series, but just as often, they pull the plug on others. Endings can sometimes feel abrupt, offering little insight into the directions the story might have taken. In some cases, such as Yuki Kawaguchi’s <em>The Hunter’s Guild: Red Hood</em>’s sudden end, conclusions delve into meta-textual territory, engaging readers in a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/shonen-jump-red-hood-hunters-guild-axed-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialogue about the reality of manga cancellations</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on <em>No\Name</em>, Jaki remains content with how the series wrapped up. While he acknowledges there were additional avenues he would have loved to explore in terms of its world-building and characters, he’s satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>“My biggest takeaway is that even though I’ve been a manga fan for as long as I can remember, clarity of the story and art is key, and characters need to spell out their purpose in the story early and frequently,” Jaki said. “Japanese readers especially put a lot of emphasis on this vs the West, where ‘innovation’ or finding a new and fresh thing is priced at a premium.”</p><p>From his early days as a devoted manga fan, Jaki’s journey with <em>No\Name</em> spans 24 years, rooted in the formative experiences of a 13-year-old Polish kid captivated by Akira Toriyama’s <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That passion ultimately propelled him to the milestone of becoming Shonen Jump+’s first Western manga creator. As our conversation drew to a close, the lingering question I had for Jaki was whether working on his series — and getting a firsthand look at the industry’s inner workings — had ever left him feeling disillusioned.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha<span></span><span>© Shueisha </span></figcaption></figure><p>“My background is the business and publishing side of the video game industry, so I was not surprised at all. In general, American comics, board games, manga, film, and TV work similarly – everyone wants to make the next big thing, and the system is tailored towards that. Because I know a lot about how things are monetized, I understood that the likelihood of us becoming the next big thing on the first try is unlikely at best,” Jaki said. “ As a creator I must believe that what we are doing is worthy of people’s time and attention – so I would struggle not to get my hopes up, but at the same time have faith in what we are doing as it would be very easy to be overwhelmed by how big of a challenge this all is.”</p><p>He continued, “At the end of the day, we did a thing, some people liked it a lot (but not the needed amount to make more), and we learned and can go and try to make a new thing with all the lessons we have in our pocket.”</p><p>As far as <a href="https://x.com/GwentBro/status/1781211288175010180?t=91XDQ9Y1u86MVQyKO5nOgA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what the future holds</a>, Jaki can’t say much about what he and GAMU are cooking, but they are currently working on two concepts together. One, he hopes, “can go further :).”</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

		<p>There’s always at least one odd-ball game that Nintendo releases around the start of a new console generation, looking to take advantage of new controllers and inputs. For the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s Drag x Drive, and while it’s not filled with the same kind of ostentatious characters and flamboyant style, its all-new control scheme could make it the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now obviously they’re two very different games – ARMS was a third-person fighting game, while Drag x Drive is a gritty-looking take on wheelchair basketball – but they are both games that take the fact that you can very easily have two Joy-Con in hand, and then use motion controls and other sensors for inputs. They’re also a real physical workout for your upper body!</p>


<p>Drag x Drive is all about mouse mode, using the Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors in tandem with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the inputs disguises just how difficult this can be to get your head around manoeuvring a wheelchair. Placing the two Joy-Con edge-side down on the table to engage mouse mode – your trouser legs can probably do almost as well – you can propel yourself directly ahead by pushing both controllers forward. Push fast enough and you’ll hit maximum speed with little lights gleaming at the back of your chair. When you need to come to a halt, you engage the brakes with both triggers.</p>


<p>Straight lines are easy, but turning needs a bit of thought, as you push the left wheel forward (and the right wheel backwards) to turn to the right. Getting used to this is a bit like trying to figure out if you need to invert or un-invert your axis, or paddling a boat down stream by paddling on either side. Except, of course, here there’s a lot more pressure to spin yourself around, race up and down the court, and play B-ball!</p>
<p>Once you’ve run through the tutorial, Drag x Drive is all about 3v3 matches, passing the oversized ball back and forth between you and dodging past your opponents to get a shot at the hoop. This is as simple as lifting a hand and flicking the ball to try and score, or as complicated as racing up the quarter-pipe ramp at the end of the court to let you pull an audacious spinning slam dunk – something I couldn’t get the hang of in my limited time with the game. Pull off a cool dunk and you’ll get a couple bonus decimal points to your score, which can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>

<p>In defence, positioning and tracking back will be key –&nbsp;thankfully there’s always an on-screen indicator for where the ball is, while the camera remains fixed behind you – and the key defensive move is to ram into the ball-carrier and knock the ball free.</p>
<p>There’s all the regular rules of basketball at play here, so there’s 2 points awarded for a shot inside the half circle, and 3 points from outside, and there’s a shot clock as well, so you can’t keep hold of the ball for too long. Once it times out, the ball will just ping from your lap and give the other team a chance to grab it.</p>
<p>The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see.</p>

<p>Secondly, it’s all just a bit… drab. There’s some neon lights around the hoop’s backboard, and the scoreboard is built into the ramps on the end of the court in an attractive way, but everything’s just very, very grey. The court is grey, your wheelchair is grey, your character is wearing grey clothes and a grey helmet. Hopefully this is just down to the demo, because this game deserves and needs to have so much more character. There should be an arena set right in the middle of Rio de Janiero, a futuristic London or on Mars, your avatars should have an over-the-top hairdo and brightly coloured sports vests, and you should be able to race around to celebrate much more than just waving your arms around in real life.</p>
<p>Again, I hope we’re just seeing a tiny snippet of what this game can offer. With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could – <em>could –</em>&nbsp;be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.</p>
<p>Also, can we maybe get ARMS 2, Nintendo?</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">The Outlast Trials</a> Season 2.2 update is arriving today, and it's the last major update ahead of the Season 3 launch later this month on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Update 2.2 of the Project Breach season will have players trying to defy Murkoff and escape his torture house of experiments that turn your guts inside out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-breach-update-for-the-outlast-trials-now-live-introducing-amelia-collier/">Amelia Collier</a> has hacked into his system, providing a small window of opportunity for the Reagents to get out of dodge while they can.</p>
<p><strong>The Escape</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Under Surveillance Part II</strong> are the two new trials added with this update. In the former, you'll work together with up to four Reagents to get to the Sleep Room, interact with the terminal and get the escape plan in order. The latter will task you with finding the escape plans scattered all across the trials, and finding Amelia's escape message before Murkoff does. You can't escape the Murkoff Institution otherwise, so you'll want to make the most out of your one chance to escape.</p>
<p>The update also adds the Amelia catalog of cosmetics, allowing you to don her look to show your support in the liberation effort. You can unlock the cosmetics by grabbing event tokens from certain tasks in the Under Surveillance trials. And of course, make sure to use them as the event tokens will be gone once the event is over, and the new Season 3 update arrives on April 22.</p>
<p>Speaking of things to do in The Outlast Trials before April 22, this update is also your last chance to experience Rebirth, before the mode is suspended with the Season 3 update, as Red Barrels takes some time to re-tool it. So, if you want to grab some of the legendary outfits that come with being reborn, you have about two weeks to do so at the time of writing.</p>
<p>There's currently no word on when it'll be back, so make sure to take advantage while you can. And while you wait for the update to download on your console or PC, you can check out the new The Outlast Trials trailer for update 2.2 below.</p>

Yet our curiosity remains, like a phantom itch we can only scratch with mind-bending television. Luckily for us, <em>Severance </em>is just the latest in a long line of cerebral dramas that’ll have you questioning what’s real about your life. </p><p>  <em>Dark Matter</em> unravels the chaos of identity across parallel lives, while <em>Mr. Robot</em> drags you down a hacker rabbit hole full of fractured minds and unreliable realities. <em>Maniac</em> is a pharmaceutical fever dream, pairing high-concept sci-fi with emotional disarray. <em>Homecoming</em> whispers paranoia through pristine therapy sessions, and <em>Westworld</em> turns loops of consciousness into a violent symphony of rebellion. If you’re ready to tumble down more reality-warping rabbit holes, here are 10 shows that twist the mind, bend the rules, and will satiate your appetite for <em>Severance-</em>style mysteries until the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552">returns for its third season</a></span>.</p></div></div><div><p>Apple TV’s <em>Dark Matter</em> may come wrapped in glossier tech and fewer cubicles than <em>Severance</em>, but don’t be fooled—both series revel in the quiet horror of split identities and corporate puppeteering. Based on Blake Crouch’s novel, the show follows Jason Dessen (Joel Edgerton), a mild-mannered physicist who’s abducted into a parallel universe by a more ambitious version of himself, forcing him into a cat-and-mouse game across alternate realities. Where <em>Severance</em> slices the self neatly in two with surgical precision, <em>Dark Matter</em> takes a sledgehammer to the soul, splintering reality with every jump.</p><p>Jason doesn’t just wrestle with duality—he’s hunted by the man he could’ve been. Like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S. (Adam Scott), he’s trapped between grief and a synthetic peace, except this time the office is swapped for a multiverse-hopping nightmare. Both shows deliver corporate paranoia with a side of existential dread, and both ask the same brutal question: What part of you is really you when someone else—or something else—is calling the shots?</p></div><div><p>If you think Lumon’s sterile stairwells are creepy, wait until you’ve seen two versions of J.K. Simmons stalking each other across a Berlin split not by a wall, but by dimensions. <em>Counterpart</em> is a brainy, noir-soaked spy thriller with just enough high-concept sci-fi to scratch the same itch as <em>Severance</em>. The premise? A mild-mannered UN pencil-pusher named Howard Silk (Simmons) discovers that his organization has been guarding a portal to a parallel Earth for decades—and his counterpart, a colder, deadlier version of himself, has crossed over to stop a cross-dimensional cold war from going hot. </p><p>Much like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Counterpart</em> weaponizes identity—posing unnerving questions about who we are when stripped of memory, emotion, or the comfort of a single self. And like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S., Howard is both victim and investigator, forced to untangle not just a mystery, but his own fractured reflection. Throw in double-crosses, bureaucratic overlords, and a few ethically murky lab experiments, and you’ve got a show that doesn’t just echo <em>Severance</em>, it deepens the conversation.</p></div><div><p><em>Maniac</em> is the acid trip therapy session that breaks the whole brain in half before stitching it back together with neon thread. The Netflix limited series tracks Owen (Jonah Hill), a paranoid schizophrenic heir with a tenuous grip on reality, and Annie (Emma Stone), a pill-addicted loner haunted by the death of her sister, as they’re pulled into a clinical trial promising to “fix” them. What unfolds is a kaleidoscopic plunge into shared delusions—one minute they’re noir detectives interrogating lemurs, the next they’re elf-eared fantasy warriors—all orchestrated by a malfunctioning AI therapist named GRTA (who, like Lumon’s severed employees, has her own breakdown mid-procedure). </p><p>Like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Maniac</em> explores the allure and danger of erasing pain to become more “productive.” When Owen’s mind fractures between his real self and his fantasy personas, it mirrors Innie Mark’s slow discovery that his other life might be a lie. And just like that chilling Lumon break room scene, <em>Maniac</em> features a moment in which the characters are forced to relive their worst memories for the sake of “treatment.” Both shows sit at the crossroads of sci-fi and psychology, where identity is a glitchy loop and the cure might just be worse than the disease.</p></div><div><p>The sterile cubicles and coded memories of <em>Severance</em> find a chilling parallel in the clinical corridors of <em>Homecoming</em>, Amazon Prime’s unnerving dive into corporate memory manipulation. Instead of office workers getting their brains split in two, you’ve got Julia Roberts playing a caseworker at a facility that helps soldiers “adjust” back to civilian life. The plot twist is that the place is secretly drugging them to erase their memories so they can be redeployed without all that pesky PTSD. It’s super subtle at first, but you start picking up on the weirdness in certain moments—like when Walter (Stephan James), one of the soldiers, realizes his memories don’t quite add up anymore. </p><p>This will unquestionably give you <em>Severance</em> vibes, especially given how the characters slowly start questioning the system around them. And just like Lumon in <em>Severance</em>, the Geist Group hides all this shady stuff behind clean visuals and corporate lingo. <em>Homecoming</em> doesn’t have memory-splitting elevators, but the way it messes with identity and free will? Same energy. It begs the question: How much of yourself can you lose before you stop being you? That is <em>very</em> much in that Severance wheelhouse.</p></div><div><p>HBO’s <em>Westworld</em> is like <em>Severance</em>’s older, more violent predecessor—the one who swapped office cubicles for saloons but still spends way too much time pondering the nature of identity. At its core, <em>Westworld</em> is less about cowboys and more about control: synthetic humans waking up every day with no memory, forced into loops by a corporation that literally scripts their lives. That’s basically Innie Helly (Britt Lower) all over again, just with gunfights and philosophical monologues. </p><p>When Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) finds out he’s a host and that his memories were implanted to make him more manageable, it hits the same nerve as Mark S. slowly realizing the extent of Lumon’s manipulation. Both shows ask what makes you <em>you</em>—is it your memories, your choices, or the illusion of freedom in a system designed to break you? Swap the maze tattooed under a host’s scalp for the Severed Floor’s labyrinth of halls, and you’re staring at two sides of the same dystopian coin.</p></div><div><p> The surreal British drama series kicks off with a British spy, known only as Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), resigning from his job and immediately getting kidnapped and dumped in a surreal seaside “village” where everyone’s polite but nothing is real. It’s kind of like Lumon’s Severed Floor with beach views—he can’t leave, he doesn’t know who’s watching him, and every cheerful smile is just another layer of the trap.</p><p>In one episode he thinks he’s finally escaped, only to realize the whole escape was staged, just another manipulation, much like when Mark in <em>Severance </em>thinks he’s getting answers but it turns out to be just another corporate trick. Both shows are obsessed with the idea of autonomy. In <em>Severance</em>, they split your mind in two; in <em>The Prisoner</em>, they just scramble it.</p></div><div><p><em>Max Headroom</em> is like <em>Severance</em> if you cranked the TV static to eleven and sprinkled in some 80s corporate paranoia. The show kicks off with Edison Carter (Matt Frewer), a journalist in a dystopian future where TV networks literally kill to keep ratings up. After he uncovers something shady, he crashes his bike and ends up in a coma—so the network copies his brain and accidentally creates Max (Frewer), this glitched-out digital version of himself who starts causing chaos on-air. It’s kind of like if Lumon took Mark’s consciousness and uploaded it into a sarcastic TV personality just to see what happens. Actually, Apple might need to greenlight that show.</p><p>There’s a remarkable scene in which Edison watches Max mock the very system that created him, and it feels a lot like Innie Helly trying to protest her own existence on the Severed Floor. Both shows are obsessed with identity being co-opted by corporations—Max is literally a personality split from his original self, used for corporate gain, just like the Innies. The vibe’s different—neon-soaked and jittery instead of sterile and quiet—but the core idea remains: when a company takes control of your identity, whatever’s left is just a fragment shaped to serve their needs.</p></div><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a></span> walked so <em>Severance</em> could spiral—it’s the OG of taking familiar experiences and shifting them ever-so-slightly to explore the dread and existential horror under the surface of everyday life. It’s an anthology series, yeah, but so many episodes tap into the unsettling experience of characters realizing their lives are being scripted by someone else. In the episode “Five Characters in Search of an Exit,” a group of strangers wakes up in a strange cylinder with no memory, trying to make sense of where they are or who they were—basically the severed floor with circus music. </p><p>They fight to escape, only to learn they’re just toys in a donation bin, a revelation which hits with the same gut-punch as Innie Helly discovering her Outie sees her as a thing, not a person. And then there’s “The Obsolete Man,” in which a librarian is put on trial in a society that’s erased books and individuality—the same sterile dread as <em>Severance</em>, the same confrontation with systems erasing people’s worth. <em>Severance</em> might wear a sleeker suit, but it’s still circling the idea that when someone else controls your story, your identity becomes just another tool shaped to serve their design.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Severance, </em>Netflix’s popular sci-fi anthology series <em>Black Mirror </em>lives in that sweet spot where tech meets trauma, asking what happens when the systems we build to “optimize” life end up hollowing us out. Take “White Christmas,” in which people’s consciousnesses get trapped in tiny smart home devices—basically Innie Mark, but inside a glorified Alexa, forced to make toast for an eternity. Or “USS Callister,” in which people are copied into a game and stripped of their autonomy—just like the Innies, they remember pain and crave freedom, but are locked inside a reality someone else designed. </p><p>Even “Nosedive” hits that <em>Severance</em> nerve, showing how curated personas can choke out real identity. Both shows are haunted by this question: when your thoughts, your choices, your self are filtered through a corporate or digital lens, what part of you is still truly yours? <em>Severance</em> may focus on fluorescent lights and break room therapy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span> already warned us—what we give up for comfort, productivity, or control might be the very thing that makes us human. </p></div><div><p>Innie and Outie Mark S’s little VHS kerfuffle at the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965"><em>Severance</em> Season 2</a></span> is child’s play compared to the mutli-season blood feud between hacker supreme Elliott Alderson (Rami Malek) and his alter ego, Mr. Robot. The award-winning USA Network drama follows Elliott and his developmentally stunted and perpetually traumatized gang of digital anarchists, known as F Society, as they try to free humanity from the shackles of evil corporation E Corp (Get it?) while also avenging the deaths of a few of their parents at the greedy hands of its senior executives. Not only does <em>Mr. Robot </em>feature the best performance in Malek’s sensational career; it’s also one of the only shows from the last decade to match <em>Severance</em>’s<em>&nbsp;</em>unique blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi. While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814"><em>Mr. Robot</em></a></span> leans more into cybersecurity while <em>Severance</em>’s focus is on sci-fi consciousness splitting, the show does a brilliant (and at times better) job of illustrating the internal struggles between two diametrically opposed halves of the same person.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Robot shoots and almost kills Elliott, takes over his consciousness without his consent to plan a deadly attack, and uses his childhood trauma to manipulate him. That alone is enough to draw parallels between <em>Mr. Robot</em> and <em>Severance. </em>There’s also the mysterious and diabolical corporate overlords of both shows, the computer work leading to real-world consequences, and the, at times, claustrophobic cinematography that really makes these two shows cousins from the same dystopian family tree.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So even just five seconds of footage inside a sizzle reel inside a 60-minute Nintendo Direct was like mana from heaven when Team Cherry quietly re-affirmed a 2025 release window for <em>Silksong</em> on Switch 2 (and Switch 1), as well as PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. </p><p>But that’s not all. A few fresh screenshots surfaced as well, including a callback to a scene first teased back during the game’s February 2019 reveal when it was still planned as DLC for the original 2017 GOTY contender (though many fans didn’t actually discover <em>Hollow Knight</em> until it came to Switch the following year). The new image quickly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jtmndd/new_screenshots_from_jp_silksong_page/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jtmndd/new_screenshots_from_jp_silksong_page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">racked up 6.9k likes on Reddit</a></span> (nice) and shows protagonist Hornet sitting on a bench in the city Bellhart. </p><p>What exactly has changed? Well there’s combat UI now, for one. There’s also a lot more detail in the citizens crowding around the foreground while an increased soft focus has blurred out more of the homes in the city’s background. The image is sharper and more detailed, though most casual observers would probably be hard-pressed to tell you which one was from six years ago and which only surfaced this week. “OMG IS THIS REAL,” wrote one fan on Reddit. “Yup it’s real,” responded another. “We’re so fucking back rn.”<br></p><p>A few more new screenshots surfaced which also parallel scenes previously teased in more recent screenshots from the PlayStation Store. <em>Hollow Knight</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mossbag69/status/1909250005178757536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mossbag69/status/1909250005178757536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">superfan account Mossbag</a></span> has cataloged them:</p><p>2025 is currently shaping up to be a massive year for sequels that fans have been waiting forever for. It will only have been eight years since <em>Hollow Knight</em> first came out. Meanwhile it’s been 11 years since the last <em>Mario Kart </em>first hit Wii U, and over 12 since the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> launched. Time will tell if they all manage to live up to the ever-skyrocketing hype. But some super fans have mixed feelings about the long waits finally being over. “In a weird way, there’s a part of me that’s not ready for the end,” wrote the Daily Silksong News <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DailySilksong/status/1907437416643805303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DailySilksong/status/1907437416643805303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account on April 2</a></span>, which posts YouTube videos every day about how little news there is about <em>Silksong</em>. </p><p>A recent video by the <em>Hollow Knight</em> archive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-IFzSITBbI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-IFzSITBbI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpfully catalogs what the last six years have been like for fans</a></span>. All footage of the game that currently exists totals less than four minutes. Even including screenshots from all the official blog posts, and press exclusives only gets the video up to six and a half. Few sequels have the weight of immeasurable expectations on them like <em>Silksong </em>does, thought it’s one of a number of upcoming sequels aiming to match or surpass the magic of the originals including <em>Hades 2</em>, <em>Slay the Spire 2</em>, and <em>Enter the Gungeon 2</em>. No matter how they finally turn out, they’ll all have something else in common as well: they’ll all be on Switch 2. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The promised Schedule 1 April 7 update has arrived. TVGS—the game’s solo developer—has added many new features, including handy new Pawn and Boutique shops as the game enters a new beta test. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> aptly has a lot of content logged in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> diary. Developer TVGS has lots of ideas and ways to keep its cornucopia of kingpins coming back for more. It’s probably for the best as they fend off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringement claims</a> from rival title Drug Dealer Simulator—although it’s reported there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Either way, a new update has dropped. It expands on Schedule 1’s foundations and is only a snippet of what’s to come.</p>

<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-interior-and-functionality-added">Pawn Shop Interior and Functionality Added</h3>



<p>There are already a fair few buildings in Schedule 1. But they won’t stop being built as a new Pawn Shop is open where: “You can now <strong>sell pretty much anything (excluding product)</strong> to Mick at the pawn shop.”</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a> needs to wait for customers, unfortunately. But anything else you can get your hands on is fair game. It’s a good way to make extra cash to spend on new items.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-boujee-boutique-awaits">A Boujee Boutique Awaits</h3>



<p>Also included in the April 7 Schedule 1 update is the new “Bleuballs Boutique.” I’m choosing my words carefully here, but if you’re old enough to play Schedule 1, there’s already a good chance you know the meaning behind the store’s name.</p>



<p>I’ll avoid this topic like the plague and say it’s another fab addition to the game. You can find expensive jewelry watches here, and it’s best that you make some money at the Pawn Shop or by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-calculator-guide-how-to-maximise-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximizing your profits</a> before buying anything!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/20-overlooked-nintendo-switch-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After eight years, the Nintendo Switch is approaching its final days, and from its ashes will rise the Switch 2. But before you put away your Switch in the closet for one last time, you should make sure you haven’t missed your chance to play some overlooked gems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While everyone with a Switch has probably played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and, of course, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are dozens of other Switch games that still shine bright on Nintendo’s hybrid console that you may have heard of, but didn’t get around to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get it, time is limited, budgets might be tight, and there are too many games. But go back and check out these Switch games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-ways-switch-2-is-better-than-switch">before the Switch 2.</a> You won’t regret it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">20 Overlooked Nintendo Switch Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">20. Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/16/firstmins-br-1679003427567.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">An origin story for everyone’s favorite demon-slaying witch, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a gorgeous puzzle platformer presented in a beautiful storybook art style. But fans of Bayonetta’s action combat will still find classic, button-mashing combos here too. Ultimately, Bayonetta Origins is a worthy addition to the series that may have been overlooked given its prequel nature and drastically different art style.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">19. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/switch-hyrulewarriorsaoc-wave1-screenshot-01-1623786264573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynasty Warriors/musou-genre is a perfect template for all manner of crossovers, including The Legend of Zelda. While The Age of Calamity might not be considered canon to the events of the beloved Breath of the Wild, there’s something incredibly gratifying about taking on the role of either Link or any of the other Breath of the Wild Champions and defending Hyrule from thousands of invading enemies. If you’re a fan of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom but haven’t ventured into Age of Calamity, it’s worth a trip back in time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">18. New Pokemon Snap</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/26/screenshot-10-1622058394865.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For years fans have dreamed of a long-awaited sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Pokemon Snap. And they got their wish in 2021 with the New Pokemon Snap for the Nintendo Switch. It’s very much a situation where New Pokemon Snap gives you more of everything you loved in the original, from more Pokemon to take snapshots of to plenty of secrets hidden throughout the various biomes you’ll traverse. While the original N64 Pokemon Snap game has its diehard fans who no doubt eagerly played the sequel, new fans deserve to check out one of the most beloved and unique Pokemon spinoffs ever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">17. Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/22/kirby-blogroll-1647980999035.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After 13 games, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the first fully 3D Kirby game in the entire series, and it takes full advantage of the additional dimension. While Kirby is still able to suck in enemies and objects to gain their powers, the new 3D environments are fully explorable, letting Kirby roam free for the first time. This makes new abilities like turning into a straight-up car especially useful for exploration. While Kirby has always been a reliable mainstay in the Nintendo stable, it’d be a shame to let the Switch era pass without playing one of the best Kirby games in the series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">16. Paper Mario: The Origami King</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/05/14/switch-papermariotheorigamiking-screen-43-1589480636902.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a reason why the Paper Mario sub-series is so beloved. Between the charming art style and the puzzle RPG style gameplay that departs from the platformer action of the mainline Mario games, the Paper Mario series is for anyone who has a soft spot for unique aesthetics. And thanks to a fully explorable open world, The Origami King might be one of the most beautiful Paper Mario games in the whole series. While combat isn’t as satisfying as past games, The Origami King makes up for it with visual splendor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/01/11/switch-donkeykongcountrytropicalfreeze-nd0111-scrn-08-1515703480191.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll scream it from the treetops until everyone finally listens – Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is one of the best 2D platformers of all time, and more people need to play it! It’s not for the faint of heart though, as Tropical Freeze’s fast-paced platforming challenges will test even the most hardened Super Mario players. You’ll frantically climb up crumbling icebergs, bounce across jiggly cubes of jello, and do so much more on DK’s quest to retake his home island. It’s rare – and extremely fun – to face this much difficulty in a Nintendo game, and Tropical Freeze makes it worth your effort by pairing its challenge with gorgeous graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and incredibly tight controls. All platformer fans owe it to themselves to try out this modern run-and-jump masterpiece.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Fire Emblem Engage</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/13/fire-emblem-engage-blogroll-1670895006514.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The most successful Fire Emblem game of the Nintendo era was Fire Emblem: Three Houses, but you shouldn't overlook the second Switch game, Fire Emblem Engage. Narratively, Engage isn’t as cohesive as Three Houses, but it makes up for it by bringing back fan-favorite characters from past Fire Emblem games through “the multiverse.” What’s more, tactics RPG fans will likely find Engage is actually more of a throwback to old-school SRPGs, with smaller maps for tighter combat situations and a difficulty that can ramp up to punishing levels if you’re feeling like you want to really test your strategic acumen.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/11/02/wiiutokyomiragesessionsfegameplay02jpg-fe220b.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem crossover but set in the backdrop of Japan’s idol music culture? Sign me up. While this might not be what anyone might have expected when it was announced Atlus would develop a Fire Emblem SMT crossover, the poppy, colorful mashup that we got deserves your time thanks to a breezy mix of Fire Emblem and SMT RPG combat and a bubblegum art style that’s worth the trip, despite the localization toning down some of the heavier themes around fame and fan culture.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Astral Chain</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/02/14/switch-astralchain-screen-moviecut-11-1550106342828.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astral Chain is one of those experiences that you need to play to truly understand its greatness, though anyone who has played any of Platinum's other action games will at least have an idea of what to expect. The combat is fluid and flashy and has enough variance when swapping between the summonable living weapons (called “Legion”) to keep things interesting from start to finish. Meanwhile, the bosses are challenging enough to test your mastery over each of these unique Familiars. Outside of the high-octane combat, you’ll be exploring the cyberfuturistic world and investigating incidents and solving cases. And then there is a whole Astral Plane to explore that is filled with platforming, battles, and puzzle challenges to overcome, and which feel almost like old-school dungeons from other Nintendo franchises. The only thing keeping Astral Chain from being more widely recognized is its exclusivity to the Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/03/mario-header-1667511769697.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rabbid Peach might have turned heads as a funny meme, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is no joke. This strategy RPG that combines the world of Mario and Ubisoft’s Rabbids is pure fun thanks to the action-focused combat that lets you combine different characters and upgrades for some massive combos. Whether you’re a Mario fan who’s never played a Rabbids game, or more rare, the Rabbids fan who never played a Mario game, these two unlikely flavors turn out to be pretty great together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/ttyd-blogroll-1716244234363.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Paper Mario: The Origami King, The Thousand Year Door is a ground-up remake of the beloved GameCube release. But as it’s one of the most beloved Paper Mario games in the whole series, its redone visuals, music, and gameplay improvements mean it’s now one of the best Paper Mario games of all time. Come for Mario’s swashbuckling treasure hunt to save Peach and the town of Rogueport, but stay for all the charm and gameplay excellence the Paper Mario franchise is known for. If you’ve never tried out one of Mario’s paper-based spinoffs, this is where to begin hands down.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. F-Zero 99</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/14/fzero99-blogroll-1694701824753.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">F-Zero fans weren’t sure how to feel when the series’ long-awaited return after 20 years of dormancy was a 99-player battle royale, but F-Zero 99 surprised us all and – thanks to a healthy amount of post-launch content updates – has turned into a top-tier entry. Racing against 98 players is exhilarating, and even though some of F-Zero’s trademark precision is gone, it’s replaced by the thrill of slamming into your opponents to devastate their health bar while taking careful precautions to preserve your own. And strategically planning when to use the faster – but limited – Skyway can lead to incredible comeback finishes that get your blood pumping. F-Zero 99 wasn’t the game anyone was asking for, but it was somehow the one we needed to get the series back on track.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Pikmin 3 Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/08/05/switch-pikmin3deluxe-screen-12-1596666837684.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikmin 3 was such a delight when it was released; it had been nine years since Pikmin 2 and many fans wondered when the franchise would make a return. Thankfully it did and though it wasn’t the massive upgrade like we eventually got in Pikmin 4, the game looked great and was a fun addition to the franchise that expanded it in important ways. Pikmin 3 introduced two new Pikmin types (Rock and Winged), better controls of your non-Pikmin protagonists (all of which were new to the franchise), and a solid amount of extra content to sink our teeth into. This was all made even better with Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch, which added even more content, co-op for the story mode, and the Piklopedia, which was notably absent in the original release. Pikmin 3 in general is also one of the funnier entries in the franchise as the three leaders you control all have distinct personalities, and it was always a treat to see how they would describe Citrus Lumps (Oranges) or Cupid’s Grenade (Cherries). Pikmin 3 Deluxe may not be at the top of most Pikmin fans lists but it is still worth exploring to collect fruit and make that sweet sweet juice. No Pikmin collection would be complete without it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/09/12/screenshot6jpg-b34627.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense that Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was one of the first games Nintendo brought over to the Switch from the Wii U. This is a delightful, ingenious little puzzle platformer where Captain Toad must reach the end of the level without being able to jump. The reason? His backpack is too heavy. It’s not the most complex platformer, but every level is a delightful brain teaser, and great to play in short bursts and on the go. A perfect Switch game, basically. While the Wii U was full of overlooked gems in its own right, this is one of its biggest treasures that made its way to the far more popular Switch, and where it deserves its own recognition.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Game Builder Garage</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/27/switch-gbg-screencaptures06-buttonnodonhighlight-scrn-1622120080831.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No one talks about Game Builder Garage and it's such a damn shame. If something like this had existed when I was a kid, I would have devoured it, throwing myself fully into its interface and creating gobs and gobs of bespoke games to play and show off. Nintendo basically built a simplified game engine to teach people, well, how to build games. It's right there in the name! But it's not a coding tutorial, nor is it a simple level-editor like Super Mario Maker. You progress through Game Builder Garage by completing charming lessons on building different types of games and what those types of games involve, basically building algorithms with the charm of a Nintendo-created interface. If you've ever installed a game engine on your computer only to throw your hands in the air after a few YouTube tutorials, buy this game. Play it through. Build a few games in it. Then move onto something bigger. You'll be ready. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Xenoblade Chronicles Series</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/xenobladechroniclesxdefinitiveeditionlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1742311263070.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Across four games, Monolith Soft has created some of the biggest, most beautiful open worlds ever realized on the Nintendo Switch. Xenoblade Chronicles 1, 2, and 3, as well as the spinoff Xenoblade Chronicles X, are what happens when you take old-school Japanese RPG sensibilities and marry them to modern-ish technology. The results are sweeping, operatic stories about warring civilizations, ancient gods, cool robots, and cooler swords, with a breathtaking open world to explore fully. Combined, the Xenoblade games will likely take hundreds of hours to finish… and it’ll be worth every minute.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/31/q654jvje3ld9-vvj8afklinppmgojssnjfxywuj-u8-1680289457483.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe is the perfect counterpart to The Forgotten Land, which we already celebrated on this list. While The Forgotten Land is a 3D adventure primarily focused on single player, Return to Dreamland Deluxe is one of the pink puffball’s strongest 2D outings, with the best multiplayer the series has ever seen. Tearing through levels and enemies with four Kirbys on screen is a blast, and Return to Dreamland’s huge amount of levels and collectibles to find will keep you and your friends entertained for a long time. It might be the best way to introduce new gamers to platformers too, as you only fail if player 1 dies and players 2-4 can seamlessly drop in and out at any time. The Deluxe Switch version also adds an entirely new epilogue and a wide selection of returning subgames from across Kirby’s history, complete with achievements to chase and costumes to unlock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Ring Fit Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2019/10/02/switch-ringfitadventure-screen-02-1570055359872.bmp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike some of the other games on this list, Ring Fit Adventure was a best-seller for Nintendo. The question though is how many of you stuck with it through the very end and not just until you forgot about your New Year’s resolution? Well you better get back to it, because while it’s an ingenious way to get active, the actual RPG-element of Ring Fit Adventure is no joke. Using the fitness ring to venture forth and defeat a “bootilicious” evil dragon sounds absurd, but Ring Fit Adventure does its absolute best to keep you engaged every literal step of the way. Power up your character and your body in Ring Fit Adventure if you haven’t already.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Metroid Dread</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/switch-metroiddread-screen-060-1623784088304.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch has quietly become the home to Metroid games. Between older Metroid games available on Nintendo Switch Online and a splendid remaster (more on that in a moment), Samus rules the Switch. Nothing showcases this more than the Switch’s original Metroid game, Metroid Dread. A throwback to the older, 2D Metroid games, this 2.5D search-action game breathed new life into the series by reminding fans just how scary these games can be, thanks to the terrifying E.M.M.I. machines that hunt Samus relentlessly through the claustrophobic corridors of Dread, earning the name and more. While Metroid might not immediately come to mind as an overlooked franchise, consider that Metroid Dread — while one of the best-selling Metroid games in the series — has only sold 3 million copies, which is less than games like 1-2-Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Metroid Prime Remastered</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/28/blogroll-thumbnail-metroidprime-1677577220960.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metroid Prime 4 looking increasingly likely to be Nintendo Switch’s swan song (and maybe even a Switch 2 launch title), what better time to check out where it all started? But make no mistake, Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch isn’t just a simple re-release. The graphical overhaul needs to be seen to be believed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime is one of the best video games of all time. Anyone who says different is just trying to get a rise out of you. Locked away on GameCube (and eventually the Nintendo Wii), this absolute classic seemed like it was destined to live on only in our fondest GameCube memories. But then one day, out of the blue, Nintendo said to us all "friends, today you can play a remastered version of one of our most incredible and important games, and you can play it on your Nintendo Switch." And wow, did they ever hit it out of the park with this one. It's not just some up-res version of the GameCube version, or even the Wii version. It's a proper remake, graphically upgraded to modern standards with tweaks to the controls and gameplay to make it feel right at home on the Nintendo Switch. Better still, unlike so many modern remakes, it was only $39.99! Unheard of in an era where games from the last generation get a shiny coat of paint and a $70 price tag. Everything that made the original special made its way to the modern era expertly. The sense of isolation, exploration, and tension all made the leap to HD brilliantly. And yet Metroid Prime Remastered was by all accounts a sales disappointment. Really, I'm just disappointed in you for not having played it. Yes, you. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are our favorite Switch games that we think more people should check out before the coming of the Switch 2. Heck, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Switch 2’s backward compatibility</a>, it’s probably the best time to try them now and pick up the journey when the Switch 2 is released.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With Switch 2's $450 price tag, some have expressed that it's unaffordable. Well, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser agrees, saying that those who can't afford it can still play the original Switch. Due to the recent Trump tariffs, it's also possible that Switch 2 could become more expensive in the US.</p><p>"We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2's] price point," Bowser explained in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC</a>. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so [people] still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in."</p><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">defended Switch 2's price point</a>, saying that the cost of everything goes up, and also that its new features justified it. Nintendo has also previously stated that Trump's tariffs were not factored into the price itself. Preorders of Switch 2 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed in the US</a> as Nintendo reconsiders tariffs and market conditions, so some have theorized that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">system might actually end up becoming more expensive</a>.</p><p>Others have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ju0g5l/nintendos_doug_bowser_channeling_the_ghost_of_don/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comparing Bowser's comments to former Xbox chief Don Mattrick's from 2013</a>. Following the 2013 Xbox One reveal, Mattrick stated that those who didn't have a constant online connection for Xbox One could just stick with Xbox 360. He left <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/don-mattrick-leaving-microsoft-for-zynga/1100-6410944/" data-ref-id="1100-6410944">Microsoft for Zynga less than two months later</a>.</p><p>Despite the tariffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-stock-is-already-in-the-us-as-nintendo-prepares-for-launch-demand/1100-6530675/" data-ref-id="1100-6530675">Switch 2 stock is already in the US</a> as Nintendo prepares for launch demand.

			<p>A new The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC hotfix was released today, introducing a very welcome new feature and some stability improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.0 hotfix doesn't address many of the issues found in the newly released port of the second entry in the series, but it introduces definite improvements with the addition of an upscale sharpness slider that provides players improved control over sharpening. The game definitely was over-sharpened at launch, so this new feature is extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the upscale sharpness slider, the new The Last of Us Part II Remastered hotfix brings mouse input changes to improve detection of subtle aiming movements and fixes a couple of crashes happening in very specific scenarios. The full patch notes for the hotfix can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2531310/view/526465274493273361?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the PC port released last week by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">report</a>. For more information on what the Remastered version brings over the original PlayStation 4 release, you can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack<em>&nbsp;</em>follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>DLCs focused around various other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-planet-zoo-expansion" rel="nofollow">regions</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-dlc-pack-adds-southeast-asian-animals-aplenty" rel="nofollow">world</a>, adding seven new animals for you to put in your zoo, as well as lots of new scenery items and more.</p>

<p>First up, this DLC brings what is perhaps the most iconic American animal of all time in the form of the coyote, which "can run up to 40 miles per hour", according to Frontier. Hopefully, it'll find a happy home in your zoo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=PRL17eui 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=iterDqrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seven new American animals will be available in the&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>Americas Animal Pack DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Your next animal is the ocelot, a Central and South American wildcat that can variously be seen hanging out in trees, stalking the land, and even swimming.</p>

<p>Five more animals are included as part of this pack as well: the greater rhea, the white-faced saki, the American flamingo, the bush dog, and the Bighorn sheep. As Frontier says, these animals "showcase some of the diverse and rich wildlife that makes the Americas so unique".</p>

<p>As well as the above animals, you'll also find more than 80 new scenery pieces to put in your zoo to help your guests feel more at home, including new fabric flags, ironwork lamps, and paper fans.</p>

<p>A brand new campaign scenario will also be made available in which you'll be able to learn about the animals included as part of the DLC. You'll be helping "the notorious Dominic Myers" transform his public image and build a successful zoo in Central America.</p>




<p><em>Planet Zoo</em>'s&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack DLC will be available on April 15th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3473820/Planet_Zoo_Americas_Animal_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, although no release date has yet been revealed for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-ps5-xbox-announcement" rel="nofollow">console versions</a> of the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>One research company has lowered its sales forecast for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, due in part to "pricing" concerns surrounding the impact of tariffs. DFC Intelligence is downgraded its global Switch 2 sales forecast for 2025 from 17 million to 15 million units. Even at 15 million in 2025, the Switch 2 would be the "fastest-selling console system ever," DFC said.</p><p>The original Switch, along with the Wii and the PS4, took a year or more to reach 15 million in sales. DFC is predicting the Switch 2 will reach that mark from the June 5 launch to the end of 2025, or about 7 months.</p><p>DFC said its downgraded forecast is tied to "supply and pricing."</p><p>"With tariffs and uncertain pricing Nintendo may choose to scale back its manufacturing. If prices increase substantially due to tariffs, a significant portion of prospective buyers are likely to hold back on a purchase until prices come down," DFC said.</p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo has not announced any official sales projections for the Switch 2. More insight is expected to come in May when Nintendo releases its next earnings briefing and talks to analysts and investors about the console and the company's overall outlook.</p><div tabindex="0"

at $500 or more. At $450, the Switch represents a "solid value," DFC said. However, after Nintendo delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> due to the impact of tariffs, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">fears that Nintendo might announce a higher price point. </a></p><p>Some experts believe the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">Switch 2 will sell extremely well out of the gate</a> due to pent-up demand and because people who buy shiny new products right away are not historically known to be price-sensitive.</p><p>DFC said on a longer-term outlook, the upper limit for Switch 2 sales is "enormous."</p><p>"The Switch 2 continues an established system and the ability to act as a portable device taps into Nintendo's rich history of offering portable/console experiences," DFC said.</p><p>Nintendo peaked in terms of hardware sales in 2007-2009 with the Wii and DS combining to sell 40 million-50 million units annually. But DFC said the Switch 2 is capable of reaching an "even larger share" than the original Switch on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5.

            <p>The release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> later this year is expected to boost games industry revenue to a record $92.7bn by 2027, a new report claims.</p>
<p>Between 2024 and 2027, that would be a growth in PC market share of 2.6 percent and console growth of 7.0 percent, according to <a href="https://hubs.ly/Q03fJDsw0/">games market intelligence firm Newzoo</a>.</p>
<p>Following a boost from $67.6bn in 2019 to $80.9bn in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, industry revenue has stagnated. Yet that's set to rise from $80.2bn in 2024 to $85.2bn this year, and continue in a positive direction.</p>

<p>Console game sales are expected to rebound in 2025, carried by GTA 6, while Switch 2's release will boost both hardware and software. PC growth, meanwhile, is focused on in-game revenue from mature and free-to-play games.</p>
<p>Newzoo states the absence of major technical, content, or distribution innovation has precluded higher player growth this decade.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/older-games-like-fortnite-account-for-over-60-of-playtime-new-report-suggests">last year's annual PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo</a>, older games dominate playtime. From January 2021 to December 2024, around 10 games consistently made up 50 percent of all playtime across all platforms: the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Roblox, Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, and Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Fortnite alone accounted for 9.3 percent of total playtime in 2024, up from 9.1 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>The report notes that new games on PC struggle to capture playtime share from established games, while those older games are leaning on nostalgia to retain players both short- and long-term. Fortnite achieved this with the return of its OG map, which the likes of PUBG and Call of Duty have imitated.</p>
<p>Newer games are more popular on console, with PlayStation featuring the highest playtime rates for recent games. That said, across all consoles, new game hours are dominated by annual franchises like EA Sports FC and Call of Duty.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/newzoo-2025-10games.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>The study also investigated whether players are playing fewer games and found the proportion of players engaging with three games or fewer has generally increased across all platforms.</p>
<p>Steam users are more likely to play a larger quantity of games, though this is skewed by a greater number of less expensive indie and AA games. Over on PlayStation, indie and AA games make up less than 12 percent of games played as big AAA releases dominate. On Xbox and its Game Pass subscription, indies and AA fare better, but players overwhelmingly still prefer AAA games.</p>

<p>As players focus on fewer games, this means existing live-service games have more difficulty attracting new players, while premium games struggle to hit sales targets, the report suggests.</p>
<p>Of course, while the boost to the industry is welcome, part of the growth from Switch 2 and GTA 6 isn't just from sales numbers but the increase in game prices too.</p>
<p>Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World will cost £75, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">Nintendo has since stated this won't "set a benchmark"</a> for future releases. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">Switch 2 editions of original Switch games, meanwhile, will come in at £65</a>.</p>
<p>As for GTA 6, the price is yet to be determined, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">reports have suggested it could cost £80 on its release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hades 2 fans desperate for the game’s full launch can only pick it up on Nintendo Switch 2 at release. It’s currently locked in as a Switch 2 console exclusive for the time being, with a PlayStation and Xbox launch coming later.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-nintendo-switch-2-release-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 exclusives</a> keep coming. We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Shocking. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
