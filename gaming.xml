            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-june-2024-have-been-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The June 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been confirmed, with Sony offering up a trio of games for all PS Plus subscribers – Essentials, Extra and Premium. Headlining this month’s selection is Streets of Rage 4, the retro revival of the classic beat ’em up series.</p>
<p>The announcement has come with the big Days of Play 2024 promotion launch, which will bring big discounts to subscriptions, hardware, and across the PS Store. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/day-of-play-2024-adds-psvr-2-games-to-ps-plus-premium-kicks-off-huge-ps-store-sale/">Head here for more details</a>.</p>



<p>The following three&nbsp;games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 4th June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Streets of Rage 4 is a modern classic, for side-scrolling beat ’em up fans. Published by DotEmu, whose reputation for retro revivals was already well established, it was another big success story. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">9/10 Streets of Rage 4 review</a>, Aran said, “The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.</p>


<p>The same can’t really be said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/07/aew-fight-forever-review/">AEW Fight Forever</a>, which thoroughly disappointed our resident wrestling head, Ade. So let’s move right along.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake was a solid if unremarkable new platformer based on the incredibly popular cartoon series. “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a decent 3D platformer filled with all the SpongeBob humour you’d expect, but it feels like a step back when compared to the far more imaginative Battle for Bikini Bottom: Reheydrated,” Steve said <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">in our review</a>.</p>

<p>What do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the May 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab May’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 6th June, but with the Euros just about to get going, you’ll be able to get EA Sports FC 24 through 18th June. What a nice surprise for inattentive football likers?</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>EA Sports FC 24</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong> (PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Tunic</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Destiny 2: Lightfall</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
</ul>

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 includes 2,500 pieces, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgreat-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">is available for preorder</a> now for $299.99, and will start shipping out in September.</p><p>The set covers two different <em>Zelda</em> games: <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Breath of the Wild, </em>letting you build the Great Deku Tree in green summer foliage or pink spring cherry blossoms. It features several versions of Link, including Link as a child and an adult in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>’s green Hero of Time tunic and Link in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s blue Champion’s tunic.</p><p>According to Lego, the Great Deku Tree set will have interactive features including the ability to animate the tree’s facial expressions. The set also includes a skulltula, koroks, Hestu waving his signature maracas, fairies, and Princess Zelda herself.</p><p>Several Nintendo properties including <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong </em>have gotten the Lego treatment in recent years. There’s been pent-up demand: Lego has rejected fan-submitted ideas for a <em>Zelda</em>-themed set for years, going so far as to outright ban <em>Zelda </em>submissions back in 2022 due to “license conflict.” However, rumors regarding an official <em>Zelda</em> Lego set <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23581768/legend-of-zelda-lego-leak-jean-grey-forever-promobricks">started popping up</a> in February of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s still a truly special game that sparked what I’d argue is one of PlayStation’s most underrated series. It would be nice if this led to Sony supporting the series further with a fifth entry to resolve 2013’s <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s devastating cliffhanger, but PlayStation will never give me that relief.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sucker Punch Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of these games are being added to the PS2 section of the Classics catalog as part of Sony’s Days of Play sale.

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Oh, look. It’s been a picosecond since the last Steam sales event. No doubt many of you took advantage of the last one – the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/balatro-stellaris-and-more-are-in-steams-endless-replayability-fest/">Endless Replayability Fest</a>. Well, don’t put your money away just yet, as we’re already onto the next one.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Beginning yesterday, the Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest (and breathe) offers discounts on a series of well-known and slightly less well-known games from, well, Open World Survival Crafting games. You’ve got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest 2024: Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Q-LiQqpPww?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>

Want 30% off <em>Sons of the Forest</em>? Of course you do. How about 33% off <em>Project Zomboid</em>? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get <em>Stranded Deep</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, or <em>Subnautica</em> for 50% off each. Even <em>Palworld</em> is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.</p> <h2 id="h-summer-lovin" data-injectable="false">Summer lovin’</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">These events seem to come around more often these days. However, we’re not quite at the big <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-steam-summer-sale-2024-begin/">Steam Summer Sale</a> just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/sales/history/?event=160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> countdown if you really want to see exactly when it’s scheduled to begin.</p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Crafting and survival games feel like they shouldn’t be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="false">There are definitely more than a few in the sale that I’m keen to try out; <em>Sons of the Forest</em>, <em>Project Zomboid</em>, maybe even <em>Enshrouded</em>. Can I afford all these games? Check back with me later.</p>

But not any regular old <em>Prince of Persia</em>; <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-real-and-coming-to-early-access-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, and it’s pretty easy to tell what makes it special.</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Notably, Evil Empire and Ubisoft have launched the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Early Access build</a> of the <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, and though it is still early to say whether it’s a slam dunk, it sure is a whole lot of fun. There are some really interesting tidbits about this game, mind: firstly, even though it is being published by Ubisoft, <em>Rogue Prince </em>does not necessitate a Ubisoft Connect login. Secondly, the game both is, and is not, reminiscent of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dead-cells-is-about-to-get-its-final-major-content-update-after-many-many-years-of-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the classic <em>Dead Cells</em></a>, which results in a fresh and exciting gameplay loop, even this early in its development.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Evil Empire</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-evil-empire-s-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-off-to-a-good-start" data-injectable="false">Evil Empire’s Rogue Prince of Persia is off to a good start</h2> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">With just under 200 reviews written at the time of writing, and a “Mostly Positive” review rating, <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em> already enjoys some amount of acclaim. The game itself is a relatively straightforward acrobatic platformer that doesn’t even try to hide its <em>Dead Cells</em> pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">On top of delightfully rotoscoped animations and character models, albeit delivered in a slightly different style than what we saw with <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Rogue Prince</em>‘s core gameplay loop consists of basically the same elements. A few tweaks here and there, granted, but anyone who’s spent any amount of time with <em>Dead Cells</em> will feel right at home here. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">Once again, players need to collect resources dropped by enemies to research new gear and gadgets. The Prince does so by repeatedly attempting to wall-run his way through hordes of magic-infused Huns, with the familiar choice of levels coming up every so often. The current build of the game has two boss encounters in tow and about half a dozen unique levels, which all comes together into a lovely proof-of-concept for what’s to come in the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">“We plan to be in Early Access for around a year, probably a little bit longer,” says Evil Empire on the game’s Steam page. “We plan to add all the good stuff – more levels, weapons, features, enemies, bosses, story acts and meta progression. Along the way we want to find out if there’s anything we can add to the core gameplay too. In fact, our plan is to double the amount of content from Early Access launch to 1.0.”</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">A solid plan, then. Given Evil Twin’s track record and what’s already on show with the <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, I can say I’m very much looking forward to what comes next. And don’t forget: if you’re not a fan of Early Access, there’s that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, equally delightful version of <em>Prince of Persia</em></a> that launched earlier this year.</p>

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Are you thrilled about the possibility of a new <em>Doom</em> game? If you’ve clicked on this article, chances are good you’re pretty pumped. There have been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rumors-are-swirling-around-a-possible-new-doom-reveal/">rumors about a new reveal</a> for a bit now, and we’ll find out whether it was worth getting excited soon enough.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, not only is there a chance that id Software could unveil a new <em>Doom</em> entry at this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, the game’s final title is said to be finalized. At one point, it was going to be called “<em>Year Zero</em>,” but it seems as though it’s going with “<em>The Dark Ages</em>.” It’s also said to have been in development for the past four years, so pretty much as soon as <em>Eternal</em> was complete.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="EXCLUSIVE: DOOM: The Dark Ages to be Revealed at Xbox Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLPkVRw3uMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">The Xbox Games Showcase will be taking place on June 9, and will be a chance for Microsoft to discuss some exclusive games in its upcoming roster, though it’s difficult to know exactly what’s going to be on the schedule. The show will be immediately followed by a deep dive into <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-look-at-the-slayer-s-past" data-injectable="false">A look at the Slayer’s past?</h2> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">While details about the new <em>Doom</em> are pretty scarce, the report and video above say there’s a chance we could be going back in time, perhaps to Medieval times. The title <em>The Dark Ages</em> does suggest it could take place in that time period, giving us a glimpse into the Doom Slayer’s life back in days of yore.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Of course, all expectations must be tempered at this point. As solid as these rumors sound, we’re best off waiting until June 9 to see what’s going to be confirmed. We’re also hoping we’ll get to see more <em>Avowed</em> during the showcase.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Playing my first <em>Doom</em> game as a young whippersnapper, I never thought the series would endure as much as it has. Although the team has changed over the decades, id Software’s legendary FPS is not just trying to keep its head above the water; it’s thriving in an increasingly competitive market. Here’s to more demon slaying with whatever’s on the horizon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After accidentally spoiling their own announcement earlier this morning, Microsoft officially revealed that <strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></strong> will be available Day One on Xbox Game Pass, albeit with a caveat.</p>

<p>Questions about whether, or how, <em>Call of Duty</em> would be on Game Pass have been bouncing around since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Buys Activision Blizzard, Bobby Kotick Staying As CEO">Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard</a>. While Microsoft took action to assure regulators, and players, that the game wouldn't be exclusive to Xbox with deals with various platform holders, and services, there haven't been any type of promises about what would happen with <em>Call of Duty </em>in regards to Microsoft's signature Game Pass service. While it's easy to point to things like Microsoft saying they put all their games on Game Pass day 1, it's easy to see why there'd be doubt with <em>Call of Duty </em>being one of the biggest gaming imps, and that Microsoft has been busy tripping over its own past statements lately, like around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Shuts Down Redfall and Hi-Fi Rush Creators">Tango Gameworks closure</a>.</p>



<p>On Xbox Wire today, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Day One with Xbox Game Pass">Microsoft formally announced </a>that they were going to be releasing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on Game Pass on Day 1, although it lacked other details. Speculation has abounded about an Xbox Game Pass price hike or a special <em>Call of Duty</em> tier of sorts for Game Pass, but as of today none of that has been revealed. Instead, the reveal was kept short, and to the point, while tying in a new trailer that was released today. The full reveal is set to happen on June 9th, right after the main Xbox showcase.</p>

<p><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> is the 5th numbered entry in the <em>Black Ops</em> subline (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops: </em><em>Cold War</em></a> is being counted as 5 it appears), and takes place during the Gulf War of the 1990s. A less talked about war nowadays, it lacks some of the controversy of other recent American wars like Vietnam or Iraq, while still providing a more contemporary setting and providing a major face people will know: Saddam Hussein. While these days best known for being targetted by the George W Bush administration for the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, just over a decade earlier Bush's father, George H. W. Bush was part of a coalition of nations that fought against Hussein after he had invaded Kuwait.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time that the Gulf War has been depicted in video games either. There have been around 20 or so games that are set in, or have scenarios that take place in the Gulf War, with several of them even taking their name from the war-ending Operation Desert Storm. Developers from companies like Bungie (<em>Operation: Desert Storm</em>, their first commercial game), and Ubisoft (<em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>) have produced games or levels that take place during the war, though most games that focused on it were released before the Iraq War of 2000s, which was much more controversial.</p>

            <p>After what has felt like forever for this Legend of Zelda-loving-Lego-nerd, the long-rumoured set based on The Great Deku Tree has been officially revealed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The upcoming Lego set will be a two-in-one number, with the option to recreate Ocarina of Time's Great Deku Tree or Breath of the Wild's. The Breath of the Wild version comes with a buildable Hestu figure, as you can see in the header image above, and a little cooking pot inside the tree himself and a Korok at the top. Also, check out the Deku Tree's blossom brows!</p>
<p>When it is in its Ocarina of Time form, meanwhile, users will also be able to build Link's treehouse from Kokiri Forest, which has a little Navi perched on the balcony.</p>

<p>On the minifigure side of things, there are four of them included: Classic Link, Classic Young Link, Breath of the Wild Link and Breath of the Wild Princess Zelda. Zelda has her Shiekah slate, while Link has the Master Sword and shields. There is also an ocarina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-zelda-set-to-feature-two-great-deku-tree-designs-rumours-suggest">as previously rumoured</a>.</p>
<p>This Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree Lego set has a total of 2500 pieces, and will cost £260. If you fancy a set for yourself, you <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">can pre-order it now</a> ahead of its launch on 1st September. Lego has set a limit for three sets per household to ensure fairness.</p>

After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166060/microsoft-just-accidentally-made-a-big-call-of-duty-announcement">premature notification</a> earlier today, an official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Xbox Wire blog post</a> has now revealed that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>will be available on Microsoft’s game subscription service later this year.</p><p>“We’re excited to confirm that Game Pass members will be able to jump into <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on day one with Game Pass,” says Megan Spurr, senior community lead of Xbox Game Pass. In a separate trailer from Xbox, Microsoft confirms <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be available on both Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC Game Pass.</p><p>The confirmation of a Game Pass release for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> installment comes after questions about <em>Call of Duty</em>’s availability on Xbox Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">I reported earlier this month</a>&nbsp;that Microsoft had been debating whether to put new releases of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>into Game Pass, with concerns from some at the company that the revenue generated from typical&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;sales would be undermined by Game Pass. Activision traditionally sells more than 20 million copies of <em>Call of Duty</em> on average, at around $70 each.</p><p>It’s still not clear whether Microsoft plans to raise the prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and the company hasn’t announced a release date for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> 6, so there are still many months to go until its eventual release on Game Pass. I understand Activision is currently targeting a late October release for <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which is set during the ’90s Gulf War.</p><p>Microsoft plans to provide further details about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>during a special stream after the main Xbox summer showcase on June 9th. The main Xbox showcase will feature a new <em>Gears of War</em> announcement, alongside the next <em>Doom</em> game. The showcase will also include a number of release dates for upcoming Xbox games like&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>,&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, May 28th: </strong>Article updated to confirm both Xbox Game Pass console and PC Game Pass availability.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="fpiAKY">PlayStation Plus subscribers’ free Essential games for the month of June are <em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em>, <em>AEW Fight Forever</em>, and <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29">Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Tuesday</a>. Players can download the trio of games beginning Tuesday, June 4.</p>
<p id="tlzjxX">Sony revealed June 2024’s monthly free PS Plus games as part of a larger Days of Play announcement, in which the company promised deals on PlayStation hardware and games, as well as bonus titles for the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. Days of Play 2024 runs from May 29 through June 12.</p>
<p id="QncNmD">June’s free monthly games for PS Plus Essential kick off with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22679702/spongebob-squarepants-nickelodeon-the-cosmic-shake-patrick-star-cartoon"><em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em></a>, the platformer adventure game in which SpongeBob and Patrick get wish-granting — and reality-shredding — Mermaid’s Tears. The duo don a variety of themed costumes to conquer medieval, Western, and prehistoric worlds. </p>
<p id="kwDrlG"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23778559/aew-fight-forever-review-roster-wrestlers-switch-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>AEW Fight Forever</em></a> is the wrestling arcade-style game that lets players mix it up as All Elite Wrestling superstars or play as their own customized wrestler. It’s the only place to get your Exploding Barbed Wire Death match fix on PlayStation this summer. </p>
<p id="W8lgzb"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/4/29/21240091/streets-of-rage-4-review-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> is the must-play side-scrolling belt-action beat-’em-up from Sega and developers LizardCube, Guard Crush, and DotEmu. <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> revitalized the Genesis-era franchise with the return of fan-favorite characters, great music, and combo-focused gameplay. As Polygon editor in chief Chris Plante said in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/4/29/21240091/streets-of-rage-4-review-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one">his review of the 2020 game</a>, “<em>Streets of Rage 4</em> is everything I could have wanted from a true Streets of Rage sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/5/28/24159038/best-korean-dramas-netflix-watch-summer-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="J8mg7W"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23964539/k-drama-history-american-korean-popularity-success-hallyu">Korean dramas</a> continue to be some of the most popular (and best!) pop culture in the world. And, now that Netflix is in the K-drama game, the streamer is investing lots of money in producing and distributing some of the most beloved East Asian dramas globally. The age of Peak TV means not only sorting through an immense amount of domestic, English-language TV options, but also a consistent flurry of foreign-language drama, including from Korea.</p>
<p id="SWRpAe">We’ve worked hard to find a variety of K-dramas to highlight below. While this means a diversity of genre — including a superhero family series, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22692220/squid-game-review-netflix"><em>Squid Game</em></a>-esque dark comedy, and a teen revenge drama poised to follow in the Netflix tradition of <em>Élite</em> — it also means a diversity of release format. Some of the dramas listed below have already premiered but are releasing new episodes weekly, while others are yet to come but will release all of their episodes in one go. Whether you’re looking for a marathon watch or the weekly release experience of yesteryear, we have something for you…</p>
<hr id="51y14R">
<h2 id="Tn5mlE"><strong>The Atypical Family</strong></h2>
<div id="pJdNH6"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CotipI30Bx8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1bRZuF"><strong>Release date:</strong> May 4th-June 9th <br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>Moving, My Roommate is a Gumiho</em></p>
<p id="zvK2gL">Last year, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23860210/hulu-moving-season-1-review-mcu-about-review">Hulu K-drama <em>Moving</em></a> proved that some of the best superhero storytelling is happening outside of the United States. This year, Netflix is getting in on the action, offering up a story about a family of superpowered individuals who are struggling to stay superpowered in a modern world that triggers conditions like depression, insomnia, bulimia, and smartphone addiction. </p>
<p id="GpWFo0">Jang Ki-yong (<em>My Roommate is a Gumiho</em>) stars as single father Bok Gwi-ju, a time traveler. When Gwi-ju begins to experience depression after the loss of his wife, he loses his power to travel through time. Meanwhile, the rest of his family are also struggling to hold onto their superpowers. When the mysterious Do Da-hee (<em>The 8 Show</em>’s Chun Woo-hee) enters Gwi-ju’s life, things begin to change in unexpected ways. Note: <em>The Atypical Family </em>has rightly been called out for its fatphobic handling of one character’s journey. If this is a deal breaker for you, then steer clear!</p>
<p id="gWdJuH"><em>The Atypical Family</em> began airing on May 4th, but is still in the middle of its season, with two episodes dropped on the streamer every weekend. The final episode is set to be released on June 9th.</p>
<h2 id="l9XEUZ"><strong>The 8 Show</strong></h2>
<div id="S1PDSz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvowLTLYJN0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="X3p18t"><strong>Release date: </strong>May 17th <br><strong>Episode count: </strong>8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>Squid Game, Alice in the Borderland, </em>that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Game">one episode of <em>Doctor Who</em></a></p>
<p id="udVbH9">If you’ve caught the trailer or first episode of <em>The 8 Show</em>, you might think it is a complete rip-off of <em>Squid Game</em>. While the new Netflix K-drama has some direct visual echoes of the cultural phenomenon, such as the Escher-style stairs or the numbered uniforms, the series is actually adapted from an existing <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/thriller/money-game/list?title_no=3254">webtoon story called <em>Money Game</em></a>. (But you better believe it was the unprecedented success of <em>Squid Game</em>, which remains Netflix’s most-watched show of all time, that got this adaptation greenlit.)</p>
<p id="g583V7">While there may be some similarities between<em> Squid Game</em> and <em>The 8 Show</em>, there are also some fundamental differences. For one, the cast of <em>The 8 Show </em>is much smaller, which makes the interpersonal dynamics much more concentrated. In the series, eight people are invited to appear on a reality variety TV show called <em>Money Game</em>. If the eight people can stand to live in an eight-story concrete fortress for 100 days, they get to split the winnings equally, which starts at 44.8 billion won (or around $33.6 million). To survive in the game, the group can decide to spend money on necessities such as food, water, and electricity—but it comes out of the winnings, and the cost is 1,000 times their normal price. </p>
<p id="i3UUx3">Another fundamental difference is in the respective tones of the shows. While <em>Squid Game</em> has its moments of comedy, for the most part it is played as a straight drama. From the looks of <em>The 8 Show</em>’s trailer, the series is much more of a black comedy, with the visual style playing up some of the absurdity of the situation in hyperbolic ways.</p>
<h2 id="8sXdsD"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h2>
<div id="9aBXPu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntczSnSogQ8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9M8YBI"><strong>Release date: </strong>June 7th<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 7<br><strong>Recommended for fans of:</strong> <em>Elite</em>, <em>Gossip Girl, SKY Castle, The Heirs, The Glory</em></p>
<p id="f7oaEG">In the grand tradition of <em>Elite</em> — and <em>Gossip Girl</em> before it — comes the next era of rich kid teen drama. <em>Hierarchy</em> is a revenge romance following a group of students at Jooshin High, a Korean private school for the 1%. The series stars Lee Chae-min (<em>Crash Course in Romance</em>) as Kang Ha, a mysterious transfer student who doesn’t seem to come from the same uber-privileged background as the rest of the student body... but who may have an agenda of his own. Roh Jeong-eui (<em>Badland Hunters</em>) also stars as Jung Jae-yi, the first daughter of a powerful chaebol. Directed by Bae Hyun-jin (also director for my beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23649168/alchemy-of-souls-best-netflix-fantasy-tv-show-series"><em>Alchemy of Souls: Light and Shadow</em></a>) and written by Chu Hye-mi (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4LjT9nX9fo&amp;ab_channel=Cereal"><em>About Time</em></a>), <em>Hierarchy</em> has the makings to be one of the biggest K-drama hits of the summer.</p>

<p id="dIhohJ"><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>The Bequeathed, The World of the Married</em></p>
<p id="3SwYgM">Originally known as <em>Alone in the Woods</em>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81654427"><em>The Frog</em></a> is a dark, psychological drama set in two time periods in the same rural area of South Korea. Kim Yoon-seok (<em>The Chaser, Another Child</em>) stars as Jeon Young-ha, a man who is running a motel in the year 2000. Yoon Kye-sang (K-pop boy band g.o.d., <em>Road Number One</em>) stars as Koo Sang-joon, a man who is running a pension in the same region in 2021. When both men are faced with the same scenario, two decades apart, they make different choices. <em>Sweet Home</em>’s Go Min-so will also star as Yoo Seong-ha.</p>
<p id="KZQmwe">The story will unfold over the course of eight episodes, and seems poised to play up the suspense. <em>The World of the Married</em> director Mo Wan II is behind the camera for this one. <em>The World of the Married</em> is one of the most successful cable K-dramas of all time, and also relies on effectively maintaining complex psychological tension across a series run. In other words, this is probably going to be scary in the best ways.</p>

<p id="U3YzNi"><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> TBA<br><strong>Recommended for fans of:</strong> <em>Parasyte: The Grey, Hellbound</em></p>
<p id="tvH75k">When <em>Sweet Home</em>, an adaptation of the webtoon of the same name, was released in December 2020, it became the first K-drama to make it into the Netflix Top Ten. This led to back-to-back filming of Season 2 and 3, and a noticeable increase in budget for this horror about a monster apocalypse and the humans, monsters, and hybrids fighting to survive within it. </p>
<p id="qyd5lr">Song Kang stars as Cha Hyun-su, a teen orphan who has lost the will to live when the apocalypse breaks out. As he evolves into something new, he finds new purpose in protecting the found family he makes at Green Home Apartments.</p>
<p id="oTjltl">Season 2 dropped in December 2023 and was not quite as popular as the first, early pandemic season, but with the ambitious story set to conclude in Season 3, more Song Kang (who is currently away performing mandatory military service), and the return of fan favorite Lee Do-hyun to the action, this conclusion has the opportunity to pull viewers back in. Let’s hope this beloved K-drama sticks the landing! </p>

Just not <em>this</em> much sooner.</p><p>The big question, of course hasn’t been whether, but rather how much? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561">Microsoft buying Activision</a></span> was one of the most controversial events in all of gaming history, and it’d be a pretty redundant effort if the Xbox maker weren’t then able to flaunt access to the multi-billion dollar franchise on its own machine, while charging full-price for PlayStation players.

Spiderling Studios has taken another technical leap forward by implementing new water-based systems that shake up what the mighty machines players have concocted are capable of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players can now lay siege to fortresses on land or sea not only with massive sailing ships, but also with submersibles firing from deep under water. Any developer who's had to program </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/water-interaction-model-for-boats-in-video-games">boat physics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can attest to how difficult designing such systems can be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a conversation with Game Developer, Spiderling Studios lead producer Toby Hawkins and publishing director Stefan Metaxa shared some details about producing such an ambitious expansion—revealing that to make the oceanic physics system the best it could be, they needed to retreat from the idea of Early Access and silently work on an expansion without input from players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Oceans are now battlefields">Oceans are now battlefields</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Hawkins and Metaxa, water physics had long been a requested feature from players during the 5-year Early Access development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But as mentioned before, that's a very, very expensive request.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s journey wrapping up in 2020, the team had time to evaluate how it could implement the feature, which was something they'd genuinely wanted to explore. "How can you pass up an opportunity like that?" Hawkins recalled when explaining the decision to implement underwater physics along with the surface-level system. They evaluated two options: returning to Early Access with a sequel, or submerging to the depths to quietly work on a downloadable expansion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expansion won out. Even though Spiderling Studios benefitted from a vibrant community of passionate players, they recognized Early Access could make developing these complex systems more difficult, and player feedback wouldn't solve problems faster.</span></p><p>Image via Spiderling Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't get the amount of feedback that you would get if you did Early Access, Hawkins said. "But at the same time, we can be a bit more creative and take risks with what we're doing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because water physics would touch every system of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, getting it wrong would impact the game on a "large scale." Working in a silo allowed Spiderling Studios to massively rewrite the system as it needed to without disrupting the player experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addressing this topic, he revealed a key fact for any developer making a simulation game in Early Access: players invested in these games are constantly making creations they become very attached to. That means the studio made it basic procedure during the base game's development to ensure player machines "always keep working" no matter what changes are introduced.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were other reasons to avoid another trip down Early Access lane. Since 2020, player expectations for the process have changed, and it's more important than ever to make sure players are getting their money's worth.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Access expectations have intensified">Early Access expectations have intensified</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spiderling Studios began its Early Access journey in a completely different era. In 2015 there weren't many high-profile examples of developers making the practice a business model, and studios risked being accused of selling "incomplete" games to get a quick buck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one of the games that showed the program's potential. Years later, developers like Supergiant Games and Larian have made it a massive popular feature, allowing even story-based single player games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to get in on the collaborative development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the stigma over releasing "incomplete games" hasn't gone away. If anything, Metaxa thinks it's intensified. "It's become clear that there is a level of expectation because of the stigma associated with Early Access that players expect something very high quality already. It's more difficult to get away with the idea of 'okay, we're just going to release something half-finished.'"</span></p><p>Image via Spiderling Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It has to be this very polished—maybe smaller scoped—version of the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not a bad thing, in his view. But it does mean Early Access launches are now practically as intense as 1.0 game launches. "You have to make sure that your Early Access is going to be as successful as possible early," he said, noting that many developers have had strong debuts—but couldn't carry the momentum forward for hitting 1.0.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was one other fun outcome of going dark for the DLC development period. During development, Metaxa said the team tossed around the question of "does everyone still care about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege?</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">" Making the DLC proved to be a test on whether players wanted more content, and maybe even if they'd want a sequel somewhere in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">People do in fact, still care about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Besiege</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Metaxa said it was "really amazing" for the development team to see the reaction of an audience who hadn't expected the DLC at all. "People were so hyped," he recalled.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like Early Access development, designing DLC can be an act of managing expectations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-for-september-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1795444496399786102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Nintendo announced a new 2-in-1 LEGO set based on The Legend of Zelda, featuring the Great Deku Tree. </p>



<p>The previously rumored set will be available on September 1, 2024. Nintendo also revealed a brief teaser of the set, revealing the design and figures included. </p>



<p>The teaser does not confirm the exact pricing for the set. However, it is listed at $299.99 on LEGO’s official <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product page</a>, where fans can pre-order now.</p>



<p>The teaser also showcases the packaging, which confirms the set is intended for older fans of ages 18 and up. The box also reveals this set will include 2500 pieces. This is fairly large compared to similar video game-themed sets, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-getting-four-new-lego-sets-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play-friendly Sonic sets</a> or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-animal-crossing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing LEGO sets</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>LEGO has consistently been able to successfully appeal to video game fans, thanks to a variety of original games and crossovers. </p>



<p>Most recently, reports surfaced of a collaboration between LEGO and PlayStation for a game called “LEGO Horizon Adventures.” Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently reported</a> that the game would be “Horizon Forbidden West but Lego.”</p>



<p>Besides the remarkable new LEGO set, Legend of Zelda fans are also looking forward to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the movie adaptation</a>. There have been various updates on the film since it was announced in November 2023. </p>



<p>The most recent Legend of Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom, sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million copies in just 3 days</a> after it launched in 2023.</p>

See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="fbq1fP">In 2018, when director Pablo Berger was thinking about his next movie, he happened to crack open one of his favorite graphic novels, a short, wordless story about a dog and a robot, best friends who are separated and drift apart. Berger had read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robot-Dreams-Sara-Varon/dp/1250073502?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Robot-Dreams-Sara-Varon/dp/1250073502?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23927611__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23927611__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Sara Varon’s <em>Robot Dreams</em></a> before, but the reread caught him off guard. </p>
<p id="Tv73ol">“This time, when I got to the end of the book, that last act, I was so moved by the story, it brought me truly to tears,” Berger told Polygon in an interview ahead of the film’s limited theatrical release. “I was so shaken by the story. Right there at that moment, I thought there was something very special about the book. That’s when I decided to adapt it and make an animated film — even if it was something new for me.”</p>
<p id="x6aZwS">Varon’s book is a surprisingly poignant look at the ephemeral nature of friendships, and Berger was determined to capture that in his movie. He’d written and directed three celebrated, successful live-action feature films — <em>Torremolinos 73</em>, <em>Abracadabra</em>, and Spain’s 2012 Academy Award submission, <em>Blancanieves</em>. But making an animated movie would be different. Very different. </p>
<p id="akdf6n">“I was truly very frightened about starting the production,” he says. “But I like challenges. It didn’t block me. It really excited me, the fact that it was something new.”</p>

<p id="SaW6xK">But despite his lack of experience, Berger’s <em>Robot Dreams</em> captures the book’s surprising poignancy, while using the extra space of a feature-length film to expand on its central relationships. It’s set in 1980s New York City, in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals. When one of them, Dog, feels lonely and isolated, he orders a robot companion. And after a whirlwind summer together, bonding over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfi9JpgMc2U">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire’s “September,”</a> they become best friends. </p>
<p id="gJeJ0X">But an outing to Coney Island leaves Robot powered down and stranded on the beach, and when Dog returns to rescue him, he finds the beach closed for the rest of the year. The remainder of the movie follows what happens to the two of them in their time apart, and how they forge new connections while never forgetting each other. It’s a lovely reverie on friendship, and the space we hold in our hearts for those we left behind (in this case, pretty physically and literally). </p>
<p id="eXZBtS">Following a limited release, <em>Robot Dreams</em> was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, alongside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23759647/nimona-netflix-comic-changes-nd-stevenson"><em>Nimona</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review"><em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a>. The movie finally debuts in American theaters this summer, starting with a small release in New York City on May 31. Berger is excited to see his movie gain more traction after its surprise Oscar appearance, especially since it’s a story he is so passionate about. That passion was what fueled the production, despite the challenges for a first-time animation director. And there were some big challenges. Originally, Berger was set to work with Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/15/21438560/wolfwalkers-review-apple-tv-plus"><em>Wolfwalkers</em></a>, <em>The Secret of Kells</em>) for<em> Robot Dreams</em>. But production hit a snag during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Berger had to pivot. </p>
<p id="VWGo6C">“Suddenly, we had to create our own studios in Spain,” he says. “So we called them pop-up studios, because we had to create them from scratch. We had to find the offices, buy the computers, hire animators and artists from all over Europe, and create a pipeline. So that was really hard.”</p>

<p id="PmfR95">Berger quickly learned some key differences between production on a live-action movie and an animated one. For one, there are no individual department heads for hair and makeup or camera on an animated movie; it all falls under the art department. And there are no actors in a movie without dialogue; the animators handle all the “acting.”</p>
<p id="oMqAUC">“At the same time, I had to achieve the same goal,” says Berger. “Three-dimensional, emotional, believable performances.” </p>
<p id="MEIp5T">Berger tells us that in his live-action work, he talks with actors and looks deep in their eyes in order to draw out the most emotionally truthful performance he can. And with <em>Robot Dreams</em>, he wanted to take the same approach — just a little bit adjusted, of course, since there were no actors to make that connection with. </p>
<p id="39wYvq">“When I was looking at the animation of the drawings, I looked at the pupils of the characters,” he explains. “So basically, to bring a truthful, believable performance that could move the audience, that the audience could have empathy for Dog and Robot.”</p>

<p id="95QKXB">Berger says he enjoyed every minute working on <em>Robot Dreams</em>, and he would happily do another animated film in the future. There’s a lingering prejudice, especially in the United States, against animation, seen primarily as a medium for children’s movies. But Berger, like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511107/guillermo-del-toro-pinocchio-interview-netflix-monsters">Guillermo del Toro</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2020/7/2/21311449/clone-high-revival-new-episodes-lord-miller-mtv-lawrence-season-2-gandhi">Phil Lord and Christopher Miller</a> before him, is a firm believer that animation isn’t a genre. </p>
<p id="DINWCB">“Animation is just a way to tell the story. And animation is not only for kids. There are so many great animated films that could be for kids, but could be for adults,” he says, citing the likes of <em>Persepolis</em>, <em>The Triplets of Belleville</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/21267907/studio-ghibli-movies-watch-guide-totoro-spirited-away-miyazaki-takahata-films">Studio Ghibli’s filmography</a>. While <em>Robot Dreams </em>is family-friendly, Berger says his studio never made any compromises in the filmmaking process in order to appeal to children. In fact, aiming at a specific audience was the last thing on his mind. </p>
<p id="tSedp4">“I like to make an analogy with film. Films, for me, they are like a lasagna. And there are different layers. Every audience gets a different layer,” he says. “In a way, it looks back to when I was a kid and I saw the same film as my parents. Some of the films that are released in the last decades seem that they’re catered for [just] cinephiles, or for commercial [audiences], or for children. I think [<em>Robot Dreams</em>] really is for a very wide audience.” </p>
<p id="z5W2Pj"><small><em>Robot Dreams </em></small><small>opens in New York City on May 31, and will eventually roll out into theaters nationwide.</small></p>

<p>In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29/?sf273351644=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a> today, Sony announced that PlayStation’s Days of Play 2024 is coming on May 29, featuring new discounts and activities. </p>

<p>PlayStation players will get access to new, celebratory avatars throughout Days of Play. Sony also announced the PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup for June, and bonus titles for the Game Catalog and more.</p>



<p>Some highlights include Star Wars: The Clone Wars for PS2, and Dredge for PS4 and PS5 on day one of the event. Later, the definitive edition of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is coming on June 7.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of the Days of Play activities will include a community challenge, new Stars campaigns, and an Esports tournament.</p>

<p>Sony will offer $50 off a PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition. Additionally, there will be $100 off PlayStation VR2.

<p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 first launched in March 2024 to strong critical reviews. However, it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragons-dogma-2-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced early backlash</a> over microtransaction concerns, and Capcom’s approach surrounding them. Some fans also noted performance issues, among other flaws.</p>



<p>Still, data showed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragons-dogma-2-was-march-2024s-best-selling-game-in-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game of March 2024</a> in the US. </p>



<p>In fact, the combined revenue boost from Dragon’s Dogma 2 and the latest Street Fighter ultimately encouraged Capcom to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-raises-earnings-forecast-following-dragons-dogma-2-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise its earnings forecast</a>. </p>



<p>As a result, Capcom’s revised forecast for the year ending March 31st, 2024, increased from 40 to 43.3 million yen in net income. </p>



<p>So, despite some early criticism toward Dragon’s Dogma 2, it seems the game will continue to perform well. The series first began in May 2012, so it celebrated another major anniversary last week. The devs also took that opportunity <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1793932038778814900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to thank players</a> on Twitter. </p>



<p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

As revealed by a TikTok clip posted by Royza Gaming, below, the announcement of the R6 Membership specifically was booed by fans during the BLAST R6 Major Manchester 2024 event for Rainbow Six Siege that took place over the weekend.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@royzagaming/video/7373343581811133704" data-video-id="7373343581811133704"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royzagaming?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@royzagaming" rel="noopener noreferrer">@royzagaming</a> New siege membership <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6?refer=embed" title="r6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6siege?refer=embed" title="r6siege" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6siege</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/r6update?refer=embed" title="r6update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#r6update</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/royzagaming?refer=embed" title="royzagaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#royzagaming</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7373343772052048657?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Royza" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Royza</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d151ny/live_reaction_to_r6_membership/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a> posted by redditor I-Am-Bodge also showed the booing at the R6 Membership announcement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1d24h0d/comment/l603gm8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to  I-Am-Bodge</a>, when a prerecorded video announced the R6 Membership, some in the audience chanted “greedy bastards.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Siege isn’t the first live service to offer a premium membership, but it compares poorly to those from other games in terms of value. The R6 Membership is even being compared unfavorably to the Fortnite Crew subscription, which is for a free-to-download game. "Although yeah you can simply ignore it (and I'm aware this system isn't tailored for people like me for example), that doesn't take away to how shitty is both the intention of making a subscription at the life-point of this game and overall how bad of a deal it is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d14f55/comment/l5rkrhn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Jesus_PK commented.</a></p><p>There are now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1d1ky4a/lets_boycott_membership_system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calls to boycott the R6 Membership</a>, although such calls have been met with scepticism by many within the community. As Rainbow Six Siege nears its 10th year on sale, Ubisoft is under pressure to continue to grow money made from the game, just as other publishers are with their own live services. But it will also be mindful of community sentiment, and the strength of feeling from some core players about how the game is monetized now and in the future.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Director Swen Vincke emphasised the team "didn't overly crunch," and staff were paid overtime</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke touched upon crunch at Digital Dragons last week, saying that while Larian's team didn't "overly crunch" during development, you "always have a little bit" of overtime when trying to finish a project of that scope.</p>
<p>Vincke made these comments during a Q&amp;A at the Polish conference, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GamesRadar</a>. Answering a question about whether challenges encountered during Baldur's Gate 3's development resulted in crunch, Larian's CEO said:</p>
<p>"Certainly less on BG3 than we did in the past. It would be a lie to say that we didn't. We had things happen that we didn't foresee."</p>
<p>He mentioned Larian's structure, with its global offices relaying with each other when working on a project, often avoiding overtime falling on any one office.</p>
<p>But when overtime did occur, staff was paid for it (which isn't necessarily a standard in games), with offices mostly empty by 8pm and occupied "very, very, very rarely" on weekends. He added that the overtime wasn't "as long as you would consider crunch."</p>
<p>He said: "We didn't overly crunch, but we did have to do a bit of crunch. And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p>
<p>Larian announced the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-to-expand-with-warsaw-office">opening of its seventh office in Warsaw, Poland just last week</a>.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-after-baldurs-gate-3-we-have-ambitions-to-make-really-good-rpgs-and-thats-sufficient">talked to Vincke earlier this year about life post-Baldur's Gate 3</a>, why the team is moving on, and solving the industry's unsustainable growth.</p>
