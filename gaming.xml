            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I screwed up real bad in my first few in-game days of the latest Steam hit, <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint.</em> I let an infected person into the safe zone of our military-run camp. They turned into a zombie overnight, and I woke up to dead survivors. The reason I let them in? Right now, the last thing I want to do is hand off random citizens to soldiers in masks who will take them away to get “liquidated.”</p> <p>Before you email me or screenshot this article and share it online, let me be very clear: <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">I know I’m breaking the rules</a>. I know I’m not supposed to talk about the real world when writing about video games. That’s a big no-no. To dare connect the dots between a digital game and the real world we all live in is often seen by some of the loudest online as a cardinal sin. Unforgivable. Well, get over it because I find it genuinely impossible to write about<em> Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> without addressing the current state of America.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">In <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint,</em></a> out now on PC, you play as a commander who has just arrived at a hastily put-together military installation in the middle of New York City. Your job is to help make all the big decisions on this base, including managing resources, upgrades, and the health and safety of personnel. But most of my time in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> was spent manning a single entry point at the front of the base, where survivors crawl out of a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested city in the hopes of finding shelter, food, and medicine. But first, they have to get past me, the asshole with a flashlight and gloves who decides who lives and dies.</p>

 <p>The majority of<em> Last Checkpoint</em> revolves around operating that point of entry. Early on, you are equipped with a flashlight and a small list of various symptoms and injuries to look out for, like bites and bloodshot eyes, and must use that list to determine who is healthy enough to enter, who needs to hang out in a quarantine cell for a few days, and who might need to be taken over to a non-descript room just out of eyesight of everyone to be shot in the head. As the in-game days go on, you start getting new tools, like a rubber mallet to check reflexes, and an X-ray gun to scan for hidden bites.</p>

 <p>In my first few days, I avoided sending anyone to the kill room. I’ve spent the past few months watching President Trump’s jackbooted thugs in masks, aka ICE, grab people off the street, sometimes at gunpoint, and take them away to places none of us can see. Not everyone comes back. And as I played <em>Last Checkpoint,</em> my phone was filled with photos and videos from out of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv7knz8e8mo">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2000-federal-agents-sent-to-minneapolis-area-to-carry-out-largest-immigration-operation-ever-ice-says">where ICE continues to cause mayhem and destruction</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/09/nx-s1-5672502/minneapolis-portland-ice-shootings">even shooting an innocent woman in the face in broad daylight</a>. So the armed guards decked out in full masks and carrying large assault rifles in<em>&nbsp;Last Checkpoint</em> were hard to trust.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659009"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659009">©Brigada Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But eventually, as space in quarantine ran out and I sent a few too many infected people into the safe zone and got others killed, I had to start sending people away to get shot in a room for the good of everyone else. There is no cure for the zombie plague in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em>, so once you think someone is infected, there’s not much of an option left. Each time I’d send a survivor away, I’d wait for the message to pop up on the screen confirming whether they were infected or not. When I finally screwed up and realized I’d sent an innocent man to his death at the hands of gun-toting soldiers, I wasn’t sure if I was having fun anymore.</p>

 <p>Tracking symptoms and managing a small military base in the middle of a zombie apocalypse using various tools and having to make hard calls is a very tense experience. And when I could disconnect what was happening in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> from the world I currently live in, I found myself having a good time succeeding at helping people, something the game also rewards you for and makes clear is the main goal of all this. But then I’d check my phone and see what <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-immigration-enforcement-children-tear-gas-border-patrol-rcna241629">government-controlled soldiers are actually doing at a time when we aren’t being eaten alive by zombies</a>. The in-game soldiers and officials in <em>Last Checkpoint</em> have more restraint and empathy during a zombie apocalypse than the authorities walking our actual streets do right now. Wild shit.</p>

                <p>It's no secret that a video game based on 2008's The Dark Knight was in development at one point, before the plug was ultimately pulled. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-footage-for-batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-surfaces-online/1100-6522392/">Footage of the game</a>--which was being developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">by the now-shuttered Monolith Productions</a>--has surfaced online over the years, and this week, a new video showed how this Batman adventure would have taken a cue from the live-action films with its dynamic soundtrack.</p><p>As part of a treasure trove of materials uncovered by retro games enthusiast and archivist Mar Talida, the footage showcases early cinematic footage, game design documents, concept art, and much more. If you have an ear for video game soundtracks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbadrp5ek2v" rel="nofollow ">there's even video of the game's dynamic audio system</a> and how it would change depending on the situation that players found themselves in. Batman live-action films have had iconic soundtracks, and Monolith's game used some of Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight soundtrack to demonstrate this feature.</p><p>It's worth noting that all of this content came from very early in the pre-production of the Batman game--codenamed Project Apollo--as the assets were dated to around 2009-2010 and naturally look rougher than the 2024 leak.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcba4da5xk2x" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiexnglfrkoagem3zaekq35capabq2ux3cwacqlek5gdc2hwzn35la" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>I've recovered a cache of documents and videos from the pre-production phase of Project Apollo, a canceled Batman game Monolith worked on for Warner Bros.

  </div><p>While the project was eventually scrapped and elements of it were used to develop Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its signature Nemesis System, Batman fans weren't left out in the cold thanks to Rocksteady's popular Arkham series of games. Since then, things have changed drastically at publisher Warner Bros. Games, as it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-game-publisher-undergoes-major-shakeup/1100-6532546/">weathered major organizational </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-game-publisher-undergoes-major-shakeup/1100-6532546/">shifts</a> and could soon have a new owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-bid-for-warner-bros-now-looks-more-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6537239/" data-ref-id="1100-6537239">in the form of Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paramount-not-giving-up-on-buying-warner-bros-launches-lawsuit/1100-6537335/" data-ref-id="1100-6537335">Paramount</a>. Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>, and DC studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a> in the future.</p><p>Fortunately, Batman returns later this year in Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The new Lego game looks like it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-isnt-just-another-lego-game/1100-6534151/">taking a few pages out of the Arkham playbook</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-releases-in-may/1100-6536781/">and it'll be released on May 29</a> for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date.</p>

While the company still hasn't released pricing info for the SteamOS-based hardware, it has shed some light on its verification process in a new interview with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang, developers hoping for a "Steam Machine Verified" badge can expect "fewer constraints" than Steam Deck Verification. "One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine," Yang continued. VR developers seeking Steam Frame verification may expect a different process, though Yang said Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" as it does for the other verification programs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "Steam Deck Verified" badge has proven to be more than a mere quality assessor when releasing games on Steam. It's also been a major marketing beat for developers—one so potent companies like Microsoft-owned Bethesda are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/quake-is-now-steam-deck-verified-223009852.html">publicizing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Steam Deck Verified status for classic games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Quake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A "Verified" badge also means your game might appear on the "Great on Deck" section of the Steam Store, the default store page found when accessing the marketplace on the device.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-steam-awards-2025-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hollow Knight: Silksong is the Steam Awards' 2025 Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve didn't provide additional technical requirements for earning the "Steam Machine Verified" status—though it did offer some details on why it created the Steam Controller Puck pairing system that reflects its hardware philosophy.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Valve's goal: &quot;It just works&quot;">Valve's goal: "It just works"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's Steam Controller Puck, the device that can both charge and pair a Steam Controller to any PC it's plugged into, was a small surprise in the Steam Machine hardware reveal. Most controller manufacturers have settled on using Bluetooth or USB-C as their main means of pairing controllers. Valve says it created this extra piece of hardware to address issues not with Bluetooth itself, but the environments people play in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While Bluetooth is a great wireless connection method, we found in our testing that people’s home wireless environments and PC Bluetooth capabilities are highly variable (clogged networks, wireless interference, increased latency when using multiple BT devices, etc.)," said engineer Steve Cardinali.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cardinali added that the Puck "addresses these issues."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Another problem we set out to solve was the fact that dedicated wireless receivers that are plugged directly into the back of a PC near other USB ports can create interference issues.

            <p>Who mods the mods? A bunch of people, or so was the hope of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON when they released their total conversion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> back in 2024. So far, there've been plenty of tweaks and smaller scale additions to the mod's version of the post-apocalyptic English capital, but no new quests or world expansions of note.</p>
<p>Things playing out that way to this point - despite Team FOLON having <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-british-fallout-making-of-interview">been very open in encouraging other modders</a> to have a go at making such creations - is something Fallout: London project lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter's clearly aware of, and he's offered a few theories as to why it might be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are definitely some cut quests which are not planned in any of the DLCs that could have been implemented, which we have voiced, but that just wasn’t in the scope of what we could do before we moved on as a company," Carter told <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/industry/fallout-london-creator-bethesda-elder-scrolls-vi-fallout-5-gta-london/">Esports.net</a> in a fresh interview. "If a modder wants to get involved in them, they absolutely can. That’s what we’d love to see. We’re modders at the end of the day. We’re never going to say no to other modders wanting to do stuff."</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that, while his team have chatted with "quite a lot of smaller modders", there hasn't been a deluge of folks wanting to flesh out the massive mod with their own extra quests or adventures, as is the case with all of the pro studio-made modern Fallouts. Instead, a glance at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4london">Fallout: London's Nexus Mods page</a> - which I've kept an eye on regularly to see if these sorts of ambitious or creative works pop up - currently turns up just over 600 mods that generally provide handy tweaks to mechanics or fairly compact additions like player homes. There are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/17">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/613">few</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/461">mods</a> by a creator called WitherAwayyy I've dug up which could fit the expansion bill, but they remain exceptions to the rule.</p><p>"I’ve heard of people who have been looking into it, and we give advice and help if they ask, but I don’t know of any new worlds or spaces coming up," Carter admitted in this chat. That's no huge issue - Fallout: London's plenty good played in its 'vanilla' state, as Carter reckons a lot of potential modders may simply prefer. That said, it's still an intriguing thing to see play out, given I can't think many other mods off the top of my head which have offered such an expansive opportunity for modding on top of modding.</p>
<p>Though, at this juncture Carter reckons that may well have been another of the limiting factors the mod's modding scene has bumped up against. "I think people are also well aware that, given the nature of how large we built an entire game on top of another game, it’s not the easiest to mod, and there are stability issues that come from building a game on top of a game," he said. The modder also reckons Fallout 4's age has played a role. "It’s a modding scene for a decade-old game. I think a lot of people have moved on," he theorised. "Even ourselves, when you go back to that question of would we do more, the answer is probably not in Fallout 4."</p>
<p>While this may be one area in which Fallout: London simply can't mirror the Fallout entry to which some have compared what the sort of detour it offers Fallout players - Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> - there are still a couple of bits of free Team FOLON-made DLC yet to arrive for it. Last Orders is the first of these and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-next-dlc-last-orders-will-be-served-up-early-this-year-if-current-pint-pulling-plans-hold">should arrive pretty soon</a>, followed at some point down the line by a Yes Man-esque questline in the Wildcard DLC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-at-nearly-60-off-comes-with-windows-11-pro-and-microsoft-office-priced-like-a-budget-tablet-2000659048</link>
            <guid>1404415</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If high laptop prices have been holding you back from upgrading, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">The 15.6-inch HP business laptop is down to $400 at Amazon, after a massive 56% or $500 discount on its usual $900 price.</a></p>
<p>The bundle includes a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, and a recovery USB. Delivery is free, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the overall cost down even further. But as you’d expect, the discount is around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last longer than a day, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expandable Memory and Storage</h2>
<p>For just $400, you’re getting a sleek laptop that features a nice 15.6-inch Full HD display. With a resolution of 1920 × 1080, the screen delivers crisp details and vibrant colors for an immersive viewing experience. The anti-glare coating keeps it easy on the eyes, allowing you to use the laptop comfortably in all lighting conditions. Working on an important work presentation or just catching up on your favorite show, expect vivid, sharp visuals consistently.</p>
<p>The machine is powered by the latest Intel Core i3-1315U processor that features 6 cores (2 performance cores + 4 efficiency cores) and 8 threads to deliver fast, efficient performance. Intel Turbo Boost Technology helps it reach up to 4.5 GHz, meaning you can rely on the laptop for everyday work tasks, plus casual use (browsing, streaming, checking emails, communicating). Paired with the laptop is a modest 8GB RAM, which keeps everything running smoothly at the backend. It’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask, but here’s the good part – the memory is expandable up to 64GB. That means you can always upgrade as your needs grow. The same is the case with the 628GB SSD (128GB SSD+500GB external). It’s sufficient to house important files, work documents, and media content, but the PCIe NVMe SSD supports capacities up to 2 TB. If it ever feels tight, you expand the capacity to keep the system running smoothly.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re covered with Ethernet (RJ-45) for speedy wired networking, an SD card reader, USB-C, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI output, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. That’s more than enough to create a productive setup for both office and studies. You can add external drives, and even connect another monitor if you need more than one screen.</p>
<p>Freebies add even more value to the bundle. You’re getting a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, which offers access to efficient apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and more. You will also enjoy 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, handy AI features, and other useful tools that make remote productivity and creativity a breeze. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the laptop right away. And finally, there’s a WOWPC recovery USB in the bundle, which offers quick and convenient system restoration in case of software issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">This future-proof HP laptop is now sitting at just $400 at Amazon.</a> It’s practically nothing considering all the features the machine is packed with. We highly suggest grabbing it as soon as you can before the price shoots back up to $900.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Division Might Be Getting Exactly What Destiny Fans Have Long Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970</link>
            <guid>1404412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tom-clancys-the-division-the-kotaku-review-1766431754"><em>The Division</em></a> came out nearly a decade ago. You can still go and play it but it hasn’t received a meaningful update since 2018. That could all be about to change. Marketing for “<em>The Division: Definitive Edition</em>” recently appeared in Japan suggesting the Tom Clancy-branded loot shooter could be getting a modern version to bring players back into its snowy, post-apocalyptic New York City.</p> <p>A mural advertising the unannounced version was spotted at the <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010224815131766796%7Ctwgr%5E03918b0436fb66d4f458378427f25deceae49e55%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fit-looks-like-the-division-definitive-edition-is-on-the-way-10-years-after-its-initial-release">FPS Day X esports event</a> where Ubisoft shared other info about the franchise, like a new “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zo5k8xkeHs">Realism Mode</a>” for <em>The Division 2</em> that will make the RPG play more like a traditional shooter with quicker time-to-kills and other more lethal tweaks. The first <em>Division</em> game originally launched back in March 2016, so it’s likely that whatever this Definitive Edition is could become available in just a few months.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FPSDayX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FPSDayX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheDivision2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%93%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B32?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ディビジョン2</a> <a href="https://t.co/1ySkfSb98B">pic.twitter.com/1ySkfSb98B</a></p> <p>— Domen🐻Gaming | ドウメン (@domen0204) <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>What a Definitive Edition would actually entail has been the subject of much speculation over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1q9ywr5/the_division_definitive_edition_spotted_at_fpsday/"><em>The Division</em> subreddit</a>. Will it be a current-gen remaster that brings the game natively to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S? <em>The Division 2</em> never got one, making that theory seem unlikely to some. Others would be happy if the game simply got support for 60fps on console and other quality-of-life improvements. Some fans have also suggested the possibility of new story content, or the merging of certain mechanics and modes from the current game back into the older one.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s very possible that what Ubisoft might mean by a “Definitive Edition” is that it’s bringing all of <em>The Division 1</em> and <em>The Division 2</em> into a single cohesive package. That would seemingly be a much bigger undertaking and it’s hard to see exactly how it would work. The second game’s Warlords of New York added the first game’s location, but there’s still a ton of missions, story, and other content that could make its way there. A single package would also make it a more obvious candidate for a Switch 2 port.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> seems to be doing exactly what <em>Destiny</em> fans keep begging for</h2> <p>Assuming that whatever this Definitive Edition is, it brings the old game forward for new and returning players to enjoy fresh in 2026 in some way, developer Massive will be fulfilling the dream that many <em>Destiny</em> fans have had ever since <em>Destiny 2</em> wrapped up its big, 10-year story arc with <em>The Final Shape</em>. While Bungie has brought some of the best parts of the old game forward into <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, it also ditched most of the sequel’s original campaign to make room for ongoing expansions.</p>

 <p>A perennial request of fans is for the Red War and other cut content to return. Another pie-in-the-sky wish is for the old <em>Destiny</em> to return in some “vanilla” form similar to<em> World of Warcraft Classic.</em> It would be the original game but with a visual overhaul and on modern platforms so that players feel like there’s a reason for everyone to go back at the same time. The third request you’ll find in the replies for almost any new announcement from the <em>Destiny</em> social media account is for Bungie to simply start fresh and make <em>Destiny 3</em>.</p>

 <p>https://x.com/blueberriesGG/status/2010713900975902762</p> <p>Those are all very tall orders for a studio that’s suffered tons of layoffs, cuts, and player attrition in recent years, especially as it works on getting its new sci-fi shooter, <em>Marathon</em>, out the door alongside ongoing <em>Destiny 2</em> updates. But this is kind of what fans of <em>The Division</em> are in for right now. Executive producer Julian Gerighty recently teased that <em>The Division 3</em> is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489">shaping up to be a monster</a>.” In addition to its recently revealed Realism Mode, The <em>Division 2</em> is also getting its delayed Survivors mode later this year.</p>

 <p>If this Definitive Edition of the original game doesn’t disappoint, fans of the apocalyptic shooter will be eating well. <em>Destiny 2</em> fans might even be envious. Something they’ve never had much reason to feel before, if ever.</p>

<p>A whole cache of documents and footage from the cancelled Monolith Batman game has surfaced online, showcasing audio systems, character art, game mechanics, vehicles, and more. </p>



<p>Footage and other details about cancelled Batman games have been surfacing online for quite some time now. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-concept-art-cancelled-batman-game-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concept art</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potential-footage-for-canceled-damian-wayne-batman-game-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">potential footage</a> from the cancelled Damian Batman game by WB Games Montreal. Now, much more footage has been released for Monolith’s title, along with additional details.</p>











<p>The cache of footage and documents for the cancelled Monolith Batman game comes through a series of posts by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrTalida on BlueSky</a>. The bulk of the footage was part of “internal-facing and Warner Bros.-facing pre-production milestone deliverables”; however, some files are from an actual build. </p>



<p>The first set of videos discusses the dynamic audio system from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, showcasing how the music reacts and transitions as the player moves in and out of stealth, enters combat, and plays quests. </p>







<p>Then we get to see an example of cloth physics, showcasing how Batman’s cape moves around while walking. We also get to see character art for Gordon and members of the Gotham police, along with a facial animation test. </p>







<p>We were also shown other game mechanics from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, including the caped crusader throwing Batarangs to knock enemies down, using smoke bombs to enter stealth, knocking enemies down, using detective mode to collect evidence, and more. </p>







<p>The last video shows the Tumbler Batmobile in action, maneuvering through various sets of obstacles, using its boosts, and ramming into other elements on the map. Readers should note that this is very early footage, from 2009 to 2010. More files and documents are available <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>

Both have been widely praised for their visuals and story, though have also caught flak for prioritizing cinematography over gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new, third Hellblade title in development at Ninja Theory will respond to that criticism by focusing on being more of a "game," according to Windows Central editor Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KPhoHILH4Wo?t=2176s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Two</a> podcast. At the same time, Corden said that Ninja Theory was no longer working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-mara">Project Mara</a>, an "experimental title" announced by Microsoft back in 2020.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From what I understand, the next game [from Ninja Theory] is Hellblade 3," Corden said. "And it's going to be a bit more interactive than Hellblade 1 and 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't know what the exact nature of Hellblade 3 is going to be like," he continued, "if it's even going to be Hellblade 3, but it does sound like it's going to be in the Hellblade universe, and it does sound like they want to make it more of a 'game', y'know, and broaden the appeal to some degree."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Mara was announced as one of several titles being worked on at Ninja Theory back in 2020, alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>, and a separate R&amp;D project described as "an ambitious combination of technology, game design and clinical neuroscience." The years since have revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-and-hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-built-an-ai-called-muse-designed-to-generate-ideas-for-a-games-design-and-its-already-making-complex-gameplay-sequences">the studio has been working with Microsoft's generative AI model Muse as part of a project that's generate clips of simulated gameplay</a>.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"You guys shouldn't expect Project Mara to be a thing," Corden claimed. "Project Mara was just a concept, it's not a game — and it's not a game they're currently working on. It might be something they work on eventually, but Project Mara is not a game that's currently being worked on at Ninja Theory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Corden has since doubled down via <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2010993531037302935" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> on his claim that Project Mara was "only ever a concept" rather than a full game — so therefore "the game wasn't cancelled." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2020, Ninja Theory <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> Project Mara as "our new in-development experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." To date, there's been no further word on what became of the concept or why it was seemingly been abandoned. Last year, it was publicly confirmed that Team Ninja's colourful co-founder Tameem Antoniades had quietly left the studio, something that Microsoft only acknowledged to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> after his absence was noted on a press visit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Microsoft for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French publisher Ubisoft is promising a nostalgic 2026, with remakes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> nearing completion, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">the first Division game also getting a re-release</a> of sorts. For many of the developers at key studios, however, the year is off to an awful start.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft's Halifax Studio was promptly shuttered</a> only weeks after unionising. The true motives behind the closure were unclear, but we had reasons to question Ubisoft's short comments on the matter, especially after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">everything going on at Rockstar Games</a>. Some voices online pointed out the developers were maybe seeing a closure coming, and thus prepared to face it with better protections. Today, that theory seems stronger, as Ubisoft continued to take "additional steps" <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-offer-voluntary-redundancies-to-massive-entertainment-staff">following the "voluntary career transition program" offered last year</a> to Massive Entertainment staffers.</p>
<p>The new layoffs, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, have (at the time of writing) translated into 55 roles being cut across the Massive Entertainment and Stockholm teams. Massive's plans for the immediate future haven't changed; the studio will continue to work on the new content coming to The Division 2 this year, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the seemingly massive threequel</a> (and probably that "definitive edition" of the first game).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora received a stunning third expansion DLC</a>, probably marking the end of substantial support for that game. Last year also saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-pc-graphics-comparison">Star Wars Outlaws being (excellently) ported to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. With those games "out of the way" now, one can see, without downplaying the horrible human cost, why and how Ubisoft is streamlining operations at Massive as it faces uncertainty in spite of the big reorganisation around its core franchises through a subsidiary <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/es-es/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios">announced in October 2025</a>.</p><p>Before the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-announces-restructuring-proposal-for-redlynx-60-jobs-may-be-at-risk">RedLynx also faced aggressive restructuring</a>, so this awful news is just a continuation of a company-wide trend that might continue well into 2026. Outside the aforementioned remakes and re-releases, Ubisoft's next 12 months are looking a bit too quiet, so there could be a lot riding on those blasts from the past.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘How Do You Beat That?’: Why The Elder Scrolls VI Is In a “No-Win” Situation]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/</link>
            <guid>1404385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although very little is known about <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a></em></strong> other than that it is in the works and it is coming out at some point, the community is obviously excited about the next entry in the series. However, as it's already been almost 15 years since the launch of the celebrated <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, expectations are incredibly high, so much so that they have put the game in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, according to a former Bethesda employee.</p>



<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview">Esports Insider</a></strong>, former <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Lead Artist&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile</strong>,&nbsp;who worked on&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;76,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skyrim</em>, commented on the next entry in the series and the challenges it is already facing during development. Expectations for both the game and Fallout 5 (which is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/">unlikely to return to the series' roots</a></strong>, according to Fallout New Vegas lead developer Chris Avellone) are very high, and Purkeypile believes they have put both games in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, alongside Skyrim being widely considered as one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p><em>"How do you beat that?"</em> he said. <em>"And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone,"</em> <strong>Purkeypile</strong> continued.</p>



<p>The massive fan expectations are putting major pressure on <strong><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong>, and, according to <strong>Purkeypile</strong>, <strong>Bethesda</strong> will take all the time needed to deliver the best possible game. <em>"I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls VI out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that,"</em> the former <strong>Bethesda</strong> lead artist elaborated.</p>



<p>The long time it's taking for the game to launch, however, has nothing to do with waiting to see <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em>'s</strong> reception. <em>"I’m sure there’s plenty of audience overlap and all, but just because one game flops doesn’t mean another will necessarily. There can be a whole bunch of reasons that happen."</em></p>



<p>Although a slightly different game, there's no denying that the reception <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> received when it launched in 2023</strong></a>, which hasn't really improved over time with the release of free updates and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a></strong>, could definitely be putting more pressure on the development team to deliver the best possible RPG, and the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"ultimate fantasy simulator"</strong></a></em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard</strong> himself teased last year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987</link>
            <guid>1404373</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>It wasn’t April Fool’s Day when Nintendo announced a big, new update for </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>—but mid-20s programmer Lemmy still thought it was a joke. His girlfriend sent him a link on Instagram, and he thought it was a fake announcement. He went straight to the source: Nintendo, where he realized that yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>Nintendo </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> releasing a new update for the five-year-old game</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s 3.0 update and Switch 2 upgrade for </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>will be released on January 15, the first big update to the game since 2021. </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> is far from a dead game, but its massive playerbase—which swelled during the COVID-19 pandemic—has, naturally, fell off. Those of us who spent hundreds of hours on our </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> islands for a year and a half have moved on; many of us haven’t visited our islands since. We’ve left messes on our islands, and remain forever indebted to Tom Nook. With the economy inevitably stalling after we took our “go get ‘em!” industriousness with us, the villagers we left behind have spent the last couple of years fending for themselves.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[My girlfriend and I] played </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> when it released and then I pretty much played it every day for a year, and maybe a little less often for another six months,” Lemmy said. “I think I fully stopped playing it summer 2023.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The new content and quality-of-life improvements it introduces make Nintendo’s 3.0 update the push many players needed to return to the game. But that raises a big question: To nuke or not to nuke? For some players, like Lemmy, the </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update was the perfect excuse not only to return to the game, but also to make a fresh start. “When I saw and heard about the update it persuaded me to restart,” he said. “I did that just before the new year.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659292">Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Morri Koester, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8BqWN05p7W_TOoFB7d9oA">a YouTube creator</a> who has played</span><i><span>&nbsp;New Horizons</span></i><span> for more than 5,000 hours and built a dozen or so islands, told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that they aren’t making a new island, but are still using the new update “as an excuse to do things differently”—”new year, new me sort of vibes,” they said. Koester has been working on their current island for two years at this point, and unlocked nearly all of the DIYs and catalogue items. The big reason they’re not doing more to totally overhaul their island or start anew is because the 3.0 update has a feature that’ll essentially do that itself—Resetti. Resetti’s Reset Service is a quality-of-life feature intended to clear up big swaths of an island; it’ll remove flowers, decorations, and fencing from a specific area. (Everything, including flowers, shrubs, and trees, will go straight into inventory.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My island is a mess because I refuse to do the man’s work for him, but I can’t wait to see that mess just poof into a blank canvas to start my new island theme,” Koester said.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of completely restarting, Koester spent the time between the 3.0 announcement and the update’s release day working on a series of different goals—primarily, prepping to complete the Nook Miles goals they set for themself. The 3.0 update’s bulk crafting mechanic, which lets players craft in bulk straight from their inventory, means it’ll be easier to finish some of the harder Nook Miles tasks. One of the Nook Miles challenges that’s notoriously hard to complete is crafting 3,000 furniture items. Koester is looking to reach this goal in a day when the update is released; they’re collecting coconuts so they can craft nearly a thousand Coconut Juices—a furniture item in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, which requires only coconuts to craft—in a day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I know everyone has a specific opinion or strategy for preparing for the update, whether it’s cataloguing items or gathering resources, but my personal opinion is to prepare for what is going to give you the most joy in the game,” Koester said. “If that means restarting your island on update day to get the full 3.0 experience on a new island, do that. If that means cleaning out your inventory on your five-year-old forever island, do that! If that means collecting a crapton of coconuts like an obsessive gaming gremlin, do that. Prep is all in the mindset, not in specific gameplay.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Lemmy, meanwhile, has spent the time between the update announcement and January 15 working through the early hours of any new island—opening the museum, saving resources.</span></p> <p><span>“I just wanted a fresh start, especially to experience some of the changes and the DLC with a clean canvas, making use of the new items and features without ripping everything up first,” he told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “My preparation is kind of just that—restarting. But also I’m just saving resources, not worrying about decorating my island or anything yet, and just progressing through the early parts of the game with as little planning as I can.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659000">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Players that are restarting don’t have to go it alone, though: Lots of players on social media and forums are offering to help support players looking to start over. “I’ve been going on and off mystery islands to collect materials for restart care packages,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pqbpn7/comment/nut7toc/"><span>one person on Reddit wrote</span></a><span>. There’s no right or wrong way to experience a new update, but some players, indeed, do feel pressure to do things the “right” way; lots of players have spent a lot of time on their islands, perfecting every little detail, or rushing to gobble up all the new content.</span></p>

 <p><span>But Koester wants to remind players that even the most seasoned players, like them, don’t necessarily feel prepared.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a big change to the game, with new mechanics, new buildings, new NPCs, and new items,” they said. “Seasoned and new players alike will experience it at the same time for the first time, which in itself is a pretty magical feeling to share. If you’re worried, just know that everyone is going through the ‘new’ feeling, and take it slow. Not everything has to be experienced at once. So no matter what, whether you’re starting a new island, had your island for years, stopped playing for a time, there is no being late to experiencing joy. You’re fashionably on time.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987]]></content:encoded>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is now available to play in full on PC following release, and symptoms are a crucial mechanic that can make or break your playthrough.</p>



<p>Available on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including with a Game Pass subscription</a>, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts you in charge of the entry of survivors into a camp during a zombie apocalypse, and it’s down to you to decide whether a survivor is showing signs of being infected.</p>



<p>Remembering all the symptoms can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with a breakdown on what survivors can show, and the action you should take as a result.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">All Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check are a crucial stage of the game, and processing a survivor incorrectly can quickly lead to disaster, so it’s important to know what each symptom indicates.</strong></p>



<p>You can uncover symptoms by using a variety of tools that are at your disposal, though you won’t have access to all of these immediately upon entering the game, as others are unlocked through progression.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the symptoms available in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and the action you should take with those displaying them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Symptom</th><th data-align="center">Survivor Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Freckles</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bruises</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Conjuctivitis</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">37 to 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">120 to 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hyper Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sneezing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hiccups</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Coughing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sick Breath</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Necrosis</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bite Mark</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Red Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cross Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">How to Deal With Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>



<p><strong>There are three approaches to dealing with survivors in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check. You can either allow them to pass, send them to quarantine, or deny their entry.</strong></p>



<p>The correct choice is uncovered by discovering the symptoms a survivor is showing, highlighting whether they’re safe to pass or risk spreading an infection. If an infection is confirmed, entry should be denied, and if it’s suspected, but not guaranteed, the safe choice is to send them to quarantine.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy breakdown of what to do with each survivor based on the symptoms they show.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Good to Go: </strong>Safe to allow the survivor to pass through the checkpoint.</li>



<li><strong>Possibly Infected: </strong>Send the survivor to quarantine to monitor their symptoms further.</li>



<li><strong>Infected: </strong>Deny entry. </li>
</ul>

                <p>When single developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone officially released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> in 2016, the farm-life sim wasn't intended to have any voiceovers. That hasn't stopped a dedicated fan from creating a Stardew Valley mod that adds vocal performances to the game.</p><p>Voice actress and software engineer Shannon Hobby released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22550?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Stardew Valley voice over mod</a> as a proof of concept in 2024. But this week, Hobby has updated the mod with vocal performances for all of the romanceable characters in the game. Hobby's intent is give every character in the game a voice, but it's still a work in progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1f9o67Y5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z1f9o67Y5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm a voice actor and software engineer and I've combine these skills to make something wonderful for a game that I really care about that's super important to me and I know is important to a lot of people," said Hobby in her initial announcement video. "I think this was a perfect opportunity to combine those skill sets and make something that I'm proud of for a game that I really care about and give back to the community a little bit."</p><p>Hobby went on to explain that she is not using generative AI for the game's voices. Instead, all of the voices are provided by real people whom Hobby has paid out of her own pocket. She also shared the cast list below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JanFuzzball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Michelle</a> as Emily</li><li><a href="https://heiditabing.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heidi Tabing</a> as Penny</li><li><a href="https://thatdamvoice.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Meyers</a> as Sebastian</li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/@saiyanserenityv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kemi Haydee Stanton</a> as Haley</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aiden_dawn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aiden Dawn</a> as Leah</li><li><a href="http://www.eamonkinsmanvo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eamon Kinsman</a> as Alex</li><li><a href="https://x.com/hopkinsjacob5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jacob Hopkins</a> as Sam</li><li><a href="https://www.gmhakim.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GM Hakim</a> as Harvey</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/TPOTcos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nia Celeste</a> as Maru</li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/animenji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmanuel "Menji" Menjivar</a> as Elliott</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DianaJurand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Jurand</a> as Abigail</li><li>Jonathan David Bullock as Shane</li></ul><p>Audio Editing Assistance was provided by Victoria Cheng.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PEAK - Roots Biome Update Teaser Trailer</p>

<p>"Four bucks is also kind of five bucks. Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free," Kaman continued. "So we've got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks... that's ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn't become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal."</p><p>This "eight bucks is five bucks" joke originated in conversations between developers at Landfall and Aggro Crab, when developers from both studios were working together to create Peak. While Peak originally launched at a reduced price of $5, its standard price is $8, or more specifically $7.99, based on the pricing of Landfall's indie horror hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/content-warning/" data-ref-id="5000-624337">Content Warning</a>.</p><p>Even though Kaman's whole joke is kind of confusing and hard to follow, psychological pricing is a very real science in the business world, and the strategy seems to have paid off for Peak. The offbeat co-operative climbing game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">third best-selling game on Steam</a> over the holiday season, moving almost 800,000 copies in just two weeks.</p><p>Peak is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for $4.95--basically $5--which is the cheapest price the indie hit has sold for since it released in June.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Lego fully unveiled its official Pokémon sets, which include the rather chonky Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model. This chap was notable not only for its size and price tag (it is retailing for £579.99), but the fact that if you pre-ordered it, you would also get your hands on the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection as a gift with purchase while stocks lasted.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chsnos.bsky.social/post/3mcabspu3rs2s">many soon took to social media</a> to say they would actually quite like to just buy the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection, please and thank you, rather than being made to shell out close to £600 (which is more than a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>) for a set they don't really want, just to get the freebie.</p>

<p>Now, and unsurprisingly, the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is popping up on resale sites such as eBay. And while Lego itself said the set is worth roughly £25 here in the UK, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pokemon+lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">many of those listings already marked as sold have gone for over £100</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">similar story internationally</a> as well.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/lego-offers-promotions/latest-terms-and-conditions">Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection's terms and conditions</a>, the gift offer was only valid for the first 8500 pre-orders of the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set here in the UK. In the US, that number was for the first 21,840 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the set itself was available for pre-order yesterday when the collection was first announced, sales pages in the UK and internationally now simply state that the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set is "coming soon", and interested parties are currently no longer able to secure themselves a model ahead of release through Lego.</p><p>It should be noted here, that even though the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is appearing for sale on the likes of eBay, the sellers will not yet have the set in their hands, as it is not due to be shipped until 27th February.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego x Pokémon partnership was first teased back in March,</a> before getting fully revealed yesterday. As well as the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">this collection also includes a Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a>, and a smaller, cheaper model of Eevee with posable features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil Showcase for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is coming this week, airing on Thursday 15th January at 10PM GMT. For those of you outside the meanest of timezones, that’s 2PM PT, 5PM ET, 11PM CET, 7AM JST (16th Jan).</p>
<p><iframe title="Teaser Trailer - Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase tamely promises “<span dir="auto">brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem”, which definitely sounds plausible to me, but what new details are there to know? And how delicately will Capcom have to avoid getting too spoilery?</span></p>
<p>We already know a decent amount about the game. This ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft who is sent out into the field to investigate murders at a spooky hotel… which also happens to be where her mum was murdered.</p>
<p>Back at the game’s announcement, Capcom talked up having a new character who wasn’t so well versed in handling the horrors unleashed into the world. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/">As Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>But then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">they’ve made Leon a playable character anyway</a>! What this means practically is that Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, and Leon gets to do all the fun gun-slinging action stuff.</p>
<p>There’s also rumours of another returning character as well, and Capcom do have a tendency to throw in a random multiplayer game mode with their Resi games. I guess we’ll see if those appear in this showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New GOG Owner Isn’t Afraid of Taking on Steam: ‘They Already Have 80%, It Should Be Easier to Take from Them’]]></title>

            <guid>1404331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just two days before the end of 2025, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had sold its digital video game distribution platform <strong>GOG</strong></a> (formerly <strong>Good Old Games</strong>) to <strong>Michał Kiciński</strong>, who had co-founded the company (and CD Projekt RED itself), for $25 million.</p>



<p>Now, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published an interview with Kiciński</a>, who had retired after leaving CD Projekt RED on the very day that the company shared the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Cyberpunk 2077 teaser trailer</a>, on January 10, 2013. After several years out of the gaming industry, Kiciński appears eager to dive back in and is unafraid of the proverbial elephant in the room: <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just surpassed a new user concurrency record this past Sunday</a>. </p>



<p><em>I see opportunities more than negatives, that's my nature, and I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow. And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80% of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me, it's the opposite. I see: 'Oh, there is one big competitor, it'll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80%, so it should be easier to take the market from them.' GOG has its own strengths and really should focus on maintaining them and even strengthening them. There is no need to try to be like the others. GOG has its own identity and its own uniqueness, which is very much appreciated by gamers.</em> <em>Steam is winning with its ease of use. In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general.</em></p>



<p>In any case, Kiciński <strong>clarified that he does not plan to directly challenge Steam on triple-A game offerings</strong>, as Epic Games Store did, instead favoring deals with smaller developers and publishers. However, the platform <strong>will continue to sell CD Projekt RED's games at a rate favorable for the Polish developer</strong>, so fans who'd like to support CDPR should still pick GOG over other platforms if they want more of their money to go directly toward the studio.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> recently concluded its first Expedition, this being a voluntary, narrative-led character reset achieved by hoarding and donating resources over a set period. The idea is vaguely that you’re funding a mighty caravan to the boondocks. In return, you’ll get tiered rewards such as faster progression, bonus skill points and a larger stash. Participation in Expedition is split across various stages with different completion requirements – the final leg of the first one saw players amassing non-specific items worth hundreds of thousands of coins.</p>
<p>Being opt-in, Expeditions are designed to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">a gentler alternative</a> to the playerbase-wide seasonal ‘prestiging’ mechanics or progression wipes of other online games. Developers Embark say just over a million people took part in the first Expedition – Arc Raiders has sold around 12 million copies to date – with "something close to about 35% or 40%” of those players bagging the full set of Expedition skill points, in the words of design director Virgil Watkins.</p> <!--more--><p>
I am no StatWhisperer and cannot say whether this is an amazing success, by the standards of games with progress resets. Watkins feels it’s a good start, but also says there’s room for improvement. Specifically, he thinks the closing stage of the inaugural expedition was too much of a slog for pennies.
</p><p>"One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points,” he told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">PCGamesN</a> in a new interview, “and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on."</p>
<p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p><p>Watkins would like future Expeditions to be about more than amassing huge amounts of cash. "We completely acknowledge that it isn't the most engaging thing to just go for money,” he continued, “[and it has] the potential outcome of disincentivizing using your gear, which is kind of what people look forward to towards the end of a reset cycle. So yeah, we're looking at revisions on that." </p>
<p>Aside from going over reactions to the Expedition rewards in themselves, the developers are studying player data to see if they can "bring a little more variety" to the process for more casual Expedition participants. They don’t want these players to “feel as though they're being left [behind]," Watkins said.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m rarely enticed by opportunities to ‘prestige’ a character. I don’t find grinding for the privilege of giving it all away very prestigious. I’d be more interested if there were some degree of mystery involved – perhaps it could be less about building percentages, more about solving an oblique puzzle that requires a resource investment of some kind.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that designing what are broadly exercises in rebalancing an in-game economy takes a lot of skill - Embark have elsewhere talked to us intriguingly about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">the dark art of creating a “meaningful” item meta</a>. Anyway, did you join the Expedition? How did it go?</p>

            <guid>1404325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="5578d516-004a-443d-9021-2e45e479675c" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="554">For many people today, space is a luxury. City living often means smaller apartments, compact desks, and the constant challenge of fitting everything you need into a limited footprint. When it comes to computers, that reality can make a bulky PC tower feel impractical, if not impossible. You want something powerful enough to handle work and play, but small enough that it doesn’t dominate your workspace. This is where mini PCs step in—and KAMRUI’s Hyper H1 mini gaming PC is a compelling example of how much performance can be packed into a small box.</p>
<p data-start="556" data-end="985">KAMRUI has been steadily building a reputation for compact computing solutions, and the Hyper H1 is designed with gamers and power users in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/">Right now, the Hyper H1 is seeing a significant discount, with savings of up to 31% off its original $549 price. Depending That drops the price down to just $379 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="987" data-end="1503">At the heart of the Hyper H1 is an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor. This is an 8-core, 16-thread mobile CPU capable of boosting up to 4.7GHz, which gives it plenty of horsepower for demanding everyday tasks. Paired with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the system is well-equipped for multitasking, productivity, and moderate gaming right out of the box. For users who want more headroom, memory can be upgraded to 64GB, and storage can be expanded up to 4TB with a compatible SSD.</p>
<p data-start="2040" data-end="2558">Connectivity is another strong point. The compact chassis houses six USB-A 3.2 ports, making it easy to connect a mouse, keyboard, controller, or external drives. There’s also a USB-C port, along with HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, allowing support for up to three monitors simultaneously. The Hyper H1 can drive displays at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz refresh rates, which is impressive for a mini PC. On the networking side, it includes dual-band Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet, and Bluetooth 5.2 for flexible connectivity.</p>


<h2 data-start="2560" data-end="2870">Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p data-start="56" data-end="447">Although many TVs now include built-in streaming apps and affordable devices like Fire TV and Roku are widely available, a mini PC can still be an excellent choice for powering your home theater. A mini PC supports a broad range of video formats and allows you to play media stored locally. Its compact design also makes it easy to tuck away behind your TV or inside an entertainment center.</p>
<p data-start="449" data-end="738" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Many users choose mini PCs as the foundation for a PLEX server, giving them access to their media libraries from virtually anywhere. They’re also well suited for retro game emulation, since older games require minimal processing power. Just make sure any ROMs you use are obtained legally. I’m sure you would never consider downloading a ROM you don’t own…</p>
