I’ve reached out to EA to see how <em>NHL 25</em> builds these playoff brackets and will update this story accordingly if I hear back. Until then, I’m texting my family pictures of the New York Rangers looking triumphant. Let’s go, boys. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite is about to get quite villainous. According to a new leak, Fortnite is set to receive three new Disney villains relatively soon.</p>



<p>HypeX, who is known to post various Fortnite leaks, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1843659867053343017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted Tuesday</a> that Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil, and Maleficent will be available when the next update drops.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The additions come as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/">crossover deal</a> between Disney and Epic Games. As far as in what way they’ll be added to the game hasn’t been confirmed. One thing Disney has made known is that not every character added to Fortnite will be able to use guns, which would limit their ability to be used in the classic Fortnite Battle Royale. </p>



<p>“Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> last week. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”</p>







<p>Disney and Fortnite’s collaboration will continue to grow aside from the additions of characters to the game. Epic Games and Disney are also working on new games as well as a full Disney universe within Fortnite.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Disney villains coming to Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.</p>

You'll need to click the coupons on the respective pages to get these discounts.</p><p>If you're looking to get an iPad for more general use, there are also some deals on older models. For general browsing and bedtime Netflix, there's the 2021 base iPad for $258, while the sixth-generation iPad Mini with 64GB of storage capacity will cost you $350. In the Macbook department, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23GFMJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2024 MacBook Air for $1,044</a>. This is a pretty powerful laptop, as it has a 15-inch liquid retina display, a powerful M3 chip, and 256GB of storage capacity, making it a solid workhorse to lug around. For something a bit more compact, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's a 13-inch version for $849</a>.</p><p>Pairing these with headsets is also a good idea, especially if you're sticking with Apple so that you can take advantage of extra features. The standout deal here are the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds for $168 (was $250), as these little titans provide exceptional active noise-canceling, dynamic sound, and a USB-C connection for fast-charging. You can also check out the premium AirPods Max for a deluxe experience, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as the USB-C model is $499 for Prime Day</a>. If you don't mind a Lightning connection, you can save even more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and get a set of these elegant cans for $395</a>.</p><p>Artists can also benefit from Prime Day, as the Apple Pencils are on sale. You'll want to check the compatibility of each model before you decide on a price, but if you're looking to explore the world of digital art, these are game-changers. You'll be amazed at what you can create on an iPad with an app like Procreate or Adobe Fresco, and these stylus devices feel very comfortable to use.

Most of these are led by Colin Farrell, who is unrecognizable in his role as Oz Cobb aka The Penguin, and they add the briefest moments of levity to an otherwise heavy crime drama.<br></p><p>The most recent episode begins with a tragedy: The flooding of Gotham by the Riddler, first seen in 2022’s <em>The Batman</em>. We see how it affects Oz’s reluctant new henchman, Vic (Rhenzy Feliz), who over the course of the episode slowly settles into his role, discovering he might actually like being so flush with cash he can pay off cops. It’s also the start of Oz’s partnership with the deliciously unhinged Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti), who seems to be perpetually on the precipice of killing someone in her line of sight, like a coiled cobra in the grass. But despite all the tension simmering through episode three, I couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p>At one point, Sofia brings Oz to the factory where her team is hard at work on a new psychoactive drug that she smuggled out of Arkham. As an eccentric chemist explains the drug, cultivated from some freaky-looking mushrooms, in increasingly more scientific ways, he throws a few Latin words out there. Oz immediately snaps, “what the fuck you say to me?” like Tony Soprano with his hand on the butt of a gun. I guffawed.</p><p>Moments before that, Sofia shows up at Oz’s apartment, where a terrified Vic is forced to play the gracious host. She moves around the room, clearly disgusted by Oz’s interior decorating choices, picking up a remote like it’s covered in toxic waste. Vic goes to tell her what it’s for, but before he can finish, she clicks it and a huge electric fireplace kicks on. “Tacky,” she mumbles.<br></p><p>She’s not here to hang out though, they have an errand to run. Oz instructs Vic to remain in his apartment instead of tagging along. “Stay put,” he says, closing the door behind him. He opens it again immediately after and hisses, “If you do anything stupid, I’ll sense it.” It’s a master class, guys.<br></p><p>Though the rest of the episode is pretty high-stakes, there are consistent dashes of humor sprinkled throughout that consistently startle a peal of laughter out of me: Oz responding to a rival gang leader asking if they’re staring a coup with “What are you, reading books or somethin’?”, Vic splitting a gunman nearly in half with Oz’s plum-colored Maserati (it’s not purple, as he reminds us in episode one) just when you think our Penguin is done for, and Oz responding “fuck it, leave her,” when Vic asks what they should do about Sofia, who was also in the line of fire. They speed away in the destroyed Maserati while “Me And The Devil” plays.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w">Every single episode of <em>The Penguin</em> thus far has been like this</a></span>—terribly tense mobster moments that Oz gets out of by the skin of his one gold tooth, punctuated by surprisingly riotous riffs. It’s the best show on TV right now, and surprisingly one of the funniest. The fourth episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on Max on Sunday, October 13.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Polish developer The Farm 51 <a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-open-world-sequel-announced-for-2025-pc-requirements-already-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, the sequel to 2021's first-person shooter survival horror <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/chernobylite-babysit-your-friends-and-venture-into-the-exclusion-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a>, just before Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>While there, I had the chance to speak with Wojciech Pazdur, Development Director at The Farm 51, who discussed the big changes of this sequel, which is moving to the third-person open world role-playing game genre (albeit with an optional first-person view for exploration) and shooting for a much bigger game in terms of explorable area and playtime, not to mention optional support for cooperative multiplayer.</p>
<p>We also learned that the studio is tentatively targeting a Fall 2025 release window, that it would rather not follow the early access path used for the original game, and that a Nintendo Switch port of the first Chernobylite is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="CHERNOBYLITE 2: EXCLUSION ZONE - GAMEPLAY TRAILER [2025 ON PC &amp; CONSOLES]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6mEtQRWC2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you begin working on Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>We started working on it as soon as we launched the first game. However, Chernobylite 1 was never fully finished because we just released the last DLCs, the last expansion packs, a bit over a month ago. This is actually the end of our journey with Chernobylite 1. A port is coming for Nintendo Switch, but we are not developing the game ourselves.</p>
<p>We first started working on concepts and prototypes for Chernobylite 2 in the second half of 2021, so it's been almost three years today. The pre-production took us one year and a half, and we've been in production for over a year. We still have one year until the game is finished. Today, we are close to the Alpha stage, meaning you can play almost all the game. We actually wanted to wait to announce Chernobylite 2 up to the day when the first one was completely done from our aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to do early access again?</strong></p>
<p>We are considering early access. However, because of the scale of the project, we would prefer not to. We know that early access is very helpful. But if we went with early access, then probably the release date for the final game would be postponed, because early access gives you a lot of extra work. So today, we would prefer not to go for early access, but we will see how our playtest goes and how our talks with investors and the publisher regarding the distribution model go.</p>
<p>Ultimately, early access gave us an enormous amount of value-added feedback for the first game, helping us make a better game. Looking just from this perspective, early access is a good tool. But for a game of this scale, supporting and managing early access would be heavy for us because the game is many times bigger than the original.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main improvements you're planning for Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>We originally didn't even think of it as a sequel. We simply wanted to make the game we envisioned from the beginning. Chernobylite had a tiny budget, team, and schedule, as well as many technological limitations.</p>
<p>For instance, we always wanted to make it an open world game, but with Unreal Engine 4, it was too hard for us to keep this level of visual quality and make it open world. We had to make a game with very limited locations, a very small amount of characters, gadgets, weapons, and mechanics. Everything was very restricted from the beginning because of our team size, our technology expertise in Unreal Engine 4, and our budget, of course.</p>
<p>With Chernobylite 2, we knew we had a strong design foundation and a proven world setting. Actually, we had an internal joke: we codenamed the second game ChernobyFull. That speaks to how much we wanted this game to be the full,&nbsp;top-of-the-line experience that we wanted to create from scratch.</p>
<p>Meaning, first of all, an open world RPG. We wanted more characters, more character interactions, and more things to do regarding the different stories. We have also been adding a lot of content, like weapons, gadgets, mechanics, enemies, and so on, but it was not just our vision. We talked with Chernobylite 1 players; we have been constantly asking players, including very detailed surveys, to give insight on the best and worst elements of Chernobylite 1. Most of the players said yes, exploration, an open world, and then more characters, more gadgets, and more ways of progressing through the story. We agreed that, yes, this is also what we would like to do. So we simply made this world 20 times bigger world, and the playtime two to three times longer.</p>
<p>We have more characters, and these characters have faces and talk to you. In the original game, everybody wore gas masks because we couldn't afford to make facial animations. We also have factions. In the original game, there were only a few characters in the whole zone, but here, the zone is divided into areas run by factions, and each faction has its representatives. If you cooperate with them, you gain their respect, and you can also unlock training that will provide special abilities. These are somehow related to what this faction is doing. We have mutants, scientists, and mercenaries.</p>
<p>Since it is an open world, you can walk around Pripyat City and then get back to the power plant, or you can use the quick travel option, which in our game happens through teleport-like devices. Besides that, the skill and attribute systems are more like in RPG games. We have six main attributes now. You can also ask your companions to help with managing the base, becoming&nbsp;your quartermaster or gunsmith or workshop manager, let's say.</p>

We wanted more characters, more character interactions, and more things to do regarding the different stories. So we simply made this world 20 times bigger world, and the playtime two to three times longer.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you still send them on missions like in the previous game?</strong></p>
<p>We are not sending them in missions any longer. In the sequel, you are the one going on missions. But some of the missions are related to the characters that you have encountered, too, so sometimes they will appear in those missions.</p>
<p>The game still has an optional first-person view for exploration to let you enjoy the visuals. We've got much more detail. There is multilayered foliage all over the terrain. We have improved the density and quality of all models. Even with open world, it's much more detailed than it was than it was before. We also have full body awareness, so you see the body of your character when using first person view.</p>
<p>The biggest change is that the main mode is third-person view, mostly to give it an RPG feel. We didn't want to be compared too much with games like S. T. A. L. K. E. R. or METRO. It was an issue trying to do that because it was too often compared to S. T. A. L. K. E. R., which was not actually a reference to our game. Also, since we are doing an RPG, we have expanded melee combat. We see today that this combat system simply works better.</p>
<p>With Chernobylite, we were proud of everything except the fact that the players said our combat was just average. There is not much room for story-driven first-person shooters if they are cheap. Not having a triple-A budget, we decided we would not continue pursuing first-person shooters. We are going our own way. We believe in going toward RPG.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any other unique feature in Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It is called Planewalking. At almost any time in the game, you can summon another version of yourself from another dimension. It may have different weapons, it may have different abilities, and it may be suited well for different playstyles. This allows you to change your character on the fly into different builds. For example, this scientist doesn't have a typical shooting weapon, but he has some special ability, which is not actually magic; it's physical-based stuff, but he can throw fireballs.</p>
<p><strong>Are you worried that some players will be disappointed with this change of perspective?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually, we know it's an issue. This is why we are keeping a big part of the game, which is exploration, in first person. We hope the players will forgive us because we had this tested by both existing fans and new fans. Even existing fans said this new system plays much better. Shooting in first person in Chernobylite was simply average. That's what we knew and that's what we heard. Third-person combat actually works better in our game.</p>
<p><strong>I remember from the official announcement that you're also adding coop mode, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, although I cannot show it to you right now. This was one of the things that players really demanded. Still, Chernobylite 2 is more like a single-player narrative RPG with the ability to play coop. For some missions, it is better to bring somebody along.</p>
<p>Whenever you're in the base, you can use the radio. In the first game, you could only use it to receive some messages from other characters. Now, though, you can use it to connect with other people and meet them to explore another dimension and tackle the greatest challenges. But if you want to play the game just on your own, it's also possible.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With Planewalking, at almost any time in the game, you can summon another version of yourself from another dimension.

<p><strong>Do you plan to create dungeon-like content for co-op players where you have to fight a big boss or something like that?</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to spoil too much, but yes, for instance, some of the bosses would be better dedicated to be fought with the help of friends. Also, there are special locations. I didn't show it much to you right now, but we also have dungeons and even huge towers. So, in general, you will not just be walking over the surface of the game, but you will, at some point, see many more different structures and different locations than just a huge flat area covered with forest and some ruins. We definitely have more of different locations over and under the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a day/night cycle in Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we got it.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any change to the enemies during nighttime?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are many aspects of the game that change when you play at different moments of the day cycle and in different weather. This actually affects the behavior and perception of the enemies.</p>
<p><strong>The game is made with Unreal Engine 5, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's all done in Unreal Engine 5. We have moved most of the content from the original game here, but because we are using Unreal Engine 5 and we've got Nanite, this content is heavily upgraded over the original Chernobylite. We have been using the 3D scans of the real Chernobyl exclusion zone.</p>
<p>The source materials already have millions of polygons, but we optimized them in Chernobylite 1 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, so they couldn't be as detailed as they are now with Nanite. Even the same source data that we captured five years ago can now be displayed in much higher resolution. It didn't make sense for us to rescan Chernobyl again because we would end up with the same source data. We just reprocessed it to give it much more detail and polygons. And, of course, textures are also higher resolution, so right now, the game is more detailed, including things like the foliage. It's also using the advantages of Nanite technology.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine you're also using Lumen, right?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, yes. Actually, it has brought us a lot of optimization issues so far, and we are, let's say, in the stage of optimizing that today.</p>
<p><strong>It was announced at some point that Chernobylite would add support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, but I don't think it was actually released. Is it going to be in this one?</strong></p>
<p>For Chernobylite 1, the issue was that it appeared when most of the games were switching from the old generation to the next generation. So Chernobylite 1 was optimized to support the widest range of hardware systems, such as old and new consoles. The lowest graphic cards that we have been supporting, and I personally optimized the game for, were GeForce GTX 660.</p>
<p>Today, because we're using Unreal 5 and going only for newer consoles, like PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, we'll also increase the minimum requirements, as it doesn't make sense to support those old GPUs today.</p>
<p>We will definitely put much more effort into everything to make games work well and smoothly with the more recent generation of cards. With Chernobylite 1, we really wanted to do more, but there was simply not enough manpower to provide support for both low-end, high-end, middle-end, and so on. We'll see about DLSS because we also need to support FSR.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a meeting today with NVIDIA where we are discussing what could be the best way of utilizing their different technologies within the game, both the ones that are available today and the ones that will be available in one year when the game will be released in the final stage.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Generally, our goal is to be ready to release the final version of the game one year from now. I'm saying one year because it's probably going to be August or maybe September next year. We'll see. Generally, right now, we are announcing only the date 2025 because it depends on many different things. For instance, if we are doing a simultaneous launch on PC and consoles, if there maybe would be early access, if there will be physical distribution or digital only, and so on.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you are planning to launch Chernobylite 2 in Fall 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Generally, our goal is to be ready to release the final version of the game one year from now. I'm saying one year because it's probably going to be August or maybe September next year. We'll see. Generally, right now, we are announcing only the date 2025 because it depends on many different things. For instance, if we are doing a simultaneous launch on PC and consoles, if there maybe would be early access, if there will be physical distribution or digital only, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Would the game launch later on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>We are discussing right now with potential partners because we would need extra support to make it a sim launch on consoles alongside PC, and we need to check if it's worth doing that. Definitely, we want to be on PC and consoles because Chernobylite 1 was quite successful on both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Now you are launching the first game on Switch, correct?</strong></p>
<p>Chernobylite 1 will be launched on the Nintendo Switch console, hopefully late this year. We are just supporting the development of this version, which is mainly handled by an external company, a Polish developer with whom we are very friendly, and the project is already progressing well. I'm somehow supervising it and keeping up with their efforts, and so far, I'm playing Chernobylite 1 mostly on Switch.</p>
<p><strong>The Switch 2 is coming. Will Chernobylite 2 launch on the new Nintendo consoIe?</strong></p>
<p>I cannot say anything, but for sure, we won't launch Chernobylite 2 on the old generation of any consoles because this game will be too heavy and too big and Unreal 5 won't support it in a, let's say, reasonable time frame or amount of work. But what we can say for sure, we are today definitely confirming that we are targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, and for the other platforms that may appear in the meantime, all the discussions right now are quite secret.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

From the sounds of it, the newest <em>DBZ </em>title, which returns to the long-dormant <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>sub-series of arena fighters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">is a (ki-)blast</a></span>.

However, many players seem to be having trouble overcoming one of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s comically huge hurdles, and the game’s deeply funny community is already making light of the whole affair.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,195502,195624" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s story mode, dubbed Episode Battles here, you can relive some of the most famous fights from the renowned shonen and follow the stories of certain key characters. Of course, <em>Dragon Ball</em>’s longtime protagonist Goku is featured prominently in this mode, and his story is both one of the longest and most demanding of the bunch. Nowhere has that been more clear than in the showdown against Great Ape Vegeta, who is the first real boss you encounter in Goku’s story and has become the bane of many a player’s existence.</p><p>This trial has been absolutely kicking people’s asses since <em>Sparking Zero </em>became available to play, and it is downright hilarious seeing people react to its intense difficulty. From the clips that I’ve seen, Great Ape Vegeta’s well-earned reputation for giving players a hard time has to do with just how damn unrelenting he can be. He can evidently spam his beam attack (which also does splash damage as an extra bit of dirt in the wound) with relatively little charging in between—that or he charges his techniques much quicker than the player—and he has an utterly brutal command grab.</p><p>To make matters worse, it appears that Great Ape Vegeta can literally pull out either move to start a fight, and as you might expect, his attacks do <em>heavy </em>damage. Hilariously, there are clips of players immediately restarting the fight in the hope of getting optimal openings, which Great Ape Vegeta doesn’t seem prone to give often.</p><p>To complement his massive damage-dealing abilities, Great Ape Vegeta also dwarfs Goku in this fight, and shrugs off basic attacks like he’s swatting a fly thanks to his super armor. The whole thing seems like the funniest callback to Great Ape Vegeta’s appearance in the original <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em>, which was a pretty brutal fight as well. All I know is this monkey is being a motherfucker, and I’m <em>living </em>for the reactions to it.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SwagFish03/status/1843496836906237968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SwagFish03/status/1843496836906237968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fight isn’t impossible</a></span>, but it’s pretty damn brutal until you learn to sidestep the blasts and spam your own Kamehameha back at Great Ape Vegeta. For the folks who haven’t learned yet, Great Ape Vegeta has been ridiculously difficult, and some are already invoking comparisons to similarly tough boss battles in other games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s Radahn encounter</a></span>. Word on the street is that Great Ape Vegeta might not even be the toughest fight, either. All I’m saying is don’t let the Ginyu Force catch y’all outside.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has lifted the lid on the location for 2025’s prestigious Six Invitational, and it looks like we’re all shipping up to Boston! While we knew for months that the Six Invitational 2025 would land in North America, we didn’t know <strong>exactly </strong>where, but thanks to a recent announcement from Ubisoft, we can all start booking our flights and hotels.</p>



<p>This is the first Six Invitational to take place in the continental United States, with all previous events unfolding in Canada, Europe, or Brazil.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-boston-bound">Boston Bound</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has confirmed that the Six Invitational – the most ambitious and lucrative esports event in the Rainbow Six Siege scene – will land in Boston, Massachusetts in February 2025. You’d best wrap up warm – it won’t be as nice weather-wise as Sao Paolo, which is where the Six Invitational 2024 took place.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Teams are already starting to secure their spots at the Six Invitational in Boston, and more will be locked in as the BLAST R6 Major Montreal wraps up in the coming days.</p>



<p>Thus far, the likes of Cloud9 Beastcoast, Team BDS, DarkZero Esports, FaZe Clan, Team Secret, and Team Liquid have all qualified.</p>



<p>It’s almost the tenth anniversary of the Six Invitational, which is a staggering tournament that boasts a prize pool worth $3 million – one of the largest single pools in the esports industry. The 2025 edition will be the ninth event in Rainbow Six Siege’s history, and if 2024’s tournament is anything to go by, it’ll be nothing short of electrifying.</p>



<p>Tickets are available to purchase <strong>now</strong> if you’re interested. It’s taking place from February 14 – 16 at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway, right in the heart of the city.</p>



<p>Are you heading to Boston for the Six Invitational? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The bundle also includes a number of suggestions for what to create to help youngsters get inspired to start building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380710-screenshot2024-10-08at1.17.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4380710" data-ratio="0.66270566727605" data-width="1094" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380710-screenshot2024-10-08at1.17.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4380710"></a><figcaption>Lego Classic Vibrant Creative Brick Box is on sale now on Amazon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4380710-screenshot2024-10-08at1.17.26pm.png"></figure><p>This set is geared toward children, but older Lego fans have plenty of options to consider, too, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-fans-look-here-lego-disney-camera-set-is-on-sale-right-now-for-a-great-price/1100-6526947/" data-ref-id="1100-6526947">Lego Disney vintage camera set that's also on sale for Prime Big Deal Days.</a></p><p>If <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-your-army-with-these-halo-mega-bloks-prime-deals/1100-6526984/" data-ref-id="1100-6526984">Lego is not your thing,</a> Prime Big Deal Days has lots of other stuff on sale as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/halo-studios-project-foundry-microsoft-343-industries-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/a-new-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly rechristened Halo Studios</a>, <em>Halo </em>is back, and this time, it’s more <em>Halo </em>than ever. And I mean, of course it is. As one of Xbox’s most iconic tentpoles, it is not – and likely never will be – allowed to die. But in a just world, the series would already be six feet under, with a Grunt dancing on its grave.</p><p>After the initially-promising misfire that was <em>Halo Infinite</em>, Microsoft is overhauling its approach to the series with a new engine, Unreal Engine 5, and a studio reorganization that will allow for work on multiple projects at once. This follows <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1843084939363049838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs of almost 100 people</a> from what was then called 343 Industries just last year. Now, based on the language used in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/a-new-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> about Halo Studios, Microsoft is clearly looking to hire.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s another in-built benefit – Unreal is familiar to huge parts of the wider gaming industry,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Xbox Wire</a> in its post about <em>Halo</em>’s future. “Where developers would have to spend time learning how to use Slipspace when joining 343, Halo Studios’ adoption of the industry-leading engine makes it a far smoother process to bring in new talent (and the studio is indeed hiring for its new projects now).”&nbsp;</p><p>The switch to Unreal is almost certainly a good call for the series, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/how-microsoft-s-halo-infinite-went-from-disaster-to-triumph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a> pegged the creaky Slipspace engine as a source of innumerable issues, robbing <em>Infinite </em>of its momentum with a glacial update schedule. To show off what’s possible in the new engine, Halo Studios created Project Foundry, which it says is “neither a game nor a tech demo,” but which is very much rooted in classic <em>Halo </em>iconography. There’s the “Pacific Northwest” landscape that calls back to <em>Halo 1</em>’s earliest moments; “Coldlands,” which references the series’ long history of snow levels; and “Blightlands,” an alien world that has been consumed by the parasitic Flood enemy faction that Master Chief and his many frenemies can never quite seem to get rid of.</p><p>It all looks suitably impressive, which is, again, the point: "The original <em>Halo </em>franchise was a graphics showcase,” lead FX artist Daniel Henley said in Halo Studios’ video. “It was best-in-class. That's what <em>Halo </em>was when it first was released, and that's what <em>Halo </em>needs to be again."</p><p>The most annoying people on the internet have already begun <a href="https://x.com/adashtra/status/1843285914975715362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doomsaying over the presence of queer and non-white game developers</a> in said video, which is a great way to forever exile yourself both from your local Arby’s and into a tribe of bleating manbabies who will never love you as much as they hate themselves. This is, to be clear, an incredibly stupid reason to fear for the future of <em>Halo</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>My reasoning is much simpler: <em>Halo</em>, as an idea, has run its course.&nbsp;</p><p>Graphics are not the first thing that grabbed me about the original <em>Halo</em>, and I don’t think I’m alone in that regard. Yeah, the game looked good, but more importantly, it plunged me headlong into a vast universe of intrigue. Why was The Covenant hell-bent on extinguishing humanity? What were the Forerunners? Where did The Flood come from? What was the purpose of this gargantuan ring? What happened to the other Spartans? Why was Master Chief the only man for the job?&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s in-media-res approach to storytelling and worldbuilding made my imagination run wild. I played the first game’s campaign more times than I can count. I saw Master Chief’s story through to what seemed to be its conclusion in <em>Halo 3</em>. I spent my high school money and free time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEWEdIcx1DI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading official <em>Halo </em>books</a>. In college, I tore through the underappreciated <em>Halo ODST</em>, as well as <em>Halo Reach</em>, Bungie’s beloved series swan song. Even by that point, though, I began to feel like <em>Halo </em>was growing a little long in the tooth. Many of the above questions about the series’ universe had been answered. <em>Reach</em>’s levels felt more like a greatest hits collection than anything truly novel. After that, I drifted from the series.</p><p><em>Halo 4</em> attempted something of a reset, featuring a new setting, weapons, and enemies. I feel like it at least had the right idea as far as freshening up the universe goes, but it failed to stick the landing. <em>Halo 5</em> added a secondary protagonist to the story, Locke, and put its own spin on multiplayer, but it was a narrative mess. This to say nothing of spinoffs like the <em>Halo Wars</em> games, real-time strategy affairs that hewed closer to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/vg3sd/til_halo_was_originally_going_to_be_a_rts_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s original vision for <em>Halo</em></a> than even <em>Halo 1</em> itself<em> </em>but which lacked the needed depth to stand on their own. <em>Halo </em>was lost in the wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Halo Infinite</em> was supposed to be a course correction, a return to form with an open-ish world that was nonetheless extremely reminiscent of Bungie’s level-based <em>Halo</em> games in terms of visuals, weapons, and enemies. To a degree, it succeeded, but its campaign ended abruptly and unsatisfyingly, and multiplayer – while punchy and fun – quickly grew stale. Do I think more frequent updates could have helped on that side of things? Sure. But I’m not sure <em>Halo Infinite</em> would have blossomed into the live-service-adjacent pseudo-platform Microsoft was hoping it would become, something <em>Halo </em>was never designed to be. The series’ systems and core gameplay loop were first established in the early 2000s; they weren’t meant to sustain an entire ecosystem.</p><p>For better or worse, <em>Halo </em>cannot leave those things behind. They <em>are Halo</em>. Nor can it entirely abandon Master Chief, The Covenant, The Flood, The Forerunners, The Spartans, or any of its many other proper nouns. These are its best-known quantities, and when they even sort of take a backseat, as we saw with <em>Halo 4 </em>and <em>5</em>, fans begin to long for greener, more Pacific-Northwest-inspired pastures.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft will never let <em>Halo </em>die, and that strikes me as tragic in its own way. The best stories have endings, something increasingly rare in this age of Marvel, <em>Star Wars</em>, and other franchise behemoths. And while there’s something beautifully bittersweet in a long goodbye, things get awkward if you wait around in the doorway for too long. Slowly but surely, everyone comes to realize that you’re dragging your feet not because there’s something real left in that moment, but because you’re afraid to move on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-reveals-new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-options/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, BioWare released a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> that provides a deep dive into Dragon Age: The Veilguard's accessibility options to make the game as accessible as possible to those who have disabilities and may need extra customization or tweaks to make the game playable for them.&nbsp; The accessibility considerations have been separated into four categories. The accessibility options have been in the design documentation from very early in Dragon Age: The Veilguard's development process, with the options being made with "thoughtful and deliberate implementation of accessibility."</p>
<p>The blog post states that they want to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a fun experience for everyone, regardless of skill or ability. First and foremost, there are multiple combat and difficulty settings. There are classic settings, such as the Storyteller option, which is for those who want to just experience the story without difficulty. Then there are options such as Underdog and Nightmare, which make the combat incredibly challenging and punishing. Additionally, there is an option named Unbound, which allows players to customize all game settings.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Once a player has selected a difficulty, there are more combat options that can be tweaked in the Settings menu, which can help the player make further changes, such as parry timing, aim assist, and aggressiveness of enemies. For those who prefer a cleaner UI and HUD, there are also customizable elements within them, such as elements like Rook's health being completely hidden, as well as the objective tracker or Mini Map.</p>
<p>When it comes to visual accessibility options, players will be able to tweak all of the text size in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. This includes text size in the UI and subtitles, which also have modifiers such as size, opacity, speaker names, and color. There is also the option for audio aids to add to visual-only elements, such as attack indicators. There are also color filters that can improve visibility as well as help those who have color blindness.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there, as there are also the options of Persistent Dot Option and Motion Blur which can be turned off. Camera Shake can be adjusted, with players able to tweak the options from 0-100%. Compared to a lot of games that have been released to a modern audience, BioWare is seemingly going above and beyond to make sure Dragon Age: The Veilguard is accessible and enjoyable for all audiences. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-officially-gold-bioware-confirms/">The title</a> is set to release on 31 October 2024.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265296/new-york-times-nyt-games-zorse-test</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265296/new-york-times-nyt-games-zorse-test<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The New York Times</em> is starting to beta test a new puzzle game called “<em>Zorse</em>,” as <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/08/2024/the-new-york-times-is-testing-a-new-puzzle-called-zorse">reported by <em>Semafor</em></a><em>. </em>The game is a “new phrase guessing game where every puzzle is a mash-up of two phrases,” <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. As <em>Semafor</em> points out, the <em>Zorse</em> name “identifies the offspring of a zebra and another equine,” so it seems like the game will focus on wordplay like that.</p><p>Cohen says <em>Zorse</em> is currently only available in Canada, meaning I can’t play it myself. But my Canada-based colleague Andrew Webster gave it a shot and told me about it; the game sounds a bit like <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> with a puzzle-y twist.</p><p>When you start a <em>Zorse</em> puzzle, you’re given a clue and shown a series of blank tiles that, when revealed, spell out a phrase related to the clue.

This data reveals, among other things, how Muah users interacted with the chatbots<em>. 404 Media</em>, saw the stolen data and writes that in many cases, users were allegedly trying to create chatbots that could role-play as children.</p><p> “I went to the site to jerk off (to an *adult* scenario, to be clear) and noticed that [Muah.ai] looked like it was put together pretty poorly,” the hacker explained to <em>404 Media</em>. “It’s basically a handful of open-source projects duct-taped together. I started poking around and found some vulnerabilities relatively quickly. At the start, it was mostly just curiosity but I decided to contact [<em>404 Media</em>] once I saw what was in the database.”</p><p>According to <em>404 Media</em>, some of the hacked data contains explicit prompts and messages about sexually abusing toddlers. The outlet reports that it saw one prompt that asked for an orgy with “newborn babies” and “young kids.” <em>404 Media </em>and the hacker couldn’t confirm if Muah.ai actually generated what the users were trying to get, but it’s a dark look at what many people are trying to use controversial AI generation tools to create. </p><p><em>404 Media</em> says that the admin of Muah.ai, who is known as Harvard Han, detected the hack last week. The person running the AI chatbot site also claimed that the hack was “financed” by chatbot competitors in the “uncensored AI industry.” <em>404 Media </em>asked for evidence of this claim and didn’t receive any. The hacker told the outlet they don’t work in the AI industry.</p><p>“We have a team of moderation staff that suspend and delete ALL child-related chatbots on our card gallery, Discord, Reddit, etc,” said Han. The card gallery is the list of community-created AI chatbots available on the site. <br></p><p>As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em>, Muah.ai claims to be an “uncensored” AI chatbot platform, allowing explicit conversations and photos to be created. However, it also claims to ban all underage content according to its website. When two people posted about a reportedly underage AI character on the site’s Discord server, <em>404 Media</em> claims a moderator to the users to not “post that shit” here, but to go “DM each other or something.”</p><p>It’s yet another example of how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atrioc-twitch-deepfake-porn-apology-dmca-ai-takedown-1850229681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atrioc-twitch-deepfake-porn-apology-dmca-ai-takedown-1850229681">AI generation tools </a></span>and chatbots are becoming easier to develop and share online, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laws and regulations around these new pieces of tech are lagging far behind</a></span>.

One of the most important of these ingredients you’ll need is salt, and it’s not particularly easy to come by if you don’t know how. Let’s fix that.</p><h2 id="h11948"><a id=""></a><strong>How to find salt in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></strong></h2><p>There are three main ways to obtain Salt, and if you intend to level up your cooking skills and be the best chef you can be, I recommend that you make the most of all three sources.

You should always have Amitoi Expeditions going, whether you’re looking for salt or not, but when you <em>are</em> in need you should make sure you’re sending your little friends on expeditions that offer this ingredient.</p><p>One such expedition is Urstella Fields, which can net you up to eight Salt per run. Send your Amitoi on this expedition and check back as soon as possible, so you can keep them out farming for more. Every moment you don’t have an Amitoi Expedition going is a moment you’re not getting Salt, dammit.</p><figure id="" data-id="068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-recommend-id="image://068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-recommend-id="image://068730d5d95575743e2e2e5a2d5539bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing where to get some damned salt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h11950"><a id=""></a><strong>2) Slaying certain enemies</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Many enemies in the world can drop Salt, but you may be surprised at how rare it can be.

<p>Coffee Stain has revealed that Goat Simulator: Remastered will be released worldwide on November 7. It has been more than a decade since the original game launched, and in little more than a month, it’ll be dropping <strong>again </strong>on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. When Goat Simulator: Remastered was announced, it was confirmed that all previously released DLC would be available with the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-goat-of-games">GOAT of Games</h2>



<p>More than a decade ago, gamers worldwide were left confused by the arrival of Goat Simulator, a game where you played… As a goat. It was a satirical, parody-ridden game that has since spawned two follow-up titles and a couple of spin-offs, and the entire series is not to be taken too seriously.</p>



<p>It was just revealed that Goat Simulator: Remastered will be released on November 7, so it’s not all that long before gamers everywhere can relive experiences they might have had more than ten years ago.</p>



<p>When you secure your copy of Goat Simulator: Remastered, you’ll also be getting a range of expansions:</p>



<ul>
<li>GoatVille</li>



<li>Goat City Bay</li>



<li>Goat MMO</li>



<li>Goat Z</li>



<li>Payday</li>



<li>Waste of Space</li>



<li>Buck to School</li>
</ul>



<p>Coffee Stain said in a recent press release: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve waited 10 years, now we ask that you wait just one more month. Goat Simulator: Remastered is going to knock your socks (hooves?) off, and we promise it’ll probably be worth the wait. We’re so excited to see what our fans think!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Goat Simulator is unbridled entertainment at its finest. While in control of a bizarre-looking goat, you can explore a sandbox environment, wreaking havoc on a local town and everyone who lives there. From licking stuff to using your impressive goat strength to headbutt cars, there’s no end to what you can achieve in Goat Simulator.</p>



<p>Seriously, it’s a hilarious game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">BioWare has detailed the five designed difficulty modes for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and no, they aren't named traditionally as easy, normal, and hard. Additionally, the RPG will offer up an Unbound option that lets players craft their own difficulty setting.</p><p dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accessibility spotlight journal</a> for Dragon Age: The Veilguard explained that players can choose from five curated difficulties during character creation: Storyteller, Keeper, Adventurer, Underdog, and Nightmare. Storyteller lives up to its namesake, as it focuses on seamlessly delivering the game's story rather than challenging combat, while there's no going back from Nightmare unless a new game is started. Keeper is intriguing because it's about "party composition and equipment choices over reaction times." Meanwhile, Adventurer means getting a handle on all three. Last but not least, Underdog seems to equate to a traditional hard mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Unbound is where players can go to tinker with everything to create their personal difficulty mode. However, BioWare recommends one of the five settings above for first-time players in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The developer also notes that there are combat options to tinker with even after choosing difficulty. For example, enemy aggressiveness and aim assist can be altered in the RPG.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1845119705" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
