<p>You'll find a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>· Explore a beautiful hand drawn watercolor world<br>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/thief-vr-review/</link>
            <guid>1383322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Thief is a series that I’ve always I loved as an idea, but lack the patience to play properly. They’re the kind of game where if you’re spotted by just one guard you are in a bit of trouble, and will likely be reloading a save if there are more than that. It’s the kind of hardcore stealth experience that encourages ghost runs whilst also hoovering up every last valuable you can find on the way. Thief VR isn’t that, really, but it is still pretty good. And it’s also incredibly immersive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvLlHUUmP9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thief VR casts you as the wanted thief Magpie, completing jobs for your handler Cassandra. The voice acting for all the main parts is great, particularly Cassandra and returning classic Thief protagonist Garret, who quickly becomes a magical voice in your head. The story isn’t going to be the biggest draw here – it’s a touch predictable and some of the dialogue is poor – but it does its job well enough, giving you a variety of things to steal and a vague reason for doing it.</p>


<p>What this game nails is how you move through its levels. You grab a window and slide it open, grab the ledge and climb through, crouch and then walk over to a chest and pull out your lockpicks. It might not sound like much, but this sequence of actions can vary wildly between VR games. Thief VR just manages to make all of this feel slick and intuitive. The locomotion here is unobtrusive enough that just climbing through a window, peaking through a door, listening to a nearby pair of guards chatting feels incredibly immersive and natural.</p>


<p>The levels looks pretty good as well. They’re not the best visuals I’ve seen in VR, but certainly aren’t the worst either. I occasionally stopped to have a look at some of the views, which is a good sign. You will find some poor textures, especially if you stop and look at the foliage as I did exactly once, and the characters all look a bit odd. Even a main character like Cassandra feels a bit like a waxwork model come to life, though she specifically fares a little better than some characters in other games I could mention. Whilst it won’t blow your mind by any stretch of the imagination, the game looks good enough to be immersive.</p>
<p>But then there are the immersion breakers, and they’re everywhere. Locomotion is great, but opening drawers is a nightmare. Grabbing a drawer, you open it towards you, let go and… it slams shut again because your hand, which you didn’t move, caught it slightly. You open it again and the loot inside is jittering about and jerking side to side slightly. You collect the loot and try to close the drawer, but it bounces open again despite you being incredibly careful. In the worst case scenario, the loot is clipping through the bottom of the drawer, causing the drawer to either be stuck frozen in space or randomly opening and closing slightly, whilst also stopping you from collecting the loot because it’s stuck inside the wood. Each drawer is usually part of a cabinet that has one to three more drawers on it. It’s difficult to feel like a thief when it looks a lot like you’ve never encountered drawers before and are acting like my nan trying to work a computer.</p>

<p>This situation is a microcosm of Thief VR where smaller details break through the great work done elsewhere. Climbing up walls, you can actually grab empty space next to a handhold to keep climbing. If you use a horizontal rope to make your way over a gap, the angles that your in-game wrists stick out at are ridiculous. Sneak up behind a guard, bonk him on the head with your truncheon and he stops to draw his sword before falling to his knees. For everything Thief VR does right there is something else that dims your lantern of enjoyment, leaving you in moodily lit awkwardness.</p>
<p>If you can ignore the constant immersion breakers there is a pretty good thief game here, but that’s home brand thief, not Thief the series. The light gem on your hand is binary now, visible or practically invisible, where being lit just means “You are standing in the light, fool!”, which makes getting close to enemies without being spotted rather easy. You quickly get a bow with all the requisite arrows – water, fire, bludgeoning, rope, and those boring pointy ones that don’t do anything special – and your trusty truncheon hangs from your hip so you can sneak up on a guard and bonk them on the head once or twice, depending on whether they’re wearing a helmet.</p>

<p>The guard AI is, frankly, abysmal when it’s working, and then sometimes just breaks. A guard walked within a few feet of me while I was knocking out another guard and didn’t notice, but then another guard heard me doing the same one room over.&nbsp;You can hit guards in the legs to bring them down to their knees – handy to knock them out whilst crouching – but sometimes it doesn’t work and they still get their swords out before falling. You can turn the difficulty up, removing assists, but the AI is so poor it still isn’t the challenge it should be. Sometimes, when a guard spots you, he freezes in place, not approaching, attacking, or even speaking.</p>
<p>Upgrading your skills and gear doesn’t rely on the money you earn from stealing, but rather on rewards from Cassandra for stealing a certain amount and snagging a relic. These are upgrades like moving quicker whilst crouched (which is absolutely essential, obviously), making less noise when sprinting or landing, or starting a mission with two water arrows. That’s a big one, since you can’t buy more water arrows and have to instead find them lying around in levels, which is just three layers of silliness.</p>
<p>All that said, I have found that stealth in VR has made me far more patient than in non-VR games because I’m so much more immersed. I’m not staring at a screen waiting, I’m pressed up against the actual wall myself. The moments where you encounter a tolerable amount of quirks, meticulously sneak into a building, steal your prize, and get away without a sound are still very enjoyable. There are one or two good moments in the story as well, even if it isn’t overly impressive overall – I particularly enjoyed losing my equipment and having to reclaim it whilst escaping from a prison, which is an overused trope, but made it marginally more challenging and enjoyable.</p>

			<p>Although it was only a CGI trailer featuring no gameplay, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the reveal of Larian Studios' Divinity</strong></a> was undoubtedly among the highlights of this year's The Game Awards, and for good reason, as the game is set to be even bigger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>It is not only the promise of a much bigger game that has got fans excited about Larian's next game. In true studio fashion, the reveal trailer held nothing back regarding dark and mature themes, and not to shock players, but to treat them with a level of intellectual respect, according to a studio representative.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on X, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Publishing director Michael Douse</a></strong> commented on the trailer's emphasis on dark themes, saying that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect"</em> came up a lot during planning. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It isn't about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The phrase "treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect" came up a lot in planning. It is about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This commitment to intellectual respect isn't surprising, considering how Larian has approached player agency in the past. Playing the "evil" or morally complex path in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong></a> is often designed to be just as interesting and nuanced as the selfless hero route. It is great to hear that the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't changed the studio's approach in creating three-dimensional worlds and stories that don't need to be sanitized to appeal to a wider range of players.</p>



<p>Divinity will mark Larian Studios' return to the franchise after Divinity: Original Sin 2, which launched in 2017 on PC and consoles. Despite the studio's long history with the franchise, the new game will mark <em>"the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before,"</em> and the <em>"Divinity we’ve always wanted to make,"</em> according to Larian CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

              <p>We can officially consider it to be last-minute holiday shopping season now, and that’s when some truly epic deals sneak up on you. Here’s one of the best ones from the audio department at Amazon — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">the top-rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are a limited-time steal at just $170</a>. These are among the very best wireless headphones for Active Noise Cancellation, and it goes without saying that the sound quality is absolutely peak, because they’re from Bose.</p>
<p>The Bose QC wireless headphones are backed by more than just the Bose name. They have over 15,000 Amazon reviews that clock in at an average of 4.5 stars, among the very best in the category. That elite-level Active Noise Cancellation, deep bass, and 24 hours of playtime on a single USB-C charge are big reasons for that lofty rating, but they’re hardly the only ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Amazingly Customizable</h2>
<p>The Bose app isn’t just a good way to work the controls on the QuietControl headphones. It’s also where you can find the Adjustable EQ that lets you play producer and take the controls to fine-tune your favorite music. Make tiny tweaks to the bass, treble, and mid-range to suit your personal tastes, and then save the settings to your profile. The Bose app is also the route to the latest firmware updates so you can ensure your QC headphones have all of the latest features and tech.</p>
<p>Some of that recent tech that makes the Bose QuietControl wireless headphoes such a great buy at half price at Amazon? How about multipoint Bluetooth connectivity so you don’t have to go through the disconnect-reconnect toggle every time you want to switch your headphones from your laptop to your smartphone or other device. There’s also the Aware Mode that works hand in hand with the legendarily good Quiet mode — switching to Aware mode keeps your sound at pro levels while reducing the level of noise cancellation to allow enough sound in for safety or conversations.</p>



<h2>Listen All Day Long</h2>
<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphone have a literal full-day battery life on a single USB-C charge — up to 24 hours so you can listen to your music, podcasts, or audio books as long as you like. If you forget to recharge them and find the battery level is low or even dead, a 15-minute quick charge will give you a 2.5-hour boost. Those lengthy listening sessions are also exceptionally comfortable, thanks to the exceptionally plush ear cushions and lightweight construction of the Bose QuietComfort headphones.</p>
<p>Of the 11 different color models of the Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones, only three are priced this low during this Amazon deal (Moonlight Grey, Pink, and Sandstone), so be sure you’re clicking the right one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">And do it quickly, because this $170 deal on a pro-level set of Bose wireless headphones is going, and going fast.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>S-GAME is looking to deliver its A-game with Phantom Blade Zero. The hack ‘n’ slasher looks slick and quick, and will be the action game to watch out for in 2026. PS5 gamers are eyeing it up, but it might not stay this way forever.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-trailer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero release date</a> was finally revealed at The Game Awards 2025. It’s going to add to an incredibly stacked year of gaming, and the pre-release hype is already big. Early marketing has made it clear it will launch on PS5—and PC—and not Xbox. Yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-could-release-on-xbox">Phantom Blade Zero Could Release On Xbox</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s always an asterisk. Credit to S-GAME</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s amazing how often little details are picked up on by players days after a new trailer or announcement. The Game Awards 2025 is well behind us, but only now is it apparent that Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date trailer had new information in plain sight.</p>







<p>At the very end of the four-minute trailer, a big blue screen pops up with an interesting message: “PlayStation 5 Console Exclusive.”</p>



<p>This was already known. However, as you should with all contracts, if you read the fine print, there’s more than meets the eye:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also available on PC. Not available on other consoles until at least 12 months after the release date.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Simply, this means Phantom Blade Zero is a timed exclusive. Like Silent Hill 2 or Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Remake games, it will launch on PS5 first (on consoles), and then we could easily see an Xbox port later down the line.</p>



<p>More than likely, this is what will happen. The console wars are over, and it seems to be about maximizing profits for Sony and Microsoft. It will get to the point where pretty much every game is on every other console—apart from Nintendo, don’t expect Mario on PS5 anytime soon!</p>



<p>Here’s the full Phantom Blade Zero trailer from TGA 2025.</p>

<p>Will Phantom Blade Zero be a day-one buy on PS5 or PC? Or does this revelation give you enough hope to hang on for a possible Xbox port later down the road?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/</link>
            <guid>1383295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, we have seen various performance improvements promised in patch notes, only to find that these improvements were so minor that they made no difference. Given <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">the long-standing performance issues in Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong>, there is obvious skepticism surrounding the <em>"over 100 performance improvements" </em>arriving <a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><strong>tomorrow with Title Update 4. </strong></a>Fortunately, fresh comparison videos released directly by CAPCOM confirm that these optimization steps are significant.</p>



<p>The two comparison videos, which can be watched below, compare performance between Title Update 3 and Title Update 4 in three fights against Arkveld, Xu Wu, and Lagiacrus on the recommended system configurations listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/"><strong>Steam</strong></a>:</p>



<p><strong>First Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>



<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *AMD FSR: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Second Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-10400</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (VRAM 8GB)</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *NVIDIA DLSS: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p>On both system configurations, all three scenarios see noticeable performance improvements. In the fight against Arkveld, the first configuration increases from an average of roughly 40 FPS in Title Update 3 to approximately 50 FPS in Title Update 4, with the second configuration experiencing similar performance improvements. Although the improvements in average FPS are promising already, performance stability also seems to have been improved, which should make the experience more enjoyable for all PC players.</p>

<p>The performance improvements of Title Update 4 are only the beginning, as Monster Hunter Wilds is set to get more enhancements in January and February, when the game's final Title Update will launch on all formats, coinciding with the game's first anniversary.  Hopefully, all the performance improvements and additional content will be enough for lapsed players to return, which is something <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>the producer wishes for</strong></a> and the game definitely deserves, as I highlighted in my launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a></strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-m4-macbook-air-joins-the-holiday-price-war-at-an-all-time-low-to-compete-with-windows-pc-deals-2000653263</link>
            <guid>1383286</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s willingness to cut huge deals on their newest tech gear has been one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the 2025 holiday shopping season. It’s still not too late to cash in on this surprising new trend, if this latest Amazon deal is any indication. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is still just $749 at Amazon, its lowest price ever and a big $250 step down from its usual $999.</a></p>
<p>The M4 MacBooks are one of the best places to look for amazing deals since being supplanted at the top of the Apple ecosystem by the M5 chip last October. But the price drops on the M4 models go way beyond the step down from the M5 to the M4, because the M4 machines are still absolutely elite-level computers, loaded with Apple Intelligence, Apple’s industry-best Liquid Retina display, outstanding cameras and speakers, and enough memory and power for heavy-duty creative work.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Small Step Down</h2>
<p>The talk in techworld has been all about the M5 MacBooks since they debuted in October, and rightfully so. The M5 machines are industry-best laptops, so when we see a huge deal on an M4 model like this one, the question becomes, just how big is the difference? The M5 chip is a faster CPU by up to 20% and faster in terms of AI thanks to new integrated Neural Accelerators. Big numbers to be sure, but how noticeable to the everyday user? Answer: Not very, unless you’re completely immersed in exceptionally heavy AI work, and even then it’s an incremental difference.</p>
<p>So while there may be an M5 MacBook Air coming in the early months of 2026, it’s a fairly safe bet that the resulting price drop on this M4 model won’t go any lower than this Amazon deal for $749, and the performance difference won’t come near meeting the price difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The time to grab the M4 MacBook Air is now, during this last-minute holiday sale at Amazon.</a></p>



<h2>All the Bells, All the Whistles</h2>
<p>It’s been less than a year since the M4 MacBook Air dropped, so it has all of the perks and tech that make the MacBooks so coveted. The M4 chip itself has a 10-core CPU and up to 10 cores of GPU, with 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD. It’s the ideal machine for photo and video editing and other content creation-related tasks. The 12MP Center Stage camera, four built-in speakers with Spatial Audio, and studio-quality mics make the MacBook Air the perfect video conferencing or video call laptop, along with its slim, lightweight design.</p>
<p>We’ve all been so used to a $749 MacBook either being 2 or 3 generations old or having the words “refurbished” or “scratch and dent” attached to the deal that the idea of that price being on a brand-new 2025 model is a little surreal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">But this Amazon deal taking $250 off of this 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the real deal, and it’s real close to being real gone.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>Nothing spreads the festive cheer quite like spooky things, right? Well, ok, I can think of a few other things that are probably higher up the festive list, but for Megabonk fans, spooky is what's on the cards.</p>
<p>Megabonk's "Spooky Update" was initially meant to arrive on a smaller scale around Hallowe'en, but solo developer Vedinad decided they wanted "to make it bigger", and as things grew, naturally so did the work involved. Anyway, while later than first intended, the spooky update for Megabonk is now here.</p>
<p>As for what it includes, along with some general bug fixes such as the Giant Fork's Megacrit not working as intended, this update also adds new items, a new character and a new map.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Megabonk's Spooky Update, as shared by Vedinad, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Map</li>
<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1 percent Poison Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now loses about 25 percent, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6 percent</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200 percent faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1 percent -&gt; 0.75 percent, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2 percent -&gt; 1.5 percent</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The action roguelike Megabonk recently made headlines after Vedinad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">withdrew from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game</a>. Vedinad admitted Megabonk was not in fact their debut game, as they had already been making games under different studio names for several years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Winter Wildcards has been expected to make its return to EA FC 26 for weeks, but new leaks now suggest the festive promo is officially next in line. Set to begin on Friday, December 19 at the usual 6 PM UK time, this year’s edition is shaping up to be the biggest Winter Wildcards event the series has ever seen.</p>



<p>And for once, it’s not just the player list doing the rounds. The leaks for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a> have been unusually broad, hinting at everything from significant new card upgrades to multiple versions of the same players with differing positions and stat tweaks. With so much information surfacing early, anticipation for this year’s Winter Wildcards is building fast—if the leaks hold true, you’re in for a truly wild festive promo.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Some big Icons will be getting major upgrades. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/FutSheriff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FUT Sheriff on X</a>, a flood of new details has emerged about the upcoming Winter Wildcards promo in EA FC 26—and there’s plenty to get excited about. The standout reveal is the suggestion that three full promo teams are on the way. With EA recently sticking to rapid-fire, one-week promos, a longer, more substantial festive event would be a welcome change and give players something meatier to dig into over the holiday period.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨WINTER WILDCARDS INFORMATION 🎄🎅🥶</p><p>• ✅ 3x Promo Teams<br>• 👶 Baby &amp; Prime Icons<br>• ⚡️ ONLY 1 PS+ <br>• 🔥 DAILY PLAYER SBC’S 💣 <br>• 👀 Some normal players also have 2x versions <br>• 👑 Best Of in packs<br>• ➕ More 👀💣🔜</p><p>Thoughts on Power Curve? Only one PS+ 🥶</p><p>Follow… <a href="https://t.co/57OBPVR8bo">pic.twitter.com/57OBPVR8bo</a></p></div>— Fut Sheriff (@FutSheriff) <a href="https://twitter.com/FutSheriff/status/1999883932926435378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But that’s far from the only headline. Another major leak claims that a select group of Winter Wildcards cards will become the first items in EA FC 26 to receive <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-breaks-ea-fc-26-trend-with-game-changing-playstyle-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStyles+</a>, marking a significant shift in the game’s power structure. It appears EA is experimenting with gradually introducing higher-tier cards without abruptly breaking their slower power-curve philosophy—and double PlayStyles+ could be their first step in that direction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for player names, the leaks are coming thick and fast. Icons like Zidane, Ibrahimović, and Ronaldinho have already been mentioned, and more are expected as we get closer to launch. If you want to stay on top of every new Winter Wildcards leak, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-promo-team-1-in-ea-fc-26-ultimate-team-leaked-players-start-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a> will be updating fans with all the latest information as it drops.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has stated his latest game, To a T, "didn't sell well" and "wasn't a good fit", expressing the difficulties of releasing more experimental games.</p>
<p>Takahashi is best known for the surreal Katamari Damacy series, which sees players rolling a ball around environments collecting increasingly bigger objects. Takahashi left publisher Namco in 2010 and has since lived in Vancouver and San Francisco while working on other projects.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Games Radar</a>, Takahashi revealed he doesn't own the Katamari Damacy IP (with Namco continuing the series itself). What's more, he's now had to move back to Japan due to To a T's lack of success.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone tries to make a niche game," said Takahashi of his output. "The title 'niche game' is just a result. I know my games are far from mainstream.</p>
<p>"I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do was because To a T didn't sell well. This is a risk of being independent, and I'm willing to take it, but I don't think it's a question of niche or traditional, it's a question of whether people like it or not."</p>
<p>Takahashi believes there's "still room for new ideas", but "unfortunately To a T just wasn't a good fit".</p>
<p>Published by Annapurna and developed by his own studio Uvula, To a T follows a young child who's stuck in a T pose. It's full of joy and humour, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">also a game about living with a disability</a>.</p>
<p>Takahashi told Games Radar he was inspired by the "downer mood/vibes/atmosphere of the place where we live" and so wanted to "make something very positive and silly".</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, but it's definitely getting harder for me," he said, when asked about the difficulties of releasing experimental games. "If anyone wants to invest in a Uvula, let me know. Let's make more fun and weird games!"</p>
<p>"What ultimately worked for me about To a T, about this frustrating, bewildering, clumsy and ingenious game - and I see this in glimpses, and in little starbursts of my own triggered memories - is its abiding sense of just how luridly weird life is when you're young, how boundless and loosely-ruled it seems," wrote Christian Donlan for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Eurogamer about understanding the core of To a T</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Christmas is that wonderful time of year where everyone waits for a man covered in a bed sheet to come down their chimney and put some presents by the carved pumpkins, and 3D bullet heaven <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a> is getting right into the spirit of things with a new Spooky Update that’s out now!</p>
<p>Well, OK, so this was actually intended to be a more timely Halloween update developer vedinad says, “but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than i initially planned. anyway hope you like it!”</p>


<p>So that means there’s a new map, new character, new weapon, items, enemies and bosses and all of that on top of the bug fixes and new settings. Seems a pretty hefty update, which does actually tie in with the Christmas gift-giving spirit this time of year. Nice!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Megabonk Spooky Update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map<wbr></li>
<li>New Character<wbr></li>
<li>New Weapon<wbr></li>
<li>New Items<wbr></li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses<wbr></li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game<wbr></p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork’s Megacrit didn’t work<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a “bug” where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.<wbr><wbr></li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings – Will enable certain settings that most players don’t need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.<wbr></li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won’t be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the “caveman” bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn’t be able to spawn close to you or reach you<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won’t be OP<wbr></li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile<wbr></li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.<wbr></li>
<li>Calcium’s passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%<wbr></li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It’s to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you’re veeeryy late game.<wbr></li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16<wbr></li>
<li>Dragon’s Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4<wbr></li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn’t make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet<wbr></li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>You can press F10 to open the console<wbr></li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something<wbr></li>
<li>Type “help” in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[‘NO LAW Is A Lot More Intimate Than Cyberpunk 2077’, Says Creative Director]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-law-is-a-lot-more-intimate-than-cyberpunk-2077-says-creative-director/</link>
            <guid>1383244</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When NO LAW was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at The Game Awards 2025, it was hard not to draw a comparison with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The new project from Neon Giant, the studio behind The Ascent, is also set in a cyberpunk city, and it's a single player first-person open world shooter RPG, much like the more famous game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-celebrates-5th-anniversary-heavy-dsicount-new-trading-card-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently celebrated its fifth anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>In the first post-reveal interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-of-no-law-know-everyone-will-compare-it-to-cyberpunk-2077-but-there-are-important-differences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Neon Giant Co-Founder and Creative Director Tor Frick acknowledged the comparison but also explained why NO LAW is going to be a lot different from Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p><em>I think obviously every day we have to do that internally as well. Because we know what Cyberpunk is and we know people will compare us. But the game is very different and the world is very different. A lot of it is, it's just the mood and the tone. Cyberpunk is a big, sprawling experience. It's a mega city. And our game is a lot more intimate both when it comes to the gameplay mechanics but also the world. I think as people see more of the game that will be more apparent. It's hard to do in a short trailer like that. I think you need to see and feel the game more. It is more of an intimate experience, like the world is deep but not so grand. And the same thing with mechanics and the same thing with the story. It is very, very personal and very, very reactive around you as a player, rather than being set in this grand backdrop.</em></p>



<p>The studio's other Co-Founder and Creative Director, Arcade Berg, added that NO LAW also features a slight tongue-in-cheek tone like The Ascent, in contrast to Cyberpunk 2077's far more serious vibe. Other inspirations include 80s-90s action movies, which were also a bit campy, as well as Hong Kong action scenes, and even manga and anime.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, the main character, Grey Harker, is a seasoned veteran who chooses to retire from active military service following the severe injuries sustained during his previous deployment to pursue a life of peace. He had abandoned violence in favor of caring for his plants, but eventually, trouble walked through his door all the same, a bit like in John Wick, prompting him to return and make those who had wronged him pay.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X with no set release window. It will be published by KRAFTON, which acquired Neon Giant a few years ago.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade's popularity is no secret, with the game selling exceptionally well <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">during its initial release on consoles</a> as well as its eventual port to PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">the latter breaking records among similar releases on the platform</a>. ShiftUp is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">currently working on a sequel to the game, following the <em>stellar</em> performance of the first</a>.</p><p>Goddess of Victory: Nikke is a totally different beast. A mobile-based gacha shooter, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/goddess-of-victory-nikke-hits-1bn-on-mobile-during-romantic-valentine-event/">the game surpassed $1bn in revenue earlier this year during its Valentines event</a>. It's featured crossovers from various other IPs,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc"> including Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1l7vlvw/rerun_of_the_nier_automata_x_nikke_collab/">Nier Automata</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF1PYiEqYVA">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-for-switch-2-reportedly-in-development">is also due for a Switch 2 release</a>, with the port reportedly in development. When we'll see some new big news for the series remains a mystery, but given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Stellar Blade sequel was aiming for a 2026 release according to an investor presentation</a>, it shouldn't be much longer.</p>

            <p>After starring in the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, Lara Croft actress Camilla Luddington has passed her bow and arrows to Alix Wilton Regan with a farewell post to the character.</p>
<p>Luddington made her debut as Lara Croft in 2013's reboot, which saw a young and inexperienced Lara wash up on the shores of Yamatai. The actress then reprised the role for both 2015's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<p>However, a new actress has now taken over the role of Lara for upcoming release Tomb Raider Catalyst. As announced at The Game Awards last week, Regan will play Lara Croft in Crystal Dynamics and Amazon's all-new Tomb Raider, as well as in the recently announced remake of the first game, known as Legacy of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Soon after this announcement was made, Luddington said her farewell to the character, adding she has "loved" the Tomb Raider fandom.</p>
<p>"To join the list of Lara Crofts before me was an incredible honour and she will forever be a part of me. The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSLtUFOgTVj/?igsh=bnU3bDFscmh4amxq&amp;img_index=1">Luddington wrote</a>, with an image of her time filming motion capture.</p><p>"And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots. 👏💫 So with that said-<a href="https://www.instagram.com/alixwiltonregan/"> @alixwiltonregan</a> .. if you're ever in need of a 🏹 , I know the exact spot to look for one at Croft Manor. 😉"</p>
<figure>

<p>Regan also shared a post following The Game Awards announcement, calling being revealed as Lara Croft the "absolute highlight" of her career. It has "surpassed even my wildest dreams", <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSKc_PVEX6y/?igsh=MWZmank3c2NkNGx2bw%3D%3D">Regan said</a>. "This Lara Croft just wanted to say thank you, and get excited. We are just getting started guys.</p>
<p>"We are Just. Getting. Started."</p>
<figure>

<p>Regan has had a number of other prolific roles before being cast as Lara Croft, including Aya in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, Lea in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>: Overture and Alt Cunningham in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three. She was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation">also set to portray Joanna Dark in the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot</a>. </p>
<figure>

<p>Tomb Raider Catalyst is set to take Lara over to Northern India on its release in 2027, when it will launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. As for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">due to be released next year</a>. Needless to say, I am incredibly excited about both.</p>
<p>As well as games, Amazon also has a live-action Tomb Raider TV series from Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the pipeline. Filming is expected to begin next month, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Joining Turner are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">British actor Martin Bobb-Semple in an undisclosed "major" role</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as Wallace</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited. The scripts are incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty, as we have come to expect from Ms Waller-Bridge," Weaver said last week.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/edifier-hecate-g2000-pro-gaming-speaker-review/</link>
            <guid>1383223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As you set up your brand-new glowing, pulsating RGB-heavy PC, you’ll likely realise there’s something missing: RGB-heavy speakers to light up your ears with sound! While I’m not sure of the medical or auditory accuracy of that, Edifier seem committed to the cause, with the new version of the Hecate G2000 Pro their latest stereo speaker kit, decked out with some extremely bright neon lights. If you’re into RGB, they might just be the perfect addition to your setup.</p>

<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro are, in line with the brand’s visual design language, shaped as a stretched-out hexagon, with our review unit coming with white speaker facades. Central to each of these is the speaker driver, its black surface contrasted by a silver centre emblazoned with the Hecate logo. The rear of each speaker unit is made from clear plastic, exposing the white and silver housing within, and they look smart and futuristic. They are definitely aimed at gamers though, and where you could easily see the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/edifier-qr65-desktop-active-monitor-review/">Edifier QR65</a> in a variety of different houses, these feel targeted at someone who wants a particularly flashy gaming setup.</p>


<p>There’s a range of support for different platforms, with the G2000 Pro certified for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S via USB-A, alongside Bluetooth connections, and you can also pump audio in via a 3.5mm connection, all of which means you can use them with pretty much any audio device out there. In the box, you’ll find the Hecate G2000 Pro, a power adaptor, as well as a USB-A cable and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable in the box too, so you won’t be searching around for things to complete your setup.</p>
<p>The right-hand speaker features a control panel across the top edge, with four buttons giving you access to input selection, Bluetooth pairing, volume, EQ and lighting controls. This is, as with some of their previous speakers, the weakest element, as the input selection simply works its way through a series of clicks, rather than voicing what input they’re connected to, and at various points through our testing I became very confused about why I didn’t have any output from my PC, only to find that the input had changed.</p>


<p>The G button runs you through the different EQ settings, with each represented amusingly by audio prompts, so a short musical trill means you’re in music mode, what sounds like a chugging engine is aimed at movies (I think it’s supposed to be a cinema reel turning), and a click and clunk of a gun reloading is for gaming. This all takes a little unnecessary parsing out, and I can’t help but think things would have been a lot clearer with a simple spoken instruction.</p>
<p>Once you’re in the correct mode though, the next thing to consider is lighting. You can turn this off and on via the G button, and alter the brightness and setup via the control buttons, but for the sake of ease you’ll need to download the Hecate Gaming App. As apps go, this has to be amongst the most basic I’ve seen in recent years, and it’s disappointing to find that you can only choose between six colours, or a rainbow effect that scrolls through them. If you have an orange light setup – which is what I have – you can forget matching the Hecate G2000 Pro to it, which seems very very odd.</p>
<p>The Hecate G2000 Pro redeem themselves somewhat by sounding much better than their app would suggest. There’s a heap of power here, and a pleasingly airy soundstage that adds depth and space to whatever you’re pumping through them. I’ve been checking out President’s King of Terrors EP – that’s definitely Charlie Simpson isn’t it? – and the mix of electronic and rock instrumentation sounded fantastic via the Music EQ setting, with plenty of detail and well controlled bass tones. If you don’t like how this EQ sounds, there’s no option of tweaking or changing it, so you’ll have to search out other EQ options, the availability of which will depend greatly on what platform you’ve got them attached to.</p>

<p>Shifting over to gaming, I put the bespoke EQ through its paces with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and its suitably epic Japanese-infused soundtrack, and the G2000 Pro definitely helped to immerse me even further into Naoe and Yasuke’s adventures. Dialogue was clear and carried well above the delicate audio, while the interstitial sound effects helped to round out the world further.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio sounded solid, though the Hecate G2000 Pro is only capable of dealing with the standard SBC codec, so you’re not getting lossless playback or even AAC, and there was a difference in clarity between the USB connection from my PC and the lossy Bluetooth one. That’s not surprising, but I was disappointed to find there was no higher quality codec support when Edifier have put a lot of emphasis on this with their other recent products.</p>

			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>

A release date for Early Access was not announced. <span id="more-1015200"></span></p><p>“We want to create a game that evolves thanks to those who play it,” said The Breach Studios CEO Ferran Punti in a press release. “Kickstarter and Early Access will allow us to work hand in hand with motivated, invested, and passionate players. We will carefully listen to this community, which shares our love of rich and satisfying game mechanics, to tune and perfect the experience before the console release. That is why choosing to work with Radical Theory as a strategic partner felt natural as they understand and support studios through their experience, deep expertise, and genuine transparency.”</p><p>Radical Theory CEO Luc Heninger added, “It is a real pleasure to collaborate with the team at The Breach Studios – developers who are as passionate as they are friendly and talented. <em>Westlanders</em> won us over in the first few minutes of gameplay, as the Western setting is still rarely explored in the survival-crafting genre. We have a true sandbox experience here that will allow players from all backgrounds to experiment with rich, deep mechanics. The idea is to have a blast with friends, as we want players to dive into building, fighting, and resource management in co-op as quickly as possible.”</p><div id="carousel_1015208"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Radical Theory:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Forge your legacy in the Westlands.</p><p>Survive a wild-west open-world teeming with riches and fraught with perils. Alone or with your friends, brave unforgiving landscapes and conquer the wilds from your customizable mobile base: The Wagon.</p><p>But don’t just survive; thrive. Lay the foundations for bustling outposts and settlements, recruit loyal companions, and weave a powerful economic network to tame the wilderness and build your legacy.</p><p><strong>Welcome to the Westlands</strong></p><p>“Our dream was simple. Make the trip to the Westlands and find a place to call home. A land of peace and prosperity where we could raise a place to call our own from dust. We saw it in every sun-drenched clearing, in every vast, untamed vista. But this land gives with one hand and takes with the other. After all this journey, all these perils, the outlaws came in like a storm in the dead of night, leaving only fire, ashes, and a single survivor. Me.</p><p>“Now, the dream of my companions is my mission. Their legacy, my burden. I’ll forge here our future—this place we’ll call home.”</p><p>—Westlands, unknown date, from the Survivor’s journal.</p><p><strong>A Solo and Cooperative Survival Journey in a Far West Setting</strong></p><p>Imagine the rich, atmospheric Wild West open reminiscent of The Revenant, where you craft your own story.

We set out to put a fresh spin on the now-familiar survival formula by placing it in the fantasy of the Wild West. Whether playing solo or with up to four players in cooperative play, you’ll carve out a life in a land that feels both legendary and dangerously alive. Explore, fight, gather resources, craft tools, climb skill trees, and build a network of settlements to bring prosperity to the Valley.</p><p><strong>Explore the Lands on Your Mobile Base: The Wagon</strong></p><p>Within minutes of starting the game, you’ll be repairing your wagon and setting off on the open road. The concept of a horse-drawn mobile base of operations is what truly sets our game apart. We wanted to eliminate the frustration common in traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [497 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>, where exploration is limited by small inventories and base-building comes too late. In <em>Westlanders</em>, you’ll dive straight into the Wild West aboard your own custom wagon. More than just transportation, your wagon is your home, your workshop, and your progression hub. Explore a vast, untamed world without constraints. Upgrade and expand your mobile camp with new tools and countless enhancements to conquer the wilderness.</p><p><strong>Build Outposts, Recruit Citizens, Create a Full Economy</strong></p><p>Your journey isn’t just about discovery; it’s shaped by your choices. Scout the perfect location to establish your base camp, a place where you can harness the land’s riches while living in harmony with nature.</p><p>From a humble camp, you can grow into a thriving settlement, pushing your reach further. Weave a vital economic network between your outposts to ensure they thrive. Attract and recruit other wanderers, each with unique skills and professions. Recruit the talent you need—from master craftsmen to steadfast guards—to help you forge a prosperous settlement in the wilderness.”</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Survive the Untamed Wilderness</strong> – Endure a dynamic, living open world teeming with bustling flora, fierce fauna, and intriguing inhabitants.

The lands resources are yours to harvest.”</li><li><strong>Automate Your Outposts</strong> – Streamline your operations with factory-like precision. Hire specialized workers and manage their assignments and wages to automate resource production, maximize efficiency and dominate the economic landscape.<br>Each worker will come with its own sets of perks and flaws that will make them unique and more suitable for different roles.

The road system allows you to create routes between your different bases. Hire workers to patrol the routes and haul resources from one base to another and see the valley evolve as you expand.</li><li><strong>Overcome All Dangers</strong> – Stand against relentless bandits, ferocious wild animals, and the myriad of lurking threats that seek to challenge your grasp on the Westlands. As you explore the world, the Events system will change the status quo in the territory.

We want to create memorable titles, something we would play on our own when we’re back home. It’s in our studios DNA to create experiences to share together with friends and that are inherently social in nature. To create games that awake that sense of immersion, thrill and discovery that we believe videogames convey in a unique way. It is with this spirit we’ve created <em>Westlanders</em>. We are fans of survival, exploration, crafting and management titles. We love games like <em>ARK</em>, <em><a title="Games > Valheim [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a></em>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em><a title="Games > Factorio [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a></em>, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative games</a>… and we like Westerns since we’re kids. We’ve of course played too much of <em><a title="Games > Red Dead Redemption [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> series, and we wanted to see what could happen if we combined <em>ARK</em> with the mood of <em>Red Dead</em>—this is how <em>Westlanders</em> is born.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

<p>We’re halfway through December (almost), and the festive window is rapidly drawing nearer. Before it gets here, you’ve got a couple of weeks of NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Fortunately, I’m on hand to give you the answers you need! Below, you’ll find the latest NYT Connections hints to crack today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #918:</p>



<ul>
<li>FINAL</li>



<li>BUMPER</li>



<li>QUALIFIER</li>



<li>GIANT</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>MONSTER</li>



<li>SEMI</li>



<li>TITANIC</li>



<li>DIVE</li>



<li>CELSIUS</li>



<li>DUMP</li>



<li>COLD</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>ONE HUNDRED</li>



<li>JOINT</li>



<li>SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of the stages you pass through before a champion is crowned</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Words you’d use to describe something so big it feels exaggerated</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Places you might warn a friend not to hang out in</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Different contexts where the single letter “C” takes on a specific meaning</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the ARC Raiders Cold Snap Update Coming Out?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1383184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is set to receive a major update this week, with Embark Studios pushing Cold Snap to all platforms. It’s one of the biggest updates to launch since the game was released on October 30, and it’s set to introduce new map conditions, quests, and a fresh weather system.</p>



<p>Fans are excited, but when is Cold Snap being released in ARC Raiders? Find out everything you need to know about this update below.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-cold-snap-being-released">When is Cold Snap Being Released?</h2>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on December 16th, most likely at 04:30 AM EST. While we know the update is being released on December 16th, Embark Studios has yet to confirm the specific time that the update goes live. However, if it mirrors the launch of North Line on November 13th, it’ll drop at 04:30 AM EST (09:30 AM GMT).</p>



<p>This is the most anticipated update to hit ARC Raiders since the North Line update introduced Stella Montis just over a month ago. While no new maps are being added in Cold Snap, fresh map conditions are coming to blanket the game in snow, altering the landscape.</p>



<p>The Flickering Flames event will also be added to ARC Raiders with this update. Again, not much is known about this event, but it’s widely assumed it’ll be a harsh change that causes players to take damage if they’re stranded outside in snowy conditions. It should function similarly to the other map conditions we already have, like Lush Blooms, Harvester, and Prospecting Probes.</p>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on December 16th. Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited to explore ARC Raiders in the snow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Shelter’s Largest Update Yet Comes 10 Years After Launch]]></title>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-is-still-giving-a-decade-later">Fallout Shelter is Still Giving, a Decade Later</h2>



<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>
