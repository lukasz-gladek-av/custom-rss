For $149, you are getting some of the best and most convenient earbuds out there, which are perfect for taking calls, listening to music, and so much more. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for $34.99</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225203"><div id="225203" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> was one of the most enjoyable RPGs of 2024, featuring a gorgeous remade HD-2D world and voice acting. If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99. In my opinion, the Switch has to be the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save Big on Samsung Gaming Monitors</h2></div><div id="224045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 32” Odyssey QD-OLED G8 (G80SD) Series 4K UHD Smart Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><div catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254" id="224046"><div id="224046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD) Series OLED Curved Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has two excellent Samsung gaming monitors on sale this weekend, and you can save up to $900! The first monitor we recommend is the 32" Samsung Odyssey G8, which is fitted with a QD-OLED panel and supports a refresh rate of 240Hz. This monitor is best for the richest visuals, as the OLED technology allows for true blacks. On the other hand, the Samsung G9 49" Curved OLED Gaming Monitor is a beast that will instantly transform any setup. While this monitor is normally $1899.99, you can score it for just $999.99 this weekend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman: Arkham Trilogy for $29.83</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225205"><div id="225205" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Batman Arkham Trilogy - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-games-in-order">Batman: Arkham games</a> are some of the most beloved superhero games out there, and the ability to play them on the Nintendo Switch is a treat in itself. Arkham Knight notoriously ran poorly on the Switch, but the Switch 2 has ironed out most of these issues seemingly thanks to its increased power. For $29.83, you can pick up the trilogy for under $10 a game, which is a pretty great deal considering this was a $60 release. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza Out This Week</h2></div><div catalogid="3cd545c5-1d5f-4eb7-be84-a6f92ed62e6d" id="222943"><div id="222943" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out this week, so now is the time to lock in your copy. Bananza is set to be DK's biggest adventure yet, and this time, he's joined by a young Pauline. The two are tasked with heading to the very core of the planet, where wishes are supposedly granted. If you are looking for the next big game on Nintendo Switch 2, this right here is sure to be it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost in the Shell 4K for $12.49</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225204"><div id="225204" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ghost in the Shell [4k + Blu-ray + Digital] [4K UHD]</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">1995's Ghost in the Shell is still one of the most influential anime films ever.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developer Unknown Worlds' parent company, Krafton, has issued another statement, this time confirming that an internal milestone document leaked online is authentic.</p>
<p>As Matt explained for us last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original Subnautica director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>

<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026.</p>
<p>It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>Then, just ahead of the weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">pages from an internal review document</a> also popped up online. According to the leaker, it "clearly shows the state of the development progress and why Krafton and the Subnautica team disagreed on the release schedules".</p>
<p>The document purports to show where the development of Subnautica 2 was deemed to be versus expectation at this point in the development cycle. It criticises the as-is position, saying "while the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and "falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market". It also clearly states it expects a "content volume increase of over 30 percent compared to v1.0".</p>
<p>At the bottom of the second slide, the author - which remains unknown - states: "compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications, the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap".</p>
<p>Rather than refute the leak, however, Krafton has confirmed the document is real, saying it was approving the credibility of the report because that would "minimi[se] speculation and ensur[e] accurate communication with players".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">A leak from a credible source regarding the milestone review of Subnautica 2</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Complete_Bread_4924/">u/Complete_Bread_4924</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/">Subnautica_2</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to Eurogamer. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p>
<p>"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with Krafton's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to Krafton's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</p>
<p>The statement closed with Krafton's claim that it will "continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years."</p>
<p>There has, as yet, been no formal response from the former leadership team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gearbox is about to launch Borderlands 4, a new installment in its most lucrative franchise by far. It's been six years since Borderlands 3, although there were the spin-offs fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and the forgettable adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/new-tales-from-the-borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Tales from the Borderlands</a>, both released in 2021, in between.</p>



<p>Let's recap everything we have learned about the game from the developers since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/">unveiling</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions<br></h2>



<p>In February, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Borderlands 4 would debut on September 23. However, in late April, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it forward to September 12</a>. At the time, most believed that publisher Take-Two Interactive had dictated the move due to the imminent launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, then still scheduled for Fall 2025. However, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford was quick to state that the date change <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-denies-rumor-that-borderlands-4-launching-early-has-to-do-with-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had nothing to do with GTA VI</a>, and he was proven right mere days later, when Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> GTA VI's delay to May 26, 2026. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2, although users of the latter platform will have to wait a bit more to play the game. Unlike most games nowadays, there won't be any 'early access' for those wishing to purchase more expensive editions. However, said editions do come with many perks.</p>



<p>The Standard edition is priced at $69.99. The Deluxe Edition costs $99.99 and includes the <strong>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</strong> and the <strong>Bounty Pack Bundle</strong>, which consists of the following post-launch Borderlands 4 content:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 unique areas, featuring new missions and unique bosses</li>



<li>4 Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>4 New vehicles with new cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at $129.99 and adds the following to the above:</p>



<p><strong>Ornate Order Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>4 Vault Hunter Skins</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Heads</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Bodies</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vault Hunter Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>2 new playable Vault Hunters</li>



<li>2 new Story Packs, featuring all new story and side missions</li>



<li>2 new map regions</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>New ECHO-4 cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>All editions of Borderlands 4, if pre-ordered, will provide access to the <strong>Gilded Glory Pack bundle</strong>, which consists of 1 Vault Hunter Skin, 1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin, and 1 Weapon Skin.</p>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>The franchise can be considered the original looter shooter, and this new installment will be no exception. </p>



<p>However, the setting is different from the previous titles. Long gone is the planet Pandora, which had been the focus of every game in the series except for New Tales from the Borderlands. This new entry follows directly from the ending of Borderlands 3, where Lilith uses her Siren powers to teleport the moon Elpis away (saving Pandora in the process). An unintended consequence is that Elpis's arrival in the orbit of the planet Kairos destroys the planet's protective barrier, making it visible to everyone after a very long time of staying hidden.</p>



<p>Kairos is a planet ruled through fear and oppression by a dictator named The Timekeeper. However, the uncloaking caused by the moon Elpis sparked chaos and uprisings. Players take the role of a Vault Hunter who ends up leading the resistance against The Timekeeper while, of course, seeking various alien artifacts. Borderlands 4 is also going to shift the series' trademark humor a bit. It will still be there, mostly in side content, but the main storyline will be a bit more serious than fans are used to due to the dictatorship theme.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, the game will focus heavily on shooting and looting. However, the new installment offers several enhancements. To start with, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the map is the biggest and most seamless in the franchise, allowing players to explore freely. There's a lot more verticality, too, which players will be able to exploit thanks to climbing, the grappling hook, and gliding. Other movement options include dashing, sliding, and double jumping. </p>



<p>Because of the exploration changes, the developers have opted to use a Bethesda-style compass rather than the mini-map seen in previous Borderlands games. They did not completely close the door to adding the feature post-launch if the fans really want it, though. Exploring Kairos will be spiced up by dynamic weather and events. Furthermore, players will be able to command their own vehicle to reach further destinations more quickly.</p>



<p>In terms of combat changes, Borderlands 4 introduces a new ordnance slot, which groups together grenades and heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers. These weapons can be fired or thrown until the ammo is depleted. Then, they possess cooldown timers that refill the ammo and the ability to activate again over a short timeframe. There are also new repair kits that can regenerate health or provide other benefits, such as increased elemental damage, fire rate, and movement speed.</p>



<p>At launch, Borderlands 4 will offer four playable characters to choose from:</p>



<p><strong>Vex the Siren</strong> - She had a hard life, fending for herself for her entire life. This perhaps explains her cynical and sarcastic nature, but beneath her rough exterior and general pessimism, she still believes in helping others. If helping means blasting oppressive jerks, all the better.</p>



<p><strong>Rafa the Exo-Soldier</strong> - He was born and raised in microgravity, which altered his bone density and musculature so severely that he could not survive anywhere else. However, Rafa was desperate to explore and enlisted in Tediore's military. In exchange for a tour of duty, his body was modified to fit a new exosuit. However, when it became clear that Tediore never intended to release him from service, he went on the run, planning to enjoy whatever time he has left before his Tediore Deadframe ends him for good.</p>



<p><strong>Harlowe the Gravitar</strong> - A former Maliwan combat scientist, she is driven by the need to understand how things work. This initially made her an outcast among her Traunt relatives, but she has used her intellect to bring new technology and gadgets to the battlefield as a Vault Hunter. Her brilliance is evident in everything she does, as is her enthusiasm and love for life.</p>



<p><strong>Amon the Forgeknight</strong> - He was raised in a Vault monster-worshipping cult until the Vault opened and the creature turned on everyone he loved. The only survivor of the ensuing carnage, he dedicates his life to finding and killing as many of these beasts as he possibly can. At heart, Amon is a warrior-poet who is introspective and unflinching in his duty. Despite his rugged appearance, he has a warm attitude and often shares stories and advice from his travels with his comrades.</p>



<p>At least two additional playable characters will be introduced to Borderlands 4 at some point after launch. As with previous franchise entries, the game will support cooperative gameplay for up to four players, this time with cross-play between all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Gearbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> fans that the Nintendo Switch 2 is powerful enough to run the game well.</p>



<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PC system requirements</a> aren't the most taxing we've seen for an Unreal Engine 5 game:</p>



<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br><em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br><em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p>So far, Gearbox hasn't officially partnered with AMD or NVIDIA for Borderlands 4, but that may change before launch. If it does, we'll update this article.</p>

		<p>The Witcher 3’s Blood &amp; Wine introduces players to the almost fairytale duchy of Touissant, a region of the world that owes fealty to Nilfgaard but has its own independence under the rule of Duquessa Anna Henrietta. It is a world that has rolling hills, vineyards, knights, and a beautiful castle that dominates the skyline. This too good to be true Duchy is under threat from a Beast that is targeting individuals and is putting fear into the population, especially in the city of Beauclair. However, while the story is about a beast that is sowing terror, Blood &amp; Wine can be considered a commentary on class disparity within society.</p>
<p><em>Spoiler Warning: It should go without saying, but this article contains spoilers for The Witcher 3 and its Blood &amp; Wine DLC.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine | Launch Trailer [GOG]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7YtrkeSMGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Rich and Poor in Toussaint</h2>
<p>When we as Geralt first venture into Toussaint, we do so in the company of knights giving a sense of splendour to the journey. You come across a new victim of the Beast, de la Croix, another knight and are soon on the way to be meet the Duquessa in Beauclair. The sense of splendour remains as you walk through the winding streets and steep hills of the city until you are in the company of Anna Henrietta, in royal regalia and surrounded by other rich and other influential people. They stand at the top of the societal ladder, but it also reflects in the city’s layout and further afield.</p>
<p>Beauclair Palace sits atop the hill of the city and it is the pinnacle of power and wealth in Touissant. However, as you make your way down the hill you see not everything is well in this almost unreal looking location. Go a few tiers down and you are still in a relatively wealthy part of the city with nice inns like The Pheasantry, shops that sell expensive paintings, and a master blacksmith. Keep going down the hill and you start noticing a difference where the paint isn’t so colourful, the types of establishments in the area more run down, and beggars asking for alms in the shadow of the castle. It reflects reality in that the richest cities in the world have an endemic situation of homelessness, coming from a variety of causes like unaffordable homes and unemployment.</p>


<p>In Toussaint, people who rise do so at Anna’s discretion, while others will never have such favour placed upon them. The only real employment, aside from working in stores, seems to be limited to working on the region’s vineyards which is back-breaking. It also does not seem to pay well, and we see in one quest that at least one vineyard owner does not even care that one of his workers has been killed, commenting he will just replace him with another peasant. It is an attitude the rich and powerful have in Toussaint, of seeing those not of their class as lesser and expendable. This plays in to events later in the main quest but more of that in a bit.</p>
<h2>Higher and Lower Vampires</h2>
<p>Humans are not the only society ruled and divided by class hierarchy. In Blood and Wine we get more insight into vampire society, and how this is also divided between Higher and Lower. The Higher Vampires that exist in Blood and Wine includes Regis, an ally of Geralt, and Dettlaff, who we also learn is in the Beast. Both of them are known as Higher Vampires because they employ things like reason, have deep emotions, and are capable of living in plain sight within human society. Lower vampires are those like Bruxa, Alps, Ekimmaras, and Katakans. They are represented as being more animalistic, acting on instinct rather than any sort of reason.</p>
<p>This reflect the way human society also structures itself. Those at the top would consider themselves as reasonable and intelligent, while those lower in social standing are considered less intelligent, less reasonable and prone to rashness. It is seen across representation within TV shows as well as how certain groups are portrayed within factual media like the news, with headlines and perspectives altered based on the subject’s class and background.</p>
<p>Both Regis and Dettlaff are shown to have some reason, though Dettlaff also represents what happens when those who consider themselves to be reasonable and smart collapse under the weight of strong emotions and instinct. He shows how desperate those with any sort of power, possession, or even love will go to hold on to that, and what they will unleash if they are wronged with consequences felt by those with no say in the matter.</p>

<h2>The Vampire Attack on Beauclair</h2>
<p>The events of Blood and Wine culminate in an attack on the city of Beauclair with Dettlaff and Anna Henrietta at war. This is a war between two of the most powerful individuals of their respective societies, because neither gets what they truly want. Dettlaff wanted Syanna, his former lover and Anna’s sister, to come meet him to get some closure on the whole thing. Anna instead locked her sister in a tower, leading to a massacre.</p>
<p>On both sides, we see a lack of care and compassion for the lower classes. Anna will still not agree to anything that would jeopardise her sister or even her power. From Regis we learn lower vampires do not usually follow the will of higher vampires, but Dettlaff has compelled them to attack Beauclair. What this represents is the ruling and political classes forcing the poorer classes of their societies to engage in violence with each other, while the rulers stay hidden and behind layers of safety to protect them from the violence they have commanded to be unleashed. The vampires attack is primarily focused on the lower districts of Beauclair, with a couple of attacks on the main castle, so the majority of people killed are from the lower and middle classes with the higher classes relatively unscathed. &nbsp;This is war the world over. Political classes from across the globe make demands of each other and when they are not met, wars are declared with the majority of the suffering being bared by those who had no say in any of the decision making, left to pick up the pieces as their lives are shattered.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine is not just a story about a vampire killing certain targets in a fanciful society, it is a commentary on class and social disparity. It exposes myths of power and reason being the sole purview of the higher classes, but it also shows how the actions of the most powerful in society can have a devastating effect on the lower classes.</p>
<p>The attack on Beauclair shows the lower classes of both human and vampire society thrown into the meat grinder. Class and social disparity will not be solved overnight and we will likely go through many more generations before there is a re-evaluation on societal structures, but it is important to be aware of these issues and try to contribute to improving society no matter how small your contribution.</p>

<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f75f64ff116d8/magical-quest-3-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Looking back at last week, we checked out Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64, pitting North America and Europe against Japan. It wasn't even close either, with the western design winning with a resounding 89% of the vote. 89%! We quite like the Japanese design too...</p>
<p>This week, we're looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/disneys_magical_quest_3_starring_mickey_and_donald">Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey And Donald</a> for the GBA. Why? Because that's the one I found first, okay? Released in 2005, it was a port of the original 1995 SNES version and received fairly middling reviews, with most finding it to be a lesser game than its predecessors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97ftohwum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But let's cut to the chase. It's a full blown brawl this week with three combatants. So let's get cracking!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9399360f08982/magical-quest-3-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe and Japan share similarities this week, but it's North America that went down a different route with its approach. It's still got Mickey and Donald front and centre, but they're chilling out in a forest area, and Mickey is all kitted out in his knight's armour. Rad.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d9879bc381f/magical-quest-3-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design seems slightly more action-packed, and Donald's wearing a different costume here too. Both characters are punching and whacking enemies, while the logo design itself is similar to North America's albeit with a dark shadow surrounding the letters.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e8c60871b7bf/magical-quest-3-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design uses the same artworks as Europe's, but you can see a bit more of it this time. We love the logo design here too, but we must admit that the yellow background is kinda gross.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/tony-hawk-reiterates-decisions-behind-song-choices-in-pro-skater-3-plus-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk-reiterates-decisions-behind-song-choices-in-pro-skater-3-4.1242429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> rolled out on multiple platforms this week, and while it's a fantastic throwback to the glory days of the series, there are obviously some differences. Apart from the changes to THPS4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">the soundtrack</a> is missing some notable classics.</p>
<p>The Birdman himself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">already explained to fans months ago</a> how he wanted to include "some different songs" – including different songs by some of the same artists.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/W_PvXRze24U">recent interview with BBC News</a>, he reiterated how this decision was apparently about introducing players to new music they might not have heard before. He also reminded fans how he's not the only one who makes the calls about the game's soundtrack – acknowledging the team's input, but he did manage to get at least some of his picks in the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tony Hawk:</strong> "These days, just what I think fits, and what I'm interested in – I'm not the only decider in these soundtracks, but I did manage to throw a couple of bands in... I also picked songs by artists that were already in the game, but a different song, and not everyone agreed with that decision, but I feel like 'let's keep it fresh' and also 'here's help discovering other music', and I think in the beginning that's what people expected of it – once the soundtrack was a prominent part of the game, people were like 'ok' what are you going to throw at us now?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest comments about the game's soundtrack also respond to a question about why <a href="https://youtu.be/-NPLYBIwjjg">Alien Ant Farm's song 'Wish'</a> was excluded from the latest release – with the reason, supposedly, once again tied to the concept of making room for "new acts and new songs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wasn't zeroing in on them per say, it was more we're trying to make room for new acts and new songs as well, and not everything makes the cut, it's nothing personal, and I appreciate that people have a fondness for that song [Wish], especially in relation to our game, so you know, just fire it up on your streaming service if you're so inclined."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> adopted a similar approach with the soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/au/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-new-skaters">the character roster in the latest game</a> follows the same format (like the previous game) – mixing legends and new pro talent. Tony touched on this in the same interview, along with the selection process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was trying to keep it modern obviously, whilst still respecting the legends that we had in the previous games, and also it was a matter of who was still actively skating, who was still in the scene. It's a delicate balance, but I'm really excited to have people like Chloe Covell, to have Rayssa from Brazil, and Andy Anderson."</p>

			<p>Nintendo is about to launch the second big first-party exclusive Switch 2 game: Donkey Kong Bananza. Earlier this week, the development team confirmed that Donkey Kong Bananza started development on the original Switch just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. </p>



<p>Why did they make it an exclusive, though, rather than a cross-generation title? Here's an answer provided by Nintendo EPD Game Director Kazuya Takahashi in an interview with Spanish website <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Lavanguardia</a>:</p>



<p><em>As we mentioned before, we wanted to create continuity through the chain of destruction, and to achieve this, we needed to include a large number of destructible objects. This was only possible on Nintendo Switch 2, which allowed for the placement of so many elements on screen, as well as various materials and large-scale destruction. Additionally, to enhance the sense of satisfaction of destruction, we put a lot of effort into the effects and sounds, as well as the appearance of the objects being destroyed.</em></p>



<p>The interviewer pointed out that, after going hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza, it looked like there were some frame rate issues in the preview build. Here's what Takahashi had to say about that:</p>



<p><em>There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We're aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.</em></p>



<p>It doesn't sound like they are at all worried about it. We'll know more about the severity of the performance problems and indeed about the game as a whole next week, given that Nintendo is launching Donkey Kong Bananza on Thursday, July 17.</p>



<p>Look forward to our review when the embargo drops. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our hands-on preview</a>.</p>

<p>Cracking down on piracy</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38585bf10eedc/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, a major Switch ROM site known as 'nsw2u' was seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an official statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, highlighting the other sites seized. Here it is in full (via the official FBI website):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FBI Atlanta Seizes Major Video Game Piracy Websites</strong></p>
<div><p>The FBI's Atlanta Field Office announced today the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces providing pirated versions of popular video games.</p><p>

In addition to the seizure, the FBI has dismantled the infrastructure of these websites.</p><p>

For more than four years, the websites contained pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date.</p><p>

Between February 28, 2025, and May 28, 2025, records indicate a total of 3.2 million downloads occurred on these sites from the most used download service. These actions resulting in an estimated loss of $170 million.</p><p>

As part of the actions announced today, the FBI has obtained authorization to seize the domain of multiple sites, to include nsw2u.com, nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com. These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games. Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities.</p></div></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pnhlzi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's director Kazuya Takahashi has now reportedly acknowledged these issues in a chat with the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Spanish outlet Lavanguardia</a> – seemingly confirming these frame rate drops will be in the final build during more destructive moments of the game. For Nintendo, it was instead apparently about prioritising "fun and playability".</p>
<p>Here's Takahashi's full response (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-frame-rate-drops-director/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8ulojrz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although there will be some slight drops, as Takahashi mentions, the "overall" experience is still smooth.</p>
<p>In our recent preview of Donkey Kong Bananza, we noted how the experience in this new release felt a bit like a "TOTK situation" where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition. So, if you're jumping into DK's new adventure on release and encounter changes in performance, don't be surprised.</p>
<p>We'll deliver our full review for Donkey Kong Bananza next week, so you can find out then how the final build performs.</p>

<p>Latency, performance and resolution investigated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>GameCube has joined the Switch 2's library of classic games, and it was recently updated with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. While the service's experience has been fun so far, there have also been some reports of underlying issues with the emulation.</p>
<p>Now, Digital Foundry has tested GameCube emulation and backward compatibility – investigating latency, analogue stick issues, frame drop issues on Switch 2, and resolution and performance improvements. The verdict is "certain details clearly need attending to by Nintendo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For arcade-perfect accuracy in the likes of F-Zero GX, the extra input latency on Switch 2 should ideally be addressed, and likewise the sensitivity of those analogue sticks, the pattern of single frame drops in all games is also an obvious blemish but fundamentally the four games released on the GameCube classics page so far are faithfully represented."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a video from game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer about GameCube games on the Switch 2 – summing up the initial experience as "very good" but also having some "obvious" differences from the real experience.</p>
<p>To access this latest Switch Classics library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Expansion membership.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was only unveiled last week</a>, but already franchise owner Capcom is pulling back the curtain to give us our first look at the mobile strategy game.</p>
<p>Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality". A free-to-play title, Capcom reckons it will "offer a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series".</p>

In a bid to fight back, you'll meet and recruit Resident Evil characters, upgrading their skills and inventories with the now customary visits to the Merchant.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit may be set in a parallel world and explore a new storyline, but players can expect to bump into familiar faces from across the main series, too, and make up their ultimate dream team, including series stalwarts Leon Kennedy and antagonist, Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>You can also connect, and compete with, other players and set up and manage a base of operations in the guise of a mansion that long-time fans may recognise.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit is expected to release in 2025, but we don't yet have a solid date.</p>
<p>As for the other recently-announced Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Requiem? Anticipation is evidently high, as Capcom recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us have already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton]]></content:encoded>

            <p>IO Interactive has confirmed it is "addressing" Hitman: World of Assassination issues on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>While no specific time scales were provided for when players can expect an improvement to the Switch 2 launch title, the team is reportedly "working on some of those performance issues right now" and continue to do so "over the summer".</p>

<p>“So for Hitman, the team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer,” franchise director Jonathan Lacaille told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>“It's, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well – so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title."</p>
<p>While the news may not contain a specific timeframe or much detail, it should be good news nonetheless for those struggling to play the game on Nintendo's latest handheld. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lroncb/i_hate_the_switch_2_port/">Some</a> are reporting issues with interactionable objects, opening doors, and crashing, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lnz7bo/switch_2_performance/">others</a> complain of "horrible" frame dips and stuttering.</p>
<p>ICYMI, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Announced last month, the mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side, "challenging" how players approach things now they are going in as one of a pair.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/io-interactive-is-working-on-some-of-those-nintendo-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatched by the crown as part of a secret expedition to a remote island part of the realm, you're ready for a life of adventure. But in third-person RPG Of Ash and Steel you're not one of the highly-trained, well-armored holy knights trying to enforce the will of the king… you're the clever orphan-turned-cartographer along for the ride because the maps of the island, Grayshaft, are pretty bad. Perhaps they're bad because the island suffers periodic volcanic eruptions so devastating that it's blanketed in deadly ash that cakes inside your lungs and kills you, eruptions so awful that ships avoid the island for the entire year when one seems imminent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is obviously why brave cartographer Tristan has agreed to go there. And so like many fantasy protagonists, Tristan will soon be in way over his head—all because he wanted a bit of adventure—when the holy knights are all dead and he's the only one left to deliver the urgent missive. At least, that's what a hands-on preview with a beta build tutorial and first few hours of Ash and Steel told me.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks like a pretty traditional RPG, reminiscent of classics from the 2000s. It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions, but at the same time it does highlight loot on the ground or chests you can interact with when you're near them. It's somewhere between Gothic and the first Witcher game, in its own way, with a nod toward the survival-centric games of the last decade or so. While it doesn't go all-in on survival and encumbrance, Ash and Steel still has something of the 2019 RPG Outward in it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Of Ash and Steel feels like a game in the legacy of dearly departed mid-tier RPG studio Piranha Bytes, creators of the Gothic, Risen, and Elex series. That includes the signature campy acting mixed in with some decent drama, as well as plenty of oddball and unexpected humor. (One early quest has you finding the soiled trousers of a man who, when drunk, just craps himself and leaves the pants right there to clean up later.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps its most old-school feature is how it has no level scaling in its world—creatures are a fixed level in a fixed location, forever. You're warned early on that going off the path can be dangerous, and each new enemy encounter is often a question of getting close enough to see if it massively out-levels you before you decide to try and take it on or not—and hope for good loot when you do. Coupled with that lethal-but-rewarding exploration is the rudiments of a survival system, where staying fed and watered is a must to survive, and setting up shop at pre-determined campsites lets Tristan rest and cook to regain hit points and pick up buffs. It also passes time, which is useful in a world where the NPCs and monsters follow a schedule of their own as to when and where they appear, or even when they're taking a nap and won't talk to you about your very urgent quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tristan has three skill trees, and perhaps the most pressing one is Combat. Investing in combat skills lets you pick up to three different stances to fight from, each of which looks to have different effects based on what kind of weapons you're wielding—there were axes, swords, clubs, daggers, and a crossbow. Sadly, poor starter Tristan wasn't strong or competent enough to wield most of them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a big part of what I think the story developer Fire Frost is telling with Of Ash and Steel. This isn't a fantasy hero game where your character starts as competent at any useful skills relevant to his current situation. It's going to be a zero-to-hero story, with other characters in the world reacting to Tristan as he grows stronger. "If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin," said Fire Frost, "by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a hint of that in action during the preview play, as characters who previously saw Tristan dressed only in threadbare clothing later had complimentary things to say about a suit of basic armor I'd purchased. Where before they'd just asked: "Are you really wearing <em>that?"</em> they later said, "Ah, I had a sturdy suit like that when I was younger."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And a sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal. Armor will help you survive a few hits, but the stamina-based combat was really based around perfectly timed dodges and parries. Tristan's attacks, at least at the start of the game, are slow and clumsy—he's literally never fought before. As he got combat skills, though, he moved more confidently and picked up the ability to parry in a way that opened up enemies for counterattacks. That blended well with a fast knife, which let him get in those hits before quickly going back on his guard. Still, there's some tweaking to do on the early stages of the fighting—some people will definitely bounce right off of how clumsy Tristan was, or just won't be familiar with the time-honored strategy of "train the difficult enemy into a nearby powerful NPC."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of trying to survive, that's the focus of Tristan's other two skill trees: Survival and Crafting. They're much more down-to-earth, practical skillsets simply due to their nature. Survival lets you keep yourself fed and alive, while Crafting lets you upgrade and upkeep your equipment. Crafting also does one very important job: Makes you money. Quests and other odd jobs are a great source of experience and cash, sure, but paying people to train Tristan in all these new skills ain't cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was cool is that investments of money and skill points into the Craft and Survival trees actually did pay off in combat. A good craftsman can better sharpen their weapon for bonus damage, or reinforce their armor for extra defense. Survivalists, meanwhile, could pick up nasty tricks like thrown daggers and the use of poisons on their weapons—though poor preview Tristan was a bit too intellectually dull and low-level to get to try those skills out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the advantages of level and time, however, Of Ash and Steel is definitely going to be a game where you get your butt kicked. A lot. Quicksave, I expect, is Tristan's greatest friend in the world. Enemies hit hard, and enemies that are higher level than you hit extremely hard—or even so fast that poor low-level Tristan simply stood no chance of reacting in time, let alone getting a single attack in. As a result, he got splatted by a lot of things. He got mauled by a giant rat-thing. Trampled by a big bug. Eaten by a lizard-thing. Dismembered by all manner of bandits, both living and apparently undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the only dang reason Tristan didn't get splatted by this giant troll is because when everything can splat you, well, you get pretty good pretty fast at running and climbing your way out of danger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some people might find that kind of thing frustrating, Of Ash and Steel was pretty nice on that count. The action-RPG combat was somehow clunkier than a FromSoftware game but settled into its own rhythm after a while, and hopefully gets more and more fluid with more skills and abilities in the full game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect miracles from Of Ash and Steel, but the preview was evidence of a promising mid-tier RPG that'll likely enthuse ye olde genre purists while still being accessible and interesting enough to draw in lovers of more modern character-driven action.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-and-steel-is-an-old-school-rpg-with-on-the-job-training-for-fantasy-adventurers]]></content:encoded>
