<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eaea1e2008977/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all waited a whopping seven years to get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and what has been <em>the</em> talking point in the weeks following its release? The difficulty.</p>
<p>With tricky bosses, perilous platforming and some meaty runbacks, many have found Silksong to be a touch too tricky at launch — even after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-patch-will-nerf-the-difficulty-in-certain-areas">swift update</a> sought to lessen the blow of select early encounters — and now, Team Cherry has addressed the hot topic in a recent discussion at an ACMI Game Worlds exhibition in Australia (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zmolit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"Silksong has moments of steep difficulty," Team Cherry's Ari Gibson told the exhibition's co-creator Jini Maxwell, "but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you're going and what you're doing".</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson continued. "One player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes".</p>
<p>This approach makes a lot of sense. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, there <em>is</em> help to be found with Silksong's trickier moments, if you know where to look. If a boss battle or particular platforming challenge isn't working out for you, then the best idea is probably to get back to exploring for a while.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent players "getting stonewalled" by a particular challenge, Gibson stated, so the team ensured that "[players] have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely".</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6837e9297f134/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't to say that all challenges can be overcome by mere exploration alone, mind you. "Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight," Gibson said of the core changes in the sequel, "so even the base enemies had to be more complicated, more intelligent".</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of these core enemies borrowed from the original Hollow Knight to really sell the step up in challenge. "The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," revealed Team Cherry's William Pellen, "in contrast to the Knight's enemies, Hornet's enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away".</p>
<p>It's brutal and punishing at times, but that didn't stop us from having a <em>wonderful</em> time with Silksong. We called the long-awaited sequel "a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>, which you can read in full below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard not to get excited for each and every trailer shown during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest</a>. Sitting in the audience, I fall for the hype every time. Even&nbsp;several months later, I still remember my excitement when&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>was revealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>&nbsp;looked to have this anime aesthetic (one sure way to catch my attention), but I also noticed gorgeous, paint-like visuals and an outstanding score, so yeah, I just <em>knew </em>I had to review it one day. And here I am, here to tell you that&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>is indeed as good as it looks and sounds.</p>

<p>A generational <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite/games" rel="nofollow">rougelite</a> in several ways,&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>is a time-trotting adventure with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-review" rel="nofollow">Hades</a>-</em>inspired mechanics. It's up to Towa and a group of guardians to save Shinju Village from the threat of the monstrous Magaori. With enough time and effort, they might be able to end the threat by taking out the one behind all this evil: Mogatsu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-guardians.jpg?itok=y2Ek1Hvq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-guardians.jpg?itok=hAunU_uW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The heroes of our story.</figcaption></figure><h2>It's a Group Effort</h2>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>is a rich roguelite with a great deal of depth to its mechanics. Run-by-run, you'll dive into dangerous areas filled with Magaori, cleanse the area of their monstrous presence, and fight several bosses along the way. Defeat the final boss of these runs and use their mana to further your goal of ridding the land of this threat for good.</p>

<p>The aspect of gameplay<em>&nbsp;</em>that immediately captured my attention was the Tsurugi-Kagura mechanic. This is the combination of the Tsurugi, who wields two swords, and the Kagura, a staff-user. You have eight different characters to choose from, and any one of them can be the Tsurugi and Kagura.</p>

<p>This means you're given around 28 different combinations for each run. Each run, therefore, has the potential to feel quite different from the other. Throw in the hand-crafted combat arenas -- in which the order and types of enemies are randomly generated -- and <em>Towa</em>&nbsp;continues to feel fresh, even 20 hours in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-origami.jpg?itok=4R4yXALV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-origami.jpg?itok=6HfKi5Fb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choices, choices. Who will you pick?</figcaption></figure><p>Likely, you'll settle on a favorite duo for your Tsurugi-Kagura, but without spoiling the story, you will be forced to use different combinations throughout. This allows players to get a good feel for what every character has to offer, though some Tsurugi and Kagura may be a better fit for the role than others.</p>

<p>Personally, I preferred using Shigin, a ninja with boomerang-like attacks as well as a long-ranged ability. For those in the role of the Tsurugi, you're given those two swords I mentioned, and each attack is connected to a different sword. The swords have durability, but regenerate after you switch to the other sword. Because of this, you're incentivized to use different attacks rather than just spam one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kagura, meanwhile, have elemental spells. Some of these are used automatically, but you can pick and choose purchasable spells later on to customize your kit to suit your needs. They have two spells each, and they can range from being damage-dealers to being more utilitarian, granting buffs like damage negation or damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-tsurugi-kagura.jpg?itok=nOuxRj_R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-tsurugi-kagura.jpg?itok=h_GH3bBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Teamwork makes the dream work!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Power of the Tsurugi-Kagura</h2>

<p>Together, the Tsurugi and Kagura make a strong combination against the various Magaori you'll face. Magaori range in size and power, and you'll battle them in combat arenas throughout your run. Dodging around their attacks is key, since health is, of course, a precious resource. Magaori attacks are usually telegraphed since they charge up with an on-screen indicator, but combat has potential to become overwhelming depending on the enemy type.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Tsurugi has attacks that are typically charge-based. Players hold down the attack button to get an increasingly powerful attack, but charging it can sometimes leave you vulnerable. If I had to compare it to anything, it definitely feels like a nice little twist on the&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;formula, and that's evident in more ways than one.</p>

<p>After each area is cleared, you gain boons that benefit you in a multitude of ways. There are an abundance of upgrades here, all of which behave in a&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>-like fashion. Some upgrades may give you chain lightning or a whirlwind effect, some might leech mana, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-upgrades.jpg?itok=TBBat3GE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-upgrades.jpg?itok=QeNHOGIQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here is an example of upgrades you'll choose after a combat encounter.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I always preferred the upgrades that gave me a damage boost to either of my swords, though increasing spell damage with your Kagura is also important. Some upgrades are a bit more high-stakes, like increasing the Tsurugi's damage at the expense of the Kagura now having a single health point.</p>

<p>That brings up another point: Health. Yes, it's a precious resource, as is the case with any roguelite. It stands to reason that the Tsurugi and Kagura are two different beings in&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree,&nbsp;</em>independent from one another. If, say, the Kagura runs out of health, you're still good -- both can continue fighting until <em>both </em>have depleted their health.</p>

<p>While they move in unison, you can actually directly control both at the same time if you want to get fancy. I usually preferred just having them both follow each other, but I like that the option is there; alternatively, you can play local or online co-op, one player as each role, so that's also a nice option to have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-combat.jpg?itok=eCvGSp2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-combat.jpg?itok=m4ezyLi0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't get squashed by this big guy!</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking the Fight to the Magaori</h2>

<p>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>is satisfying, and the upgrades you accrue both inside and outside of runs have a tangible effect on your performance. I did find, however, that the Tsurugi with more range-based attacks had an easier time than those using melee.</p>

<p>Most enemy attacks are avoidable at a range, so it stands to reason Shigin, with his more long-ranged attacks,&nbsp; was a powerful asset. It felt much easier using him than, say, Nishiki the anthropomorphic koi fish, who jumps back and forth between enemies but is ultimately a short-ranged attacker.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-battle.jpg?itok=EUY2N8EQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-battle.jpg?itok=3zHOT3mQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My advice: Don't get hit.</figcaption></figure><p>And though I'm&nbsp;not proud to admit it,&nbsp;<em>Towa&nbsp;</em>can, at times, be easy to cheese during your runs. If I got&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;hurt during a combat encounter, I could quit to the menu and restart it at the health I had before combat began. Encounters save as you enter the room and after the last enemy is dead, so technically, you can quit right in the middle of combat and start over if things look too dicey.</p>

<p>This comes in handy during boss battles, but again, it's not something you should abuse, especially if you're looking for more of a challenge. Though there is a lower difficulty option that increases players' power after each unsuccessful run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-story-dialogue.jpg?itok=eheUHTf8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-story-dialogue.jpg?itok=d6yx041f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hot springs sound nice...</figcaption></figure><h2>A Rich Story Filled With Lore</h2>

<p>Thus far, I've only talked about gameplay, but&nbsp;<em>Towa&nbsp;</em>features an abundance of story content. The amount of dialogue might turn some players away, in which case, it's all easily skippable. I, however, fell in love with the narrative of&nbsp;<em>Towa</em>, especially with the characters in and around Shinju Village.</p>

<p><em>Towa</em>'s narrative features a great deal of alternate timelines and time skips, so the concept can be both hard to grasp and explain, even after beating it. However, that didn't deter me from enjoying the wonderful character writing that&nbsp;this title has to offer; truly, it has some of the most memorable characters in a roguelite, rivaling that of, again, genre staples like&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>.</p>

<p>The story revolves around the eight guardians and Towa, an ageless girl overseeing Shinju Village. There is an incredible amount of interactions between all eight guardians and Towa, and these come forth during periods of respite in the middle of combat runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-dialogue-interactions.jpg?itok=qr_AJrIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-dialogue-interactions.jpg?itok=L9nXjSsq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Periods of respite are rewarded with dialogue.</figcaption></figure><p>Each combination of Tsurugi and Kagura has interactions in which they play off of each other's personalities, so the narrative is an impressively complex web. Relationships and personalities shine in these interactions, and when I thought I had seen all there was for two characters, there was still more and more.</p>

<p>I learned that Mutsumi is a sister to Bampuku and multiple others in the village, and she prioritizes family over all else. There's Origami, a mysterious woman who is far, far away from her village and is so old that she sees the other guardians as children. Akazu, a scholar, has some funny interactions with most characters, as he is a bit frail and is deathly afraid of bugs -- something that most guardians are sure to bring up in their conversations with him.</p>

<p>I want to give special recognition to the all-star cast of voice actors featured in&nbsp;<em>Towa.&nbsp;</em>You have big names in the game and anime-dubbing scene like Allegra Clark, Aleks Le, and Alejandro Saab. Every voice actor gives 110 percent, and that's evident right from the start.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-village.jpg?itok=Br5G4qT7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-village.jpg?itok=hChZzieg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters are bright and colorful, with distinct personalities!</figcaption></figure><h2>Shinju Village, the Heart of&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardian of the Sacred Tree</em></h2>

<p>Then there's the village of Shinju itself, which will evolve and flourish as you progress through&nbsp;<em>Towa'</em>s story. It starts as a smaller, humble village and soon becomes a flourishing town. <em>Towa</em>'s story actually spans a generation or two, so there are quite a few time skips due to reasons pertaining to the Magaori threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, the village is a place you'll also spend a lot of time. Here, you can gain upgrades by spending ore, which will aid you in subsequent runs. In terms of narrative revolving the town's people,&nbsp;<em>Towa</em>&nbsp;absolutely grabbed my attention.</p>

<p>You'll see villagers grow old, pass on, and lead to the next generation. You'll see how the passing of their loved ones affects those who remain, and how a new generation of villagers instills hope for a brighter future. There are some seriously heartfelt stories in Shinju Village, and I reckon you'll miss the passing of some characters and feel the void they leave behind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-fishing.jpg?itok=qJZchEy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-fishing.jpg?itok=ZDfydW2_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Why, of course there's a fishing minigame in the village!</figcaption></figure><p>It's heavily encouraged to engage in dialogue with these villagers, though the writing can be wordy at times. Nonetheless, these conversations aim to develop the personalities of each villager, and they all have their own storyline as you fight across decades.</p>

<p>As an example of what I'm talking about, you'll see a large, gruff blacksmith take on a young apprentice. That apprentice, Enka, will grow older, take on a wife, and eventually have a child, all of which you'll see grow throughout your time playing. Enka and others' appearances change as they grow older, so you truly do feel the passage of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Towa</em>'s story takes place across decades, you'll come to find this is a game with incredible character development. Although you don't see every single aspect of these characters' lives, it's written in such a way that you'll come to know people like Enka very, very well.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-sword.jpg?itok=MuMQj3Gd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-sword.jpg?itok=2yPAO9Zx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I assure you, the curves are necessary.</figcaption></figure><h2>Towa's a Crafty Girl</h2>

<p>But, outside of just story, the village serves as a way to upgrade and develop your guardians, thus setting them up for success in future runs. These come in the form of using that ore I mentioned. These come from your runs and are spent in order to increase stats like attack, or purchase items that enhance characters' attributes.</p>

<p>The main thing I want to focus on is blacksmithing, which plays a vital role in your guardians' power. Since Tsurugi wields two swords, it stands to reason you'll need swords to fight, right? Well, there's an entire blacksmithing mini-game to create new and increasingly powerful swords, and it's quite impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-crafting-sword.jpg?itok=fCmj66Uc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-crafting-sword.jpg?itok=vhKxiUJ8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>But will it cut?</figcaption></figure><p>Crafting a sword is a multi-step process and goes through traditional, Japanese sword-making techniques. It starts from picking the right ore, to making said ore into a billet, shaping and then sharpening your sword, and more. Players can perform a series of QTEs to increase the stats of their sword even more, so it's an enjoyable and interactive experience.</p>

<p>I appreciated the fact that your sword is highly customizable from a cosmetic standpoint, even if it doesn't necessarily affect gameplay. You can make some whacky, curved shapes that serve no real-life practical purpose, but why not? My ultimate sword, one that was extremely powerful and allowed me to beat&nbsp;<em>Towa</em>, was named Gigachad. Never forget Gigachad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scope of&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred&nbsp;</em><em>Tree&nbsp;</em>is seriously impressive, with so many mechanics that play off of each other and feel just right. The explanation of certain mechanics and terminology can get a little confusing at times, but it's ultimately a roguelite that's easy to get lost in.</p>

<p>The art and music, by the way, are jaw-droppingly good. That's really the icing on the cake: A rock-solid, fundamentally great roguelite with an eye-catching, paint-like art style and orchestral soundtrack. I came to find out the composer for&nbsp;<em>Towa</em>&nbsp;is Hitoshi Sakimoto.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-art.jpg?itok=68G0sNpM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-ancient-tree-art.jpg?itok=u08ERMtC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My goodness, it's stunning.</figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't immediately familiar with the name, but his body of work speaks for itself, featuring games like <em>Tactics Ogre</em>, <em>Final Fantasy XII</em>, <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, and much, much more. With his expertise, the emotional moments in <em>Towa&nbsp;</em>hit hard, and the sequences of intense action against bosses get the adrenaline pumping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I often have the luxury of picking and choosing what games I want to review, so I tend to gravitate toward games that interest me -- obviously, right? I knew I'd probably like<em>&nbsp;Towa and the Guardian of the Sacred Tree</em>, but I didn't know I'd like it as much as I did. Really, it's the characters, the stellar vocal performances of its voice actors, and the story that sell it. But the fact that it's an addictive, and competent roguelite to boot, assured that I was captivated from start to finish.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Towa and the Guardians of the Ancient Tree</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 22 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Our lives are dominated by long cables and fat adapters, invading our spaces creating unwanted clutter. Just about everything has a battery in it these days and requires daily charging. Your phone? Gotta plug it in. Your headphones? They used to just work, but now they’re Bluetooth so plug it in. Your watch? My old watch that just told time didn’t need it’s battery replaced for years. Now my Apple Watch needs to sit back in it’s wireless charger before I go to bed every night. Too many things need charging which means our desktops and nightstands are a tangled nightmare. Thankfully, that clutter can be reduced with a solid charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charger that right now is marked down 40%. Normally priced at $50, that $20 savings means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>This power strip combines 10 different ports all together, meaning you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You get a mix of six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. With a wide range of compatibility, you won’t have to use different charging blocks all assembled together. Just plug your devices cables directly to whichever port works. In case you do still need to use one on account of having to charge several USB devices, the power station itself is designed to allow for easy access to the AC outlets. With each facing a different direction, you won’t end up dealing with losing more than one outlet due to an extra chunky adapter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Baseus’ power station is designed for a a cleaner workspace. It actually comes with an adhesive strip intended for the underside of the unit. You can keep the power station firmly in place on your desk or nightstand.</p>

<p>With all these devices charging simultaneously, you may be worried about risk of overheating. Well, the Baseus power stirp utilizes GaN6 technology for safer, cooler charging. It’s been engineered for efficient heat dissipation soi you stuff can charge fast without getting hot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Right now, Amazon has the Baseus 10-in-1 charging station for a reduced price of just $30</a>. That’s a 40% discount down from it’s base price of $50. You’ll save a whole $20 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/treyarch-co-founder-game-dev-drone-firefighting-plane-jail-time-federal-court-2000626833</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/treyarch-co-founder-sentenced-to-federal-prison-after-flying-drone-into-firefighting-aircraft-in-january.1301580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. It’s Friday Eve, also known as Thursday. The weekend is almost here. I can feel it in my bones. While we wait, here’s today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have news about a Treyarch co-founder, a leaked <em>Yakuza</em> remake appears, Nvidia is making a big investment, and more <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is on the way in the near future.</p> <h2>Treyarch Co-Founder Peter Tripp Akemann Sentenced To Prison And House Arrest</h2> <p>In January, Peter Tripp Akemann flew a drone into a large firefighting aircraft that was helping to stop the horrible Palisades fire in the area around Los Angeles. The damage took the aircraft out of commission for a period of time. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-piloting-drone-during-la-fires">In February, Akemann pleaded guilty</a> to the crime. <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/southern-california/public-safety/2025/09/15/culver-city-man-sentencing-crashed-drone-into-super-scooper">And on Monday, Akemann was sentenced</a> by U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald to serve 14 days in federal prison, followed by 30 days of home arrest. Akemann, who helped create the studio that is now part of Activision’s massive <em>Call of Duty</em> machine, will also have to pay around $156,000 in various fines.</p> <p>As part of a previous plea agreement, Akemann will also complete 150 hours of community service. His lawyers shared a message from the Treyarch co-founder earlier this year stating he was “deeply sorry” about damaging the aircraft and that he “accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends.”</p>

 <h2><em>Yakuza 3</em> Remake Accidentally Leaks Online</h2> <p>It looks like<em> Yakuza 3,</em> originally released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, is getting a big ol’ remake. That’s according to a leak fans spotted earlier this week on the <em>Yakuza</em> developer’s very own website. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rgg-accidentally-leaked-that-its-working-on-yakuza-kiwami-3-211036458.html">As reported by <em>Engadget</em></a>, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios briefly listed<em> Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> alongside two previously released remakes, <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> and <em>Yakuza Kiwami 2.</em> However,<em> Kiwami 3</em> has yet to be officially announced. Oops!</p> <p>The listing has since been scrubbed from the site, but not before fans could document it via screenshots and social media posts. Many expect this new remake to be announced at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show later this month.</p>

 <h2><em>Microsoft Flight Sim 2024</em> Reportedly The Next Xbox Game Leaping To PS5</h2> <p>If you thought Xbox was done bringing more games to PlayStation 5, well, then you probably haven’t been paying attention to the company’s activity over the last year or so. Anyway, Xbox is, <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">according to a new report from Polish news site <em>PPE</em>,</a> porting <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> to the PS5. It’s claimed that this new port will be arriving in November of this year and will get a limited physical release. Xbox has yet to confirm, but this seems pretty likely to happen, and I expect an announcement soon.</p> <h2>Nvidia Investing $5 Billion Into Struggling Intel As Part Of Larger Partnership</h2> <p>Well, here’s something unexpected. Nvidia, one of the richest companies on the planet, is partnering with Intel, which has been struggling in recent years, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidia-bets-big-intel-with-5-billion-stake-chip-partnership-2025-09-18/">as part of a large deal that involves the GPU giant investing $5 billion</a>. The two companies issued a joint press release confirming the news and announced plans to work together to create “Intel x86 RTX SOCs” that will likely be used in devices like handheld PCs, laptops, and other portable electronics.</p> <p>As you might expect, this deal also includes a lot of talk about how this will help boost AI performance and move the technology forward. With this investment, Nvidia is now one of Intel’s largest shareholders. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-holds-high-stakes-meeting-with-intel-ceo-after-calling-his-resignation-2025-08-11/">Weirdly, the U.S. government is an even bigger shareholder</a> after a wild deal was struck last month, giving the United States 10 percent ownership of the chip maker.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/henry-halfhead-review-cozy-sandbox-sim-switch-2000626517"><em>Henry Halfhead</em> is a short game worth playing</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-james-channel-halo-dangerous-steel-battalion-modder-2000626530">The most dangerous Xbox has been created</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-debut-short-film-rating-netflix-2000626490"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> is getting a new short film soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> won't include console-only crossplay after all, despite reports to the contrary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, based on an interview from IGN with Battlefield 6 senior combat designer Matthew Nickerson and technical director Christian Buhl, that console players across PlayStation and Xbox would be able to play together without PC players.</p>
<p>It now transpires this is not the case, as per a clarification from EA to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/battlefield/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-wont-have-console-only-crossplay-after-all-3252439/">Dexerto</a>. EA has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>

<p>So how will crossplay work in Battlefield 6?</p>
<p>Nickerson was at least correct in how crossplay will work for console players when the toggle is turned on. Here, PlayStation and Xbox players will be prioritised before PC players are added to fill a lobby.</p>
<p>However, if crossplay is turned off, players will only play with others on their current platform. As such, Xbox and PlayStation players won't be able to play together exclusively without PC players. They also won't be able to party up with or join players on other platforms.</p>
<p>This will be disappointing for fans who had hoped to play across platforms, but without PC players.</p>
<p>That's because cheating tends to be more prevalent on PC, something console players are keen to avoid.</p>
<p>"Obviously, cheating is much more prevalent on PC than on console, but we are taking a lot of effort, putting a lot of work into prioritising fighting against cheaters," said Buhl. "We've turned on secure boot. We've got Javelin, our new anti-cheat system, which is required in order to play.</p><p>"So, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible. We have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with. That's what I can say. Now, we can never win against cheaters, right? Cheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of - to the health of - the game."</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be out on 10th October across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">don't expect a Switch 2 version any time soon</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced it will add two more GBA classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of cutesy platformers and puzzlers, you're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Following on from the addition of other Game Boy Advance titles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a>&nbsp;</em>to the service this year, the two games being added in this latest update are puzzler&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>and platformer&nbsp;<em>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</em>.</p>

<p>The former was originally released for the GBA in 2005 (in the US, at least), subsequently receiving a re-release for the Wii U in 2014. Like other&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller&nbsp;</em>games, you'll need to dig through a series of differently-colored blocks to emerge victorious, and there are many blocks with different properties with which you'll need to contend.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mr.-driller-2-game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=iMAQqZRT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mr.-driller-2-game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=OoiY1JyO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>is one of two GBA games being added to Nintendo Switch Online soon.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>began its life as an arcade game; it was a launch title for the GBA in Japan, but it didn't come to Western shores until a few years later, launching in Europe in 2004 and the USA in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second GBA game in this update is the underrated platformer <i>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</i>, which, rather than being a spinoff of the main&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>series, serves more as a side story to the core games.</p>

<p>It plays very similarly to previous&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>titles, although since it's a Game Boy Advance game, you might not find it quite as impressive on the technical side as its bigger console brethren. Still, it's just as cute and endearing as the regular&nbsp;<em>Klonoa&nbsp;</em>games are.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer that shows off both&nbsp;<em>Mr. Driller 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Both of these GBA games are being added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on September 25th, but as usual when it comes to Game Boy Advance additions, you'll need the Expansion Pack addon to play them. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> has its long-awaited 1.0 release later this month, but if you haven’t played the first game yet, you should really start warming up with that first. Supergiant Games’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803">2020 GOTY contender</a> is currently on sale to celebrate its five-year anniversary. You can grab <em>Hades 1</em> for less than most meals on the McDonald’s menu. Your heart will be better off, too.</p> <p>The action-RPG roguelike is about the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld and reach Mount Olympus. Players have to choose between competing upgrades and survive isometric bullet-hell battles to do so. A range of weapons and buildcrafting options, combined with incredible art and rich worldbuilding, make it an all-around exceptional game. Part classic arcade beat ’em up, part engrossing visual novel, <em>Hades</em> has something for everyone. Maybe that’s why it inspired Supergiant to make its first sequel.</p> <p><em>Hades</em> is normally $25, but right now it’s 75 percent off until September 30 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hades-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOorNEZO4qZlxH5rvIgBR45p8YVScR59SD9KL2Tl8FfcUrFXtCTbS">the Switch eShop</a>. At just $6.24, it’s a steal. If you don’t already own it on Switch 2, now’s the time.</p>

 <p>Now I know what you’re thinking. Why buy<em> Hades 1</em> when <em>Hades 2</em> is just around the corner? <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272">The sequel launches September 25</a> after years in Early Access and is, on the surface at least, simply more <em>Hades</em>. But it tells a completely different story, stars a hero that’s more ranged-centric than the first game’s Zagreus, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">definitely harder overall</a>.</p> <p>Is this a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> situation? Based on my time with the Early Access version I’m not ready to say, but new players will definitely benefit from warming up in the first game and getting a feel for the flow and decision-making that comes with selecting between all of the different upgrade paths. And hell, by the time you actually finish <em>Hades 1</em>, maybe the second game will be on sale for $6.29 too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ship was on fire. My crewmates were off-ship capturing the nearby defense cannons to aid our fleet, and I was fighting half a dozen Legion vessels. I wasn’t sure how long I could last solo, but if they didn’t get me, the fire would. I pointed the bow of our C-3 Catamaran away from the fighting, locked in the ship’s cruise control, and got up from the pilot’s seat, and turned to find most of the top level covered in flames. The lower decks weren’t much better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed the closest extinguisher and sprinted across the ship, putting out the inferno as fast as I could. Fortunately, the Legion ships gave me a few moments to breathe. When the fire was smothered, I turned us around. The cruise control had taken the Catamaran much farther away from the action than I anticipated, and the rest of my crew needed help. Our core integrity still wasn’t great; a few good hits, and we’d be just one more of the floating hulks we’d passed to get to this sector. But I didn’t have the materials for repairs. Not a great hand, but you play the cards you’re dealt. I angled the Catamaran’s nose toward the cannons – and the Legion ships surrounding them – kicked on the boosters, and prayed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Space Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jump Space excels in the moments when you and your crew are surviving by the skin of your teeth, putting out fires, repairing damaged thrusters, making ammo as fast as your weapons can fire it, and fighting attackers that have just jumped in to ruin your day. The successes are exhilarating; the failures, usually at least memorable. But like a run that ends early and leaves you wondering what might have been, the limits of the early access version become apparent on just about every mission. There’s no doubt that the potential for an epic game is here; it’s just a matter of whether or not it will be reached, and how long it’ll be until then. For now, though, Jump Space is definitely worth at least a short trip through the stars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are technically characters in Jump Space, but aside from your ship’s AI Iris and Buddy (an adorable robot that accompanies you on missions if your crew is shorthanded), I couldn’t tell you their names without looking them up. They’re there to give you quests and rewards and provide some flavor about the backstory of a robot uprising that drove humanity into exile between missions, but once you select a mission from the galaxy map and head out, they quickly disappear from memory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Space excels in the moments when you and your crew are surviving by the skin of your teeth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each mission consists of a roguelike-style run of several jumps, each chosen from a few paths on your route from your base to where you need to go. Each choice closes some options and opens others, and each individual jump offers different rewards including components for your ship, fragments of maps that open up new parts of the galaxy, or artifacts that provide upgrades for that run, such as restoring health when your crew is close together or dealing damage absorbed by your ships’ shields back to attackers. Choosing the right route is crucial to maximize the stuff you’ll need for that run, but also what you’re looking to bring back to the hanger as a permanent get, so it’s usually a decision you’ll want to take a moment to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every jump also brings its own trials, whether you’re navigating the wrecks of other ships and avoiding a solar flare from a nearby star, fighting off a fleet of Legion ships patrolling the sector, or simply exploring an uninhabited sector and scavenging the floating hulks around you for supplies before moving on. The joy here is in the act of playing, of launching out of your ship into the unknown, flying through space under your suit’s power, using your grapple to pull yourself to a nearby buoy or boarding a ship after you disable it. Mastery allows you to flow from on-foot combat to zero-G flight to piloting your ship or manning its guns smoothly, but there’s also something relaxing about scouring a floating wreck blessedly free of evil robots, too, or simply sharing a pizza you made in the ship’s food processor with your crew. In many ways, Jump Space is an interactive chat room, an excuse to hang out with friends while enjoying a fun little space-themed co-op game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, until the Legion shows up. Most Legion ships, aside from the missile-barragging Corvettes or “What just hit me?” Snipers, are easy to deal with individually, but the challenge comes from (as their name suggests) their numbers. On foot, things are harder, whether you’re dodging the small spider-bots that scurry up to you before unleashing their flamethrowers or the floating bots that pepper you from range, and everything from bipedal walkers to spider-tanks. Despite how much more difficult the on-foot missions can be, though, they’re not necessarily more engaging. Movement options aside (which aren’t always available because you need either a point to grapple to or a place where you can engage your suit’s jet drive boosters) Jump Space is a pretty standard shooter with pretty standard weapons like shotguns, rifles, and machine guns. If it were just these on-foot fights, it wouldn’t be a notable game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, that’s just one aspect of many, and the best moments combine everything: battling other ships, repelling boarders or leaving half your crew to activate an objective while the others defend your ship from assault, coordinating repairs and who is manning what, spending your limited resources to craft the right thing at the right time, and deciding whether to save scrap for permanent resources when you get back to your hanger or to disassemble it to build what you need right now. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest issue that will hopefully be resolved in future content updates is repetition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It leads to some fun improvization. In the mission I described in the opening, things got so hectic that I wasn’t even landing the ship to pick up my crewmates when they needed to move between the cannons we were trying to capture and hold; I was just getting close enough that they could grapple to the ship, and then I’d get them close enough to launch themselves to the objective. We didn’t have time for anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest issue that will hopefully be resolved in future content updates, whether it’s on-foot or aboard ship, is repetition. Moving a bunch of batteries, or finding and installing nuclear fuses to power a door is fun the first time, but it gets less fun when you’ve played just a few hours and you can already enter an area and know exactly what the objective will be because it’s what always takes place in that space. The big, run-ending finales which can involve defending a capital ship, activating those cannons, grabbing and ferrying cargo from a downed ship before Legion forces jump into the system, or doing something as simple as playing King of the Hill to establish communications hold their novelty longer because you know what you’re going to get from the mission select screen, and you can avoid one if you’re tired of it. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case for the stuff you’ll have to do on the en-route jumps because your choices can lock you into certain objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the early access of it all. Some of it is cute, like placeholder text that says “Not Made :(“ when an asset isn’t there. Others are less charming, like when Legion ships and bots defy the bounds of Euclidian space and travel unencumbered through walls or asteroids. Now, maybe I missed something in the lore that allows them to do that, but my first thought was, “Man, I wish I could do that!” right up until one of my buddies actually did but got stuck in the ceiling during an on-foot segment, which isn’t as funny as it sounds. Combine that with frequent disconnects and crashes, which often cost my friends progress, and it’s hard to say that Jump Space’s airlocks are fully sealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a little short on features you might expect from a game like this, like being able to buy artifacts for your runs before that run starts (those are teased but not available yet) and the limited number of pilotable ships and customization options. I love being able to slap another railgun on the Catamaran, too, but in about 15 hours it was the only other thing we found that seemed useful. And yeah, more reactors are neat (and playing Tetris with your components to find the right way to power everything is fun), but I still haven’t found one that matches the Split Reactor you start with. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The way Buddy trash-talks the Legion bots after he takes them down with his tiny pistol? Perfection.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the second ship you get, the smaller, faster DT-4 Dart, feels lesser than the Catamaran. I understand the appeal for teams of two or solo players, but as far as we could tell it was lacking basic things like an ammo-refill station, and walking around the outside of the ship was so difficult it was essentially impossible, which is a problem when you need to go outside and fix something. My crewmates hated it so much that we got halfway through a run before abandoning ship and swapping back to our beloved C-3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are plenty of smart decisions, too. The missions scale to player count nicely, and you seem significantly less likely to have major ship malfunctions with a crew of two than a crew of three, when it’s easier to deal with. I also love Buddy, who will not only help out on the ship when there’s just two humans playing, but will actually leave the ship when you’re flying solo to help you out in an on-foot fight. And when he revives you and then gives you a little fistbump, or you hear him trash-talking the Legion bots after he takes them down with his tiny pistol? Perfection. That’s <em>my boy</em> right there. Ride or die. I thought playing solo would be a slog but it was anything but, and that’s all due to Buddy. You can even play soccer in the hangar between missions, complete with dialogue for when you score – or accidentally punt the ball into the nearby canyon.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Co-op Shooters</h3><p>There are a lot of co-op shooters out there. Here are the best ones.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also just a funny game, even when you’re downed because you held an irradiated fuse too long and are begging your friends to save you, or are unable to get off of an exploding ship in time and floating in space, waiting to be revived. And being able to survive a jump, which requires you to be seated, while sitting on the toilet? Talk about boldly going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I have one major complaint beyond the technical stuff and the early access growing pains, it’s how long some missions are. While there are 20-minute missions, many of them start at 40 minutes and you’ll regularly see ones that are an hour plus. That’s a long commitment, especially if you fail and lose most of what you would have gained. I mean, I’m not saying the starting pistol is <em>bad</em>, per se, but when you lose all the other, fancier weapons you had and have to either craft or find them again, you notice. The same is true of a quest you might have to do again. I’m not saying there shouldn’t be friction and failure; I’d just like to see more bite-sized missions when I’m not ready to devote my whole evening to a single run.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">After completing Jump Space’s first early access chapter, trying out both of its ships, and spending around 15 hours traveling the stars I quite like what’s here, even, like your starting ship, it’s still under construction. It’s best enjoyed with a group, in part because co-op games almost always are and also because there are plenty of relatively quiet moments where it’s basically a chill chat room in space. There are some parts of this ship that need a little TLC, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nearly always having fun playing it, even when things got hectic or buggy. Even when things seem all but lost and everything’s on fire, you can still pull it out if you and your crew work together, play smart, and get a little lucky. It’s the kind of moment a game like this has to be able to create if it’s going to work, but even though there’s still work to do to get Jump Space shipshape and add variety to its mission objectives, it’s already proven its concept is a winner.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-space-review-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review.1301517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Live and Learn is more than just one of the best songs in Sonic history; it also feels like a philosophy SEGA has taken to heart with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. I've spent over 35 hours drifting, boosting, and gathering rings across an excellent set of tracks that span Sonic's 34-year history. Minutes effortlessly turned into hours, perfecting my drifting technique, customizing my vehicles, finding the optimal race lines in time trials, and frantically competing with friends to be the Grand Prix champion. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds could have been just another pit stop among a Grand Prix of 2025 kart racers, but instead it put the pedal to the metal and refused to let me take my hands off the wheel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've played my fair share of kart racers over the past few decades starring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review"><u>Sonic</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review"><u>Crash</u></a>, and plenty of other popular characters. While most are amusing enough, only a few reach that upper pantheon of party games that dominate every get together. With 39 tracks, 24 characters, a nice suite of multiplayer options, tons of challenges to complete, and such a long list of unlockable cosmetics that I still can’t see its finish line, CrossWorlds doesn’t just want to be part of the rotation: it has set its sights on taking the top spot for me and my friends. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CrossWorlds’ racing is quick to pick up thanks to its intuitive and straightforward controls, essentially boiling down to four main actions: accelerate, drift, brake, and use an item. Racing feels great whether you're zipping into shortcuts, landing massive trick combos for a big boost, or nailing a complicated drift that asks you to rapidly change direction on a curvy path. I love how the vehicles feel, as every action fluidly transitions from one into the next, allowing me to chain drifts into jumps into tricks into boosts before launching into another drift to repeat the process again… provided my opponents didn’t send any items my way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting hit with items, messing up a turn, or colliding with a wall definitely cost me a few races, but more often than not they felt more like small speed bumps thanks to the generous placement of boost panels and item capsules on most courses. Those  hits do reduce your ring count, which in turn lowers your top speed, but it rarely took me more than a few seconds to get back on track – and you can reduce that lag time even further depending on how you tune your vehicle. The type of ride you pick will help you eke out extra advantages: Power vehicles are great at shoving other racers around, Handling vehicles make it easier to nail even the trickiest of sharp turns, and the long-awaited return of Sonic Riders' hover boards enabled me to boost like no other when hitting dash panels or using the boosting Wisp items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The headlining feature is the fantastic CrossWorlds mechanic that not only keeps every race interesting but also adds a good amount of depth. Outside of Grand Prix Mode, the second lap of each race almost seamlessly transports everyone to a different course, similar to the dimension jumping done in 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-review"><u>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</u></a>. Warping from the naval scenery of Metal Harbor to the prehistoric Dinosaur Jungle or the incredibly curvy Dragon's Road kept me on my toes every race. This was already my favorite part of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds’ public test demos before my review, but I began to see the true brilliance of it as I put more time into the full game. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The fantastic CrossWorlds mechanic keeps races interesting and adds depth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Different vehicle types excel on different tracks, so making the second lap random adds depth when customizing your ride since you need to consider variables beyond just the course you’ve chosen. My speed-focused vehicle would sing on tracks with many straightaways or boost panels, but would often give up a few positions to racers who tuned for acceleration or handling on tracks filled with constant curves and sharp turns. Since some tracks have portions where you transform into a boat or plane, I found myself making one loadout that could adapt to whatever course ended up as the second lap while still maximizing my potential for the first and final lap on the main track. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Transforming into Flight and Water Forms is as simple as passing through a gate with the matching plane or boat icons. Some transformations are required, such as the Water Form swap at the start of Kraken Bay, while others are optional, like the short Flight Form path on Coral Town if you take a specific branching path, but I was never unhappy to seize the opportunity to change things up – in fact, I would have loved a few more CrossWorlds that gave me extended periods of time in the sky. Flight Form in always handled like a dream, letting you drift vertically to reach items, rings, and boost gates at different elevations. However, a few of the Water Form sections can feel clunky until you figure out the correct rhythm and timing to accelerate, drift, and trick on each course. Vehicles with better handling seem to perform the best during these transformations, so whenever I was having a hard time with a specific section , I would practice in one of those vehicles before returning to my preferred Speed type options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No lap during CrossWorlds feels like another, and though the last lap returns to your original track, there are significant changes during it. Paths that were inaccessible open up, improved item boxes appear with better drop rates for stronger options, and more hazards show up on the course. There are even significant structural changes, like a rocket in Metal Harbor finally launching, which removes two paths and forces everyone into a newly formed spine (or two quarter pipes placed back to back, for those who don't skate). </p><div data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><form action="#" data-cy="poll-content"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><p><h2 data-cy="poll-question" id="poll-question">Pick Your Sonic Team</h2></p></legend><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60019" id="answerId60019-label"><span>Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60020" id="answerId60020-label"><span>Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, E123-Omega)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60021" id="answerId60021-label"><span>Team Rose (Amy Rose, Big, Cream and Cheese)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60022" id="answerId60022-label"><span>Team Eggman (Eggman, Metal Sonic, Egg Pawn)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60023" id="answerId60023-label"><span>Team Chaotix (Espio, Charmy, Vector)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60024" id="answerId60024-label"><span>Team Mystic (Silver, Blaze)</span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId60025" id="answerId60025-label"><span>Babylon Rogues ( Jet, Wave, Storm)</span></label></p></div></fieldset></form></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without the CrossWorlds mechanic, the courses available at launch are all excellent. There are 15 tracks that can only arrive during that second lap, and then 24 main courses for them to show up in, with Coral Town possibly being my favorite. Its looping paths create so many routes that I'm still wrapping my head around which one is the most ideal in time trials – I always found myself changing the route I took depending on my position, character, vehicle, and lap number. Other standouts are classic stages like Market Street, which originated as Rooftop Run in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/12/sonic-unleashed-review"><u>Sonic Unleashed</u></a>, and Radical Highway from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/22/sonic-adventure-2"><u>Sonic Adventure 2</u></a>, the latter of which had me riding the main cables to the top using boost pads to leave my competitors behind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every course feels perfectly tuned with risks and rewards; different routes have different advantages, with some having more rings to help you reach your maximum top speed, while others have more boost panels to provide some speed in the short run in the hopes you will either get far enough ahead not to need the extra rings or at least have enough breathing room to pick them up later. One course that proved to be my Achilles heel: Pumpkin Mansion. The final third of the track is full of giant pumpkins that vanish as you approach, but until the first person reaches them, they hide a section full of sharper turns. They always affected the timing of my drifts until I took the time to memorize their positions through time trials and figured out which paths I should take. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, a kart racer would just be a basic racing game without items to inject a little chaos into them. CrossWorlds has 24 different items that can be pulled from boxes placed all over each course, most of which had me shouting with equal amounts of either excitement or bitterness depending on if I was on the giving or receiving end of each. The iconic Wisps from Sonic Colors are here and offer items in the form of a boost, laser, and drill, which are all helpful to either catch up or extend your lead. These were always welcome as they enabled me to cut across off-road sections and dodge certain attacks, like the punishing Slime and Weight items, if used with proper timing. There are plenty of other cool options as well, like a bomb that grows in size the longer you hold it, eventually becoming a giant wrecking ball that flattens enemies it collides with until its detonation. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Customizing Gadget Panels scratched the min-maxing itch I love in games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tornado quickly became my favorite item because of its ability to negate most incoming attacks while also dealing damage to as many opponents that I could bump into. There is also the Monster Truck, which is sure to be a standout for many, as it transforms your vehicle into a massive machine that flattens opponents, renders you immune to all other items, and allows you to drive off-road without any penalties. By default, you can hold two items at a time, but you can also add the option for a third item or swap between your two items by installing specific upgrades in your customizable Gadget Panel if you really want to lean into the chaos, though I typically leaned toward Gadgets that made me faster, not fiercer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gadgets offer a wide range of extremely impactful bonuses, with more than 30 different options to place on your Gadget Panel before a race. Now, they won’t suddenly craft you a win out of thin air, as your racing skills still remain the most important factor – but when utilized to their maximum potential, Gadgets can be the difference between getting first and fourth place. There are Gadgets to alter your vehicle's stats, improve drift performance, increase the rings you can carry, and grant unique starting items that can't normally be found in races, like a Warp Ring that teleports you on top of the racer just ahead of you, causing you to squish them. The tricky part is figuring out what combination to use; each Gadget Panel has six slots in a two-by-three pattern, and each Gadget requires between one and three slots. Building my Panel became a tiny puzzle with no wrong answers, and it scratched the min-maxing itch I love in games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can prebuild five Gadget Panels and then swap between them before each race, which helps you adjust to specific situations, modifying the base stats of your character and vehicle selection as needed. The roster has nearly all the major characters you’d hope to see from each generation of Sonic: in addition to the usual Team Light and Dark, you’ve got characters from the Sonic Heroes, Riders, Advance, Rush, Colors, and even recent newcomers like Sage from Frontiers. It didn't take long for me to find my favorite in Shadow using a modified Speed-type vehicle, so much so that I used him to clear all eight cups on the Sonic Speed and Super Sonic Speed difficulty (the equivalents of 150cc and 200cc in Mario Kart), only needing minor tweaks outside of regularly adjusting my Gadget Panel. While it was rare for most CPU opponents to give me trouble, a few of the Grands Prix still had the ideal amount of challenge thanks to CrossWorlds’ modular rival system. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before starting each Grand Prix, a random character appears as your rival, and they then act as a supercharged CPU to race against with a challenge level from one to 10, similar to raising the heat level in the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate campaign. Your rival isn't just a CPU racer with better stats, they interject with snarky comments of frustration and glee throughout the races, adding a bit of character to what could have just been a slightly more competent CPU racer. While I haven’t tested every combination of racer and rival, the 20 or so I’ve seen so far all had unique voice lines, which really helped breathe even more life into them. Rivals also behave more intelligently, holding onto defensive items until they need them, taking better racing lines as they drift around corners, and even moving to ensure they take items they expect those behind them to go for. I had to use a not-insignificant amount of retries when racing rivals that were level eight or higher, which is just the right amount of pushback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, CrossWorlds does something I wish every other racing game would do with its in-game currency, Donpa tickets. I would usually net anywhere between 10 and 40 tickets per race, depending on my performance and if I achieved certain feats. That includes things like using the most items, choosing which course is selected for lap two by being in first when reaching the travel ring at the end of lap one, or picking up the series’ iconic red rings. Tickets have a variety of uses, including unlocking various car parts or customization options, increasing your friendship with a character for rewards unique to them, and – my favorite use – retrying a race for better placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I know what you're thinking: retrying a race is hardly new, but CrossWorlds differs in that you can spend a measly 20 tickets to retry in the middle of a Grand Prix <em>without </em>entirely starting over. So if you get hit with three items on the final turn of the final lap of the final race only to watch your rival and six other racers pass you in the homestretch, you can rewind and try again as many times as you can afford, which cuts down on pointless repetition a lot. Grands Prix also get an exciting and welcome shakeup: instead of racing on a fourth course to end things, the final race is a combination of one lap from the previous three, which tests how well you can adapt to each. That said, I do miss the mission-based Story Mode from Team Sonic Racing, which gave you interesting bonus challenges to accomplish during each stage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Earning tickets feels a bit stingy compared to the cost of unlocking some cosmetics.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also have to dig into the friendship system more, as it will take thousands of races to complete if your goal is to maximize your ranking with each character. Instead of funneling tickets into car parts, you can give them to your favorite characters to receive cosmetics like titles, decals, and alternate costumes in return. These specific unlockables get really expensive really fast: it took me 3000 tickets to earn the first four rewards for Shadow, including one alternate costume, and there is still more for me to unlock. It's clear that SEGA is hoping this will be a system that keeps you drawn in, as with 24 characters, that's a ludicrous number of tickets to unlock everything. I have mixed feelings on this because it gives the most dedicated fans something to chase, but the rate for earning tickets currently feels a bit too stingy when compared to the cost of unlocking some cosmetics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That sticker shock gets even worse when you consider the fact that new characters are already on the horizon, including Hatsune Miku, Joker from Persona 5, and Ichiban from the Like a Dragon franchise, all of which have been announced as upcoming free additions. There will also be characters and tracks for SpongeBob, TMNT, and Avatar: The Last Airbender coming as part of the paid season pass. While I don't necessarily need them since I already have more favorites on the Sonic roster than I do fingers, it is exciting to think of what other characters and tracks could be joining even later down the road. In fact, during <a href="https://youtu.be/9RT6XyOFlTg?si=yA1AU3XwsB_7Y8f0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>my interview with Takashi Iizuka of SEGA at Gamescom</u></a>, they said they plan to support CrossWorlds with new content like this each month for at least the first year after launch, which is an impressive pace given there’s already plenty of unlockables and alternate modes to keep those who blaze through the cups busy at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of those distractions is the Race Park, which consists of six different rule sets, but also allows you to create custom matches to fit whatever you and up to three others want to play locally. These are all available online as well by joining the Friend Match option, though they are limited to one player per console, but it at least allows you to race with groups of up to 12 friends. Currently, every mode boils down to a race for points, but the modified rules change how they play out. In addition to the regular 12-player free-for-all race style, there are also special team modes with rules that grant bonuses for grabbing the most rings, colliding with teammates, using the most dash panels, or landing the most item hits on opponents. These modes were a blast with friends, as they didn't fully rely on who knew the courses the best. It's also something worth playing for a bit, as there are eight different rival CPU teams to take down that unlock special vehicles you can then customize with other parts. The custom rule set is a standout feature here for local multiplayer, too, giving you control over how many races you do back to back, which courses can appear as the Crossworld second lap, what items appear in item boxes, and the speed and difficulty level while racing. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Gotta Go Fast Playlist</h3><p>Jada's Favorite Sonic Games Ranked</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Race Park's one drawback is that, while not necessary, the Gadget Panels can be overly influential to the outcome of races, so it was a let-down that there were no pre-built ones for newcomers. They did have access to everything I had unlocked, but that meant spending time for them to decipher what each one did and figuring out which ones they wanted to set into their Panels. I hope Sega alleviates this with a patch that adds some default Gadget Panels optimized for different vehicle types and playstyles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Race Park, there is also a Time Trial mode that challenges you to race for the best time on both the Sonic and Super Sonic Speed settings. I initially went into Time Trial mode expecting to run through a few tracks just to see what it offered, but it ended up being where I spent more time than anywhere else. After clearing some courses with an A rank (the minimum rank necessary to earn progress towards rewards), I was suddenly hungry for more. Each race, I found myself tinkering with the various car parts and Gadgets, and rewatching my own ghost to see what I could change or where I could improve. What if I save my boost for this turn vs that turn, or what if I sacrifice a bit of my speed to improve my handling stat to nail that hairpin? Before CrossWorlds, I was never a huge Time Trial person, but these hooked me by putting the most enticing thing they could behind them as a reward: my favorite Sonic music to listen to while racing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sonic game would be incomplete without a banger of a soundtrack, and CrossWorlds rarely fails to impress with its nearly 100 unique tracks. The primary songs are excellent, with popular tracks like Radical Highway, Market Street, Ocean View, and plenty of others all getting the CrossWorlds treatment. And for you Sonic Adventure 2 fans, don't worry, because Escape From the City is here, but you will need to clear all 79 time trials with at least an A ranking to unlock it. All the great artists that have created music for Sonic games here are: Tee Lopes, Tomoya Ohtani, Takahiro Kai, and plenty more. Similar to Sonic x Shadow Generations from last year, unlocking this music does more than just let you listen to them in a jukebox; you can also gather your favorites and slot that playlist (or any of the other six premade albums) as the music for each of the three laps of every race. Possibly the most impressive part of that is how seamlessly they all transition into each other, with each song starting at a different point depending on what lap it plays on. I only wish I could create multiple favorites playlists to have even more control. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Online functionality is simple but effective, and worked well pre-launch.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The last and potentially one of the most critical elements that could decide whether CrossWorlds takes the podium is how online play functions. Ahead of launch, we had a few days to test it and see what it offered. To my enjoyment, it worked as well as I'd hoped, with the caveat that my not-quite-full lobbies were regularly supplemented with CPUs to fill out all 12 spots. Online does have a drawback compared to this year's Mario Kart World since it's limited to just one player per console, but the inclusion of crossplay is a decent trade off, and I saw virtually no lag with my wired connection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Online functionality is simple but effective – you can see other players on your specific console’s friend list, your CrossWorlds in-game friend list, a history of others you’ve raced against, and your fair play points, which is a 100-point gauge that decreases anytime you abandon an online race. This appears to be CrossWorlds’ method for ensuring players who are behind don’t just up and leave the race entirely, which is an appreciated inclusion even if I can’t yet say how effective it will be. Another incentive is that I unlocked even more Gadget options to alter my driving style as I rose through the ranks from E- to an eventual C- during the short prelaunch review window. And while it's too soon to tell how the difference in ranks will affect queue times, I usually found a match in less than a minute during the review period, which has a much smaller pool of players than will be there on launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, it’s great that my custom soundtracks and everything I had earned in offline mode carried over, making me all the more prepared for facing real opponents. The good news is that even fans that want to join online races on day one will still be able to earn all the Gadgets I got offline simply by racing, meaning that each online race will not only move you closer to the Gadgets from higher ranks but also the ones that unlock based on total number of races. However, those players will be at a disadvantage compared to others like myself who spent time earning them before going online, which could also be mitigated with preset Gadget Plates. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle. There are plenty of modes that entertained my friends and me for hours, and CrossWorlds will probably be a regular staple of hangouts as more courses and characters are added over the coming months – though I do wish it had the option for splitscreen when playing online. The titular Crossworld mechanic is an awesome idea that keeps each race fresh, and a great way to potentially turn the tables on opponents thanks to a lengthy list of customization options. While I'm still speeding my way to complete all the challenges, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is one that I know I'll enjoy playing plenty more of in the months to come, crossing the finish line as my new favorite kart racing game of all time.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> set a new gold standard for the genre back in 2020, the mechanics and structure of the isometric action RPG roguelites have become somewhat staid. The maze of rooms, the choice of exits, the array of collectables, the slowly progressing unlockables, the narrative that teasingly develops after every run; let’s face it, most of us could play a new genre entry in our sleep. Sure, we’d die a lot, but it’d be doable. So, it’s refreshing that Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree attempts to do something new with the standard formula, even if it isn’t always successful in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it42ZeHoj2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In what can charitably be described as an unbelievably tedious opening cut-scene, we learn that Towa, a priestess of Shinju, has been tasked with defeating a vile demonic entity dubbed Magatsu. She’s not alone in this endeavour, and is joined by eight guardians on her journey, the Prayer Children, and it is the addition of these guys and gals that mark the game’s first deviation from standard genre form. See, rather than a player character fighting their ways through hordes of demons solo-style, they are joined by a tag-team partner to form a dynamic duo. The first character takes the lead on movement and combat, whilst their colleague, tethered to them by a magical leash, provides defensive and offensive spells.</p>


<p>It’s a neat dynamic, and one that offers a vast variety of tactical options. You are given complete freedom to ally each distinctive member of your team with another, and in whatever combination you prefer. Highlights amongst the wonderfully bonkers Prayer Children include Nishiki, a buff Koi fish, and Bampuku, an enormous fluffy warrior chef cat.</p>


<p>Due to the variety of characters, and the tremendous quantity of build customisations each possible team provides, the loadout options prior to a run can be overwhelming. On the plus side, there’s always a new approach to try when you run up against the inevitable brick wall of a particularly nasty boss. Get the combination of characters and abilities just right – perhaps more by luck and experimentation rather than skilful intention – and it’s undeniably satisfying to wipe the floor with a previously untouchable boss. However, this delight is tempered by the confusion of never quite getting to grips with the unending variables and the complexity of character builds. The poorly designed menu screens don’t help, making even basic skill upgrades a chore to decipher, let alone navigate through.</p>
<p>Indeed, for an action roguelite, there’s almost too much here, of everything. Fully voiced text conversations between characters go on for an absolute age, with everyone talking a lot but saying very little. A lot of waffle then, the video game equivalent of two lovers refusing to be the first to hang up the phone. Meanwhile, the capability to forge your own swords is comprehensive, offering a level of complexity that would make Kingdom Come: Deliverance II envious. However, some of the forging system also seems… oddly pointless. Why bother tinkering with the appearance of your sword, when it ends up in the hands of an isometric character so small that you can barely even see the thing once in combat? Thankfully, you can just get the local blacksmith to do all the forging for you, benefitting from the stat boosts, whilst also saving on a lot of button bashing QTE’s in the process.</p>

<p>If all the mission preparation is an exhausting drag, it’s in the combat itself that Towa truly shines. Fast and responsive, your fighters look gorgeous as they dash around the environment, unleashing some spectacular screen-covering special attacks. Enemies are fairly dumb, though have enough IQ to seek to overwhelm you with their numbers. As such, controlling the space is key, ensuring you can hit as many foes as possible with every attack, whilst leaving yourself room enough to dart away from any reprisal. In a neat addition, each of your lead character’s two weapons begin to dull as you hack away, requiring you to swap over to the alternative weapon on a regular basis to boost your damage, giving the combat a satisfying rhythmic pace.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, despite not being able to directly control your partner, they still have a health bar and take damage, which feels particularly tight when you can’t get them out of the way of an area attack and thus lose your support spells in the process. This tag-team approach also serves to undermine the local co-op, forcing your partner to take on the role of the support character and restricting their role to casting a couple of spells. As such, they can’t take part in combat directly. This is disappointing, as a more focused co-op mode, one that stands apart from the single player campaign’s tag-team mechanics, would definitely have been welcome.</p>
<p>Even for a roguelite, difficulty spikes can be brutal, certain bosses are sword and spell sponges, whilst annoyingly having the ability to near insta-kill your player character. It forces you to get back to base and tinker with your abilities, settings and unlockables to even stand a chance. Thankfully, if it’s all too much, an easy mode takes the edge off the pain of the difficulty somewhat.</p>

<p>Visually, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree is completely gorgeous. Charismatic character design, phenomenal use of colour, and sumptuous environments make this a real looker of a game. Whilst the dialogue remains over-written and dull throughout, the visual storytelling leads you to connect with each and every member of your team. Which makes the most memorable aspect of Towa also likely its most divisive. As you progress in each run, the characters you choose are gradually sacrificed for the greater good and removed from play. This is both emotionally gutting – Bampuku is too cute and cuddly to die – as well as adding an additional challenge to the game; forcing you to vary up your builds, even in the late game, and demanding you continue to experiment to complete future runs. This is a fascinating addition, one that elevates Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree above being merely ‘inspired-by-Hades’ fodder, into something far more demanding and – most thrillingly – unique.</p>

Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops.

Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>

Not just an expert brawler, 007 is also a talented sharpshooter, and that's an area of the game that developer IO Interactive is investing efforts into perfecting.</p><p>While the studio is no stranger to gunplay thanks to the wide variety of firearms that players could wield in the Hitman games, there is a key difference here in how Bond and Agent 47 use guns. "In Hitman we viewed ranged combat as a last resort for most players, which made it fairly hard and for most players something they wanted to avoid," said gameplay director Andreas Krogh said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-director-says-ioi-set-a-challenge-for-itself-to-create-the-best-weapon-handling-we-have-done-to-date-because-unlike-hitman-ranged-combat-isnt-a-last-resort/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer via GamesRadar</a>.

      </div>
<p>Krogh added that gunplay in 007: First Light is designed to feel fluid and responsive, giving Bond a lethal--and mechanically satisfying--option for when his license to kill is activated. In comparison, using guns in IO's Hitman games carried significant risks, as being caught using a weapon would typically result in Agent 47 having to face off against a small army of persistent foes. Guns also had handling characteristics in the game that were authentic to their real-life counterparts, as recoil, bullet drop-off, and physically aiming a weapon made it somewhat impractical to use them when you could simply frame an assassination as a freak accident instead.</p><p>007: First Light launches on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and in case you missed the recent gameplay livestream, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/">14 new things we learned about the James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-some-of-the-biggest-levels-that-hitman-dev-has-ever-built/1100-6534477/">how IO built some of its biggest levels yet</a> for its secret agent simulator.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In a separate post, Gearbox said, "We're reading every piece of feedback you share." In addition to the second PC patch, Gearbox said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gearbox-has-heard-your-borderlands-4-complaints-is-exploring-fov-slider-options-on-console/1100-6534735/" data-ref-id="1100-6534735">field of view (FOV) slider option for consoles</a> is now in testing and more information is coming "very soon" about this. Console players have also reported issues with performance, and Gearbox said it's "investigating those with planned updates coming."</p><p>Gearbox said "millions" of people have played Borderlands 4 so far, but publisher 2K Games has not released any official sales numbers as of yet.</p><p>For comparison, 2019's Borderlands 3 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-3-marks-fastest-selling-2k-game-ever-r/1100-6470015/" data-ref-id="1100-6470015">5 million sell-in sales after its first five days</a> to become 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. Sell-in represents copies sold to retailers, sell-through is copies sold to consumers. </p><p>Borderlands 3 went on to sell-in more than 23 million units, but <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands 2 is the best-selling entry in the franchise overall</a> with more than 30 million units sold. Borderlands 4 still has one more major platform to expand onto, and that'll be the Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>If we build them, they will run</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Asobism's tower defence/roguelite/factory sim title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shapehero-factory">ShapeHero Factory</a>, releases on Switch 2 (and 1) today. Hooray!</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, this one sees you create an army of robots from a bunch of magical shapes within a factory setting, making for a sweat-inducing puzzle of sorts as you work to get your automation processes up and running before battle.</p>
<p>The twist? You don't actually get to control the robots you make in the ensuing fight here. Nope, it's all about the factory, levelling up through artefacts and creating more and more powerful units to keep on, er, powering through.</p>
<p>Here's some further — and much more official — details and screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mass-Produce Heroes<br></strong>Transport basic shapes from the scroll to assemble your heroes with different combinations. Circles with triangles will make soldiers, while circles and squares make sprites. Add squares to soldiers to give them shields. Perhaps you could create stronger heroes by combining soldiers together…</p>
<p><strong>Hold the Gates<br></strong>The Great Calamity lies deep within the Book of Magic. To bar your heroes from invading, his forces will come to demolish your gates. Maintain the defense while you forge ever deeper into the book. The servants of The Great Calamity each has its own method of attack, so you must choose the right hero for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Factory-Building and Roguelite Elements Make For Endless Possibilities<br></strong>Obtain rewards from a randomly generated list of options after winning battles.<br>
Will you unlock new artifacts (facilities), or upgrade your existing ones?<br>
As you continue making these tricky decisions, you will create a wholly unique factory!<br>
The choices that each author (playable character) will face as well as the types of heroes that they can create are different, so you need to challenge a different “factory-building” each time you play.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to Grow Stronger<br></strong>The enemies are powerful. With the experience points gained at the end of the game, players can use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to grow permanently stronger. This means that the more you play the game, the stronger you will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game left Early Access and went live with version 1.0 just yesterday over on Steam, where it's got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2389040/ShapeHero_Factory/">688 "Very Positive" reviews</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>ShapeHero Factory is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shapehero-factory-switch/">available from the Nintendo eShop for $23.99</a>, or whatever that equates to where you are. It's out on Switch 1, too, for the same price. According to Nintendo's game page, there's no specific upgrade pass for the Switch 1 version (and saves aren't transferable between them). HOWEVER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the release date, players who own the Nintendo Switch version of this title will be able to obtain the Nintendo Switch 2 version free of charge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to argue with that! We're having trouble finding specific details on what the Switch 2 version does above and beyond Switch 1 - better frame rate and resolution, you'd imagine, especially as the game page suggests a ~400MB file size increase on Switch 2. We'll update you with any details we find out.</p>
