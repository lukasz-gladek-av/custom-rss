              <p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> emerged late last year as an unlikely winner amid a sea of failed live-service slop. What made the free-to-play hero shooter succeed where others hadn’t? Was it the well-oiled gameplay loop, the massive comic book IP behind it, or the steady flow of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1moiozw/its_the_details_for_me/">gooner skins</a> for iconic characters like Emma Frost? Following the recent addition of swimsuits, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>‘ creative director was finally asked what he thinks about the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1hwovkd/me_a_overwatch_gooner_seeing_marvel_rivals_get/"><em>Overwatch</em> for gooners”</a> discourse.</p> <p>“Because our design, as mentioned earlier, is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis, and also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1mb18r8/its_phenomenal_that_psylocke_is_the_only_hero_in/">Psylocke’s Vengeance</a>, these all come from classic comic designs,” Guangyun Chen told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled">YouTube channel RivalsAssembled</a> at a recent tournament in China. “We take those classic comic designs and make some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p> <p>While Chen is right that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is drawing upon <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025">a well-established history of hyper-sexualized designs</a>, especially when it comes to female characters, every batch of skins usually includes at least a handful that suggest the NetEase studio knowns exactly what it’s doing. For example, fans instantly noticed when a pair of X-suit skins back in April buffed the butts of both Psylocke and Magik.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EXCLUSIVE: Matchmaking Explained, Playable Villains ARE Coming, more Vanguards and Strategists" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-_8Qj3spOM?start=707&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“As mentioned earlier with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline,” Chen continued without cracking a smile. “For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and also blend some popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well-received by the majority of players.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1m5ysiw/reminder_that_this_skin_is_not_part_of_the_marvel/">Sunshine Squirrel</a> is by far one of the tamer skins <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has released this summer, however. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/#10">The first batch of swimsuit outfits</a> put both Psylocke and Luna Snow in tiny bikinis. Evening out the fan-service, however, was both Loki and The Punisher in speedos. Even The <em>Fantastic Four</em>‘s Thing was airing himself out. I’m sure all of these designs were implemented with only the highest ideals of fashion and authenticity to the source material top of mind.</p> <p>In the meantime, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has more pressing issues to attend to. The game’s rating on Steam is plummeting under an influx of complaints about allegedly manipulative matchmaking. The developers say that’s not the case, though, promising to brief players on all things related to matchmaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137">in an upcoming developer video</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly five years into the lifespan of the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles, many live-service games still support the previous generation's Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but the number is always at risk of dropping. Today, Krafton announced it would be the next developer to end support for those last-gen consoles, as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will no longer be supported on Xbox One and PS4 beginning November 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox One and PS4 support for PUBG will be shut off "during live server maintenance on November 13, 2025," according to the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow ">announcement post on PUBG's official website</a>.

"This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console. We kindly ask for your understanding."</p><p dir="ltr">The post also says that PUBG will no longer be downloadable or playable on the older systems, but that all progress made will be saved and carried over to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. PlayStation players will have to download and install the PS5-specific version of PUBG to play, while Xbox players will automatically upgrade to the Series X|S version via the Smart Delivery feature.</p><p dir="ltr">"The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience," the post explains.

                <p>Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, has issued a call to the developers of Roblox to "do more" to help protect children amid ongoing reports that the platform is not doing enough to safeguard young people from bad actors.</p><p>"There is a growing issue in our country with Roblox, an online gaming platform, and the abuse of children," Khanna said in a video posted to TikTok.

"We're not going to stand by while kids are exploited online, and powerful tech companies can do more to stop it.

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta returns tomorrow for another fun-filled weekend of destructive action, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. The hiatus between the first and second weekend of the open beta was to allow Electronic Arts to make a few tweaks, and in a new blog post, the team revealed some of those adjustments.</p>



<p>Most importantly, players will be able to lean on a ‘Custom Search’ feature with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 playlist. It’s not exactly a server browser, but it’s one step closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-battlefield-6-beta-get-a-server-browser">Will The Battlefield 6 Beta Get a Server Browser?</h2>



<p>We won’t see a server browser appear during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, but we are getting Custom Search.</p>



<p>This new feature was unveiled by Electronic Arts in a new blog post, and it promises to change how you search for matches. With Custom Search, you can select specific maps and modes that you want to play, such as Conquest on Siege of Ciaro, and the matchmaking algorithm will throw you into that very match (if it’s available).</p>



<p>You’ll be able to use Custom Search across Open Weapon mode playlists during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Week 2 window, giving you the ultimate freedom to explore.</p>



<p>The inclusion of a server browser mechanic in Battlefield 6 is one of the most requested deliverables from the community, and it hasn’t gone unnoticed by Electronic Arts’ teams. Recently, DICE was asking users on social media <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-server-browser-dice-asks-what-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>why </strong>a server browser is so important</a> to them.</p>

It sounds to me like between this crossover and Tyranny Park 2, Helldivers 2 players will have a lot going on in the weeks to come.</p>

                <p>Superstar Mode has returned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a>, and it allows you to create your own player and go through the entire NFL experience. This includes the entire pre-draft process, which culminates with getting drafted by one of the 32 NFL teams. However, before you can get drafted, you need to participate in the NFL Combine. The Combine is meant to be a complete evaluation of you as a player, but it's not just your physical traits being tested. There's also a Combine interview where teams will ask you a series of questions, and you need to provide the correct answers.</p><p>While you can try to complete the interview by yourself, we have provided a list of every question and answer for the NFL Combine in the guide below. This lets you completely ace the test and get drafted highly in Madden 26's Superstar Mode.</p><h2>All NFL Combine answers in Madden 26</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289"></a><figcaption>Superstar Mode allows you to take over the NFL in Madden 26, and that starts at the Combine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg"></figure><p>In total, there are six questions you can be asked during the NFL Combine interview, but some of the questions are only for certain positions.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was the series' long-anticipated trip to Japan, but it also made some significant changes to the series. Most notable for longtime fans was the absence of "social stealth," a series mainstay that allows your assassin to blend in with a crowd. But Ubisoft says it had good reason for the change, and reassured fans that social stealth could make a comeback.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bf6t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit AMA</a>, a trio of Ubisoft developers addressed a fan who asked about social stealth elements.</p><p>"For Shadows, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth," they said. "Tthat [sic] does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin's Creed franchise, though!"</p><p>Traditionally in an Assassin's Creed game, if a guard gives chase you could lose their sight line and then blend in with a group or sit on a bench to throw them off. In Shadows, however, the shinobi character Naoe would need to find cover or use her rope to climb out of sight to evade capture, rather than just duck behind a corner and look like she's minding her own business. That was only half the equation, too, as the game also featured a samurai character, Yasuke, who was functionally a walking tank. His massive size and ornate armor means he wouldn't exactly be inconspicuous in a crowd.</p><p>The last game before Shadows, Assassin's Creed Mirage, was an explicit throwback to the series' roots, including the setting and some older gameplay elements. It included the social stealth as usual, so it has been in recent memory for the Assassin's Creed series. The next Assassin's Creed game that we know of is codenamed Assassin's Creed Hexe--which may or may not be the final title--and it's reportedly set in 16th century Europe. As the name implies, it focuses on witchcraft and even lets you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-will-let-you-possess-and-control-a-cat-report/1100-6522899/" data-ref-id="1100-6522899">possess a cat</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-nhl-26-gameplay-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-nhl-26-gameplay-deep-dive-revealed-shows-off-how-newly-integrated-player-data-should-impact-gameplay.1269480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has showcased our first real look at gameplay for EA Sports NHL 26, after first revealing the new entry and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-nhl-26-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-matthew-tkachuk/">cover athletes last week</a>.</p>



<p>While it was good to get a look at gameplay for this year's entry in EA's annual hockey sim, what was more interesting is what's behind the gameplay. The big feature of the showcase was EA's new partnership with the NHL to use the league's data collected through NHL Edge to improve the positioning of the AI-controlled players on the ice and to improve how certain star players react when you take control of them with the puck.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COInNyhDBo8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new data from NHL Edge behind EA's ICE 2.0 makes it look like players will be able to setup plays better than ever, because the computer-controlled players will know where to be, and when to be there, like having Alexander Ovechkin in his office at the top of the circle on the power play. It sounds great, but we'll see if it actually works how EA claims it'll work when the game arrives next month on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>An accompanying article on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-26/news/nhl-26-gameplay-iceq2-deep-dive">EA website</a> diving into NHL 26's gameplay also highlighted goalie movement, and how more than 80 save animations have been added this year to help make goalies more responsive and look more like their real-life counterparts. It also dug into how X-Factors have been reworked "<em>from the ground up</em>" to give them "<em>more strategic weight and make their impact more visible and consistent</em>."</p>



<p>It all sounds like solid improvements, but as is the case every year with EA's annual sports series, players won't believe the improvements are real until they feel them for themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For pretty much as long as people have been playing video games, they’ve looked for help with this boss fight or that platforming puzzle. Game guides, whether they’re commercial in nature or produced by fans, naturally arose to meet that demand. As formats have changed, and as outlets have come and gone, demand for guides has remained relatively stable.</p><p>However, like many other good things on the internet, the rollout of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s AI overviews</a> has thrown this corner of the gaming content landscape into crisis. For every writer who spends dozens of hours working on guides, there are now countless “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493360/clanker-robot-slur-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clankers</a>” working to steal the credit: If you’re stuck in <em>Blue Prince</em> and go looking for help online, there’s a good chance you’ll find the information you’re looking for featured prominently in the search results rather than on the website where it was originally published. More than just petty plagiarism, tech giants like Google and OpenAI are carelessly cannibalizing the value that game guides create for the people who write, publish and read them. And yet, there’s never been a way for guides to exist without a real human somewhere putting in the work.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Who are you gonna call?’&nbsp;</h2><p>Modern game guides might make finding the answers easy but – for as many forms as guides have taken over the years – the reality is that writing them has always been a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the weirder (but wonderful) examples of early guides was the<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/22/inside-the-nintendo-power-hotline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Nintendo Power Hotline</a>. Back in 1987, Nintendo ran what was essentially a highly specialized call center that provided the video game equivalent of customer support to players who needed it. Of course, from its novel inception right up until its end in 2005, the Nintendo Power Hotline only dealt with games that ran on hardware produced by the Japanese game company in question.&nbsp;</p><p>If you wanted help for a game that didn’t, your best bet in the late 1990s and early 2000s was a physical strategy guide like the ones compiled and produced by Prima. When it came to professionally produced guides, Prima Games wasn’t the only game in town, but it was widely known in its heyday. Founded in 1990 by Ben Dominitz and PC Games senior editor Rusel DeMaria, the company cranked out a staggering number of strategy guide books over its thirty-year run. (The Prima Games brand still exists today, but primarily as a <a href="https://primagames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> that deals in guides and gaming news rather than a publishing imprint.)</p><p>Prime Games’ guide books for major games could sell extremely well. Prima’s <em>Myst</em> guide, for example, sold over 1.25 million copies. Not every strategy guide was a bestseller, but those that did hit it big made bank. There was a lot of money to be made if you published a guide for the right game.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I would... work like a dog for two weeks and get all the material I needed to produce the book.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The bulk of the Prima catalogue was written by the same dozen or so writers. Bart Farkas was one member of this content cabal and, by the time all was said and done, he had over a hundred published strategy guides to his name.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, Farkas remembers less about the games themselves and more about the travel and hours that were involved in producing them. In the present day, video game studios and publishers send game codes in advance to select websites, which publish their reviews and guides according to agreed-upon embargoes. But in the mid-to-late 1990s, game developers didn't typically want to send out advance copies of games to guides writers in this fashion; game publishers also saw the demand for guides as an opportunity to make some money on the side by selling the rights to the guide. And so, guide writers would embed themselves within the studio, playing the game ahead of time on-site. This meant that if Farkas had any questions, he could just walk over to the person in charge of a level or system and ask them.</p><p>“I travelled all the time to write these [guides],” Farkas told me. “I was at Nintendo in Redmond, Washington. Rockstar in New York City. Blizzard North in San Fran and Blizzard South in Irvine, California.”</p><p>“I would travel and generally [Prima] would pay to put me in a hotel and work like a dog for two weeks and get all the material I needed to produce the book,” he said.</p><p>This accelerated timeline often presented some practical issues. Games can change radically throughout the development process, especially during the lead up to launch. It wasn’t uncommon for Farkas to submit a strategy guide only to find that the final version of the game didn’t quite line up with what he had written.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a tendency for stats to be a little bit wrong because studios will often play-balance right up until the last minute,” Farkas said.</p><figure><figcaption>Myst (2021)</figcaption></figure><p>From Prima’s perspective, according to Farkas, an inaccurate guide that shipped on time was always going to be better than an accurate one that didn’t. One of the first things Farkas learned during his time working with the company was the importance of being at the right place at the right time.</p><p>“If the book isn’t there on the first day you lose 50% of your potential sales because people just impulse buy,” he said.</p><p>While Farkas said the official strategy guide rights for a given game could cost as much as half a million, the most expensive part of the production cost was usually the paper on which the books were printed.</p><p>Another business quirk of this era of games guide writing was that it wasn’t uncommon for game publishers to leverage the popularity of their bestselling titles during negotiations with parties like Prima Games. For example, Activision might only agree to sell Prima the rights to publish the official guide for an A-lister like <em>Call of Duty</em> if Prima also agreed to throw in a guide or two for less popular or lucrative titles.</p><p>The strategy guide industry’s boom period wouldn’t last forever though. Even at the time, Farkas saw the arrival of online-oriented titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em> as a tipping point for the somewhat precarious niche he was making a living from. Once people started using the internet to play games, it wasn’t long until they started using it to find out information about them. Before long, the writing was on the wall and the best game guides were found on sites like GameFAQs.</p><p>”People weren’t buying guides because they could just go online,” he said.</p><p>Farkas recalled when one of his game guides was scanned and uploaded in its entirety by a Korean fan. Eventually, the publisher of the game persuaded them to take it down by sending them free swag. Despite that resolution, Farkas couldn’t help but see it as a harbinger of the direction that things were going.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are many people out there and there’s always going to be one person who [is going to be] so obsessed with [a game] that they want to write their strategy guide for it — and they’ll do a good job…&nbsp; They’ll work for twenty-four hours a day for four days and get something out there and put a webpage up for it, and whatever they wrote is probably going to be a little bit better in terms of accuracy [than] what a print guide could be,” he admitted.</p><h2>Fewer page-turners, more page-views</h2><p>Paul Michael is a perfect example of this phenomenon in action. He’s been writing walkthroughs and guides for GameFAQs and Neoseeker since around 2006. At this point, he’s a veteran in the game guide space, with over 90 guides under his belt. To begin with, though, it was just an extension of the way he approached video games.</p><p>“I enjoy playing games and taking notes of certain steps and secrets, so I ended up enjoying the tedious process of taking my time playing while writing walkthroughs or taking notes,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>In a bid to get his name out there, Michael started posting his guides across several different websites. One of these was Neoseeker, where he ultimately became a paid contributor in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, Michael approached guide writing as more of a hobby. Much of his early work had a lo-fi style, being almost entirely text-based aside from the odd bit of ASCII art. This aesthetic wasn’t a creative choice as much as a function of the technology involved.&nbsp;</p><p>“Most guide writers started off with the text-based guides mostly submitted in GameFAQs — one of the oldest and most established gaming platforms out there. They have a character limit and only accept text files, so that formatting style kind of became the standard," he explained.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The issue was that things that used to be tied to cheat codes suddenly turned into micro-transactions or toys-to-life figurines. </p></blockquote></figure><p>While the rise of fan-written guides on the internet was an earthquake for the likes of Prima Games, the tremors of this trend were also felt by those working in the wider world of print media.</p><p>When James O’Connor first entered the industry in 2008, guides were already on their way out at gaming magazines aimed at older audiences. However, it was a different story for kids magazines like <em>Mania</em> and <em>K-Zone</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“For <em>Mania</em> — when I started in 2010, the games section had four full pages of cheats and guides. Back then it wasn't too uncommon for games to have cheat codes or passwords, especially games on handheld systems,” O’Connor said.</p><p>To fill those pages, O’Connor would scour GameFAQs and other websites for new cheats each month, although he often found himself veering more towards unlock guides as time went on.</p><p>“Nintendo games were good because they were putting out a lot of kid-friendly games that had big post-game unlocks, or features that were a bit hidden away. The absolute best, though, were LEGO games — I would get content for months out of those things. So many cheat codes for unlockable characters!”</p><p>When the magazines O’Connor worked on inevitably started to downsize their gaming sections, the cheat section was an easy place to cut. It didn’t help that filling those pages had become more and more difficult from the tail-end of the Xbox 360 generation era onwards.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</figcaption></figure><p>“The issue was that things that used to be tied to cheat codes suddenly turned into micro-transactions or toys-to-life figurines. I remember joking about doing a cheat page for <em>Skylanders</em>, but each character unlock was just ‘go and buy the associated toy,’” he said.</p><p>Even so, O’Connor felt like readers appreciated the information included in the section, which helped them get more out of their games. As Farkas predicted, it wasn’t long before he found himself looking to the internet for more than just filling out his slice of the magazine. In the years since his stints at <em>K-Zone</em> and <em>Mania</em>, he’s written more than a few game guides of his own.&nbsp;</p><p>The most popular one he ever wrote was an online guide to Eventide Island for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, written for a website called New Atlas. O’Connor lucked out in that his agreement with New Atlas would see him paid based on views. As a result, this one guide made him more money than every other one he wrote combined.&nbsp;</p><p>From his perspective, there’s a widening gap between the quality of the guide content he has produced in the past and the pages that turn up whenever he goes searching for answers nowadays.</p><p>“A combination between the hellscape of SEO and AI algorithms and the fact that every article needs to open with a long explanation of what the game is and a bunch of hyperlinks to different articles means that while we have access to infinite information, making that information profitable means obscuring it a little bit,” he said.</p><h2>How the SEO-sage gets made&nbsp;</h2><p>Nowadays, printed game guides have more-or-less entirely been replaced by digital ones. It’s no great secret that these sections are often the most <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-guides-help-video-game-sites-survive-the-modern-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular and lucrative</a> verticals within major gaming mastheads. But for as much as these guides emulate the utility of their paperbound predecessors, the conditions that underpin their production make for stark contrast.</p><p>Dillion Skiffington, a former senior guide editor at Fanbyte, described SEO-friendly guide content as the bread and butter of any modern medium-sized gaming website.&nbsp;</p><p>“Short of the major pillars like Kotaku, IGN, and the like where people will come straight to your front page, things like guides are the vast majority of traffic for most small to medium-sized websites,” he said.</p><p>While their popularity is constant, the amount of work that goes into a modern game guide can vary widely.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some guides are as simple as explaining basic in-game terms that pretty much anyone can find if they look it up in the game. For example, a list of all the new exotic armour pieces in <em>Destiny 2</em>, what they do, and how to get them. That may take just an hour or two. Other guides are much more complicated, like tier lists of all major characters from <em>Genshin Impact,</em> which really requires you to already have deep knowledge of the game, sometimes spanning hundreds of hours.”&nbsp;</p><p>Where Farkas’ guides were brought into existence by the whims of publishers and Michael had carte blanche, today’s guide writers sit somewhere in-between those two extremes.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>You have to keep up with the games even when you're not actively covering them because people can tell when you've lapsed.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Kerry Palmer, a freelancer who’s produced both written and video guide content for IGN since around 2020, said the appetite for guide content right now is as high as it has ever been. He doesn’t get to choose which games he produces guides for, but he does get to make a lot of them.</p><p>“The demand for the work is quite consistent, which I’m thankful for in an industry that has been plagued with layoffs, outlet closures and acquisitions for the last few years,” he said.</p><p>In addition to the steady paycheck, the other thing that Palmer enjoys about producing video guides is that he gets to flex all of his different skill sets at once.</p><p>“I’ve become better at script writing/editing, video capture, video editing, audio production, voice performance, video review, thumbnail creation and more as part of my work in this field, and I find that very rewarding,” he said.</p><p>For Palmer, the initial research process for written and video guides is largely the same, but the rest of the production involves a lot more steps, from recording VO to editing video to creating thumbnails that play nice with a particular video sharing platform. This larger time investment means that not even major outlets have the time or manpower to create a video for every single possible game or topic and that folks like Kerry have to be tactical about where they spend their limited time and effort.</p><p>That tension also exists at higher levels of the guide-making process. When it comes to picking and choosing which games are worth writing guides for, former deputy guide editor for Polygon Matthew Reynolds highlighted two factors: popularity and potential.&nbsp;</p><p>“The best games have a good mix of both: there being enough features or puzzles that readers will have trouble on, and having plenty of people playing and searching for help,” he said.</p><p>Reynolds said you can sometimes spot these key qualifiers ahead of time, while other times the process can be a little more trial and error. Sometimes the work on a given guide begins the minute a project is announced. In some cases, an alpha or beta test might be a good opportunity for an outlet to throw resources at a project and see what sticks.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might suspect, Reynolds noted that having access to code early often plays a role in determining which games get guides and which don’t.</p><figure><figcaption>Sea of Thieves</figcaption></figure><p>“If you can secure early code, it means you’re already publishing guides on release day, and are able to react to trends that you haven’t accounted for much easier. In other words, you aren’t scrambling to catch up.&nbsp;</p><p>“For the most popular games, you’ll likely write guides regardless of when you get access - your job is just more difficult if you don’t have early code - but for other titles, it can make the difference in wherever something is covered or not, especially if access lands during a quiet period,” he said.</p><p>Both Reynolds and Skiffington cited the rise of live service games as a key driver of change when it comes to how today’s game guides are written.</p><p>“Most ‘traditional’ games are one and done - you have a sprint of covering a game, and though you’ll want to tweak it post publish to target other keywords or add new advice, they are generally then left alone to become evergreen guides,” Reynolds said.</p><p>In contrast, launch day is just the beginning of the journey for live service titles like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>or<em> Marvel Rivals.</em> As a consequence, December has quickly become one of the busier periods for game guide writers, as the end of the year typically coincides with a slew of holiday-themed updates for live service titles.</p><p>“You have to keep up with the games even when you're not actively covering them because people can tell when you've lapsed or don't really care,” Skiffington said.</p><h2>A labor of love, with an emphasis on the labor</h2><p>This insider quality is critical to good guide writing but also incredibly difficult to fake. Sometimes, that means guide work tends to be paid better than other kinds of games writing.</p><p>“Behind the scenes, I think guides are usually valued correctly. Most people understand that guides usually pay the bills,” Skiffington said.</p><p>Unfortunately, this perspective isn’t universal. Lauren Rouse, an ex-guide writer with bylines on Kotaku, GameRant, and The Direct, said that — in her experience — the compensation for guide work often falls short of the work involved.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pay rates rarely take into account the behind-the-scenes work involved in writing a guide — you’ll often spend hours playing a game in your own time to then only be paid for the words you put down,” she said, adding that guides have often been looked down on in favor of more prestigious work like reviews or features.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is an element of personal value that comes from providing a service like a game guide, but I don’t think the art of guide writing always gets the appreciation it deserves from readers or brands,” she said.</p><p>Although Rouse noted that issues around money affect all areas of games journalism, she said that there’s a lot of assumed knowledge that comes with writing guides that deserves fairer compensation.</p><p>Of course, money has rarely been the only thing that drives people towards this kind of work. From the days of Farkas’ strategy guides through to modern content mills, the personal satisfaction that those writing guides derive from the work has always been part of the appeal. Guides are explicitly intended to aid players in a way that reviews, interviews or news content aren't. That ideal might be simple, but it’s easy to feel good about. It’s relatively easy to draw the mental line between the work that goes into making a game guide and the impact it’ll have when someone goes searching for the solutions contained within it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Destiny 2</figcaption></figure><p>Even as someone who has been working on game guides for almost 20 years, Reynolds still finds the work incredibly satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>“Having your hunches come together or being able to react quickly to what players are interested in - and knowing you’ve helped your audience exactly when they needed it - makes those challenging periods really pay off,” he said.</p><p>O’Connor sees modern guides as the media equivalent of quality assurance in game development.</p><p>"Guide writers are, fundamentally, heroic, doing tedious work in cursed conditions so that players can enjoy their games more.<strong> </strong>But getting those straightforward answers to your questions about a game often feels unnecessarily complicated," O'Connor said.</p><p>The impact that SEO optimization practices have had on the way guides are structured is the biggest difference between the guides Reynolds worked on when he began his career and the ones he touches nowadays. That said, he doesn’t believe this is necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>“I do think it’s better for readers to arrive at the puzzle solution they need quickly than making them scan a huge walkthrough or collection of puzzles, even if it does mean you sometimes cover a game in a more fractured way,” he said.</p><p>And for all the ire around how modern guides are structured, there’s a weird parallel to be drawn between the experience they offer and the one you’d associate with flicking through an old school strategy guide or calling up the Nintendo Power Hotline.&nbsp;</p><p>Walkthrough writers like Paul Michael usually give some consideration to those who just want to hit CTRL-F and jump straight to the information they’re looking for. Even Bart Farkas would be the first to admit that nobody reads his work like they would a traditional novel or nonfiction book.&nbsp;</p><p>“You just turn to the page with the information you need when you need it,” he says.</p><p>In a world where the impact of other types of games writing is murky or ambiguous, the value of a good game guide is straightforward and easy to parse. Perhaps that simple utility is why the practice of guide writing has endured.</p><p>As the tide of synthetic SEO-optimised slop rises ever higher, it’s hard to guess at what the future of game guides look like. Even so, it’s impossible to imagine a world where game guides are made without the effort, hours and humanity that every incarnation of the craft has embodied in one way or another.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/guides-writers]]></content:encoded>

<p>September is built for LEGO games it seems</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_voyagers">LEGO Voyagers</a> — the two-player co-op adventure from Light Box Studios, the developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_builders_journey">LEGO Builder’s Journey</a> — is coming to Switch on <strong>15th September 2025</strong> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lego-voyagers-official-release-date-trailer">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Originally announced at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/lego-party-gets-the-party-started-on-switch-this-september-physical-release-confirmed">Summer Game Fest Opening Night Live</a>, Voyagers joins the LEGO Party as the second Lego game to launch in September (technically first as it launches before the Mario Party-like).</p>
<p>Unlike Party, however, Voyagers is a co-op physics platformer where you and a buddy, who can play locally, online, or via a Friend’s Pass (like Hazelight's It Takes Two or Split Fiction, only one person needs a copy of the game), team up to discover what it's like to be a Lego brick,</p>
<p>And the game looks <em>just</em> like an actual collection of Lego bricks, but with an added dose of cute. Who knew Lego bricks could look this adorable?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/">Steam page:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of LEGO® Builder's Journey comes a new 2-player co-op adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<p>- Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
<p>- Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
<p>- Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
<p>- Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</p>
</blockquote>

These days you can just check the <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/en/games/">Windows on Arm ready</a> site to see which games run well.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758828/microsoft-windows-on-arm-xbox-app-download-feature]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Later this year, <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will end support on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One after eight years of service as the developers focus on improving the game on current-gen hardware.</p> <p>On August 13, the development studio behind the extremely popular online battle royale game <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> announced that the multiplayer shooter will no longer be playable on PS4 or Xbox One after November 13. The first console port of <em>PUBG</em> arrived in late 2017 on Xbox One and was followed by a PS4 port the next year. According to the team behind <em>PUBG</em>, sharing this news with players “weighs heavily on” the team.</p> <p>“This was not a decision made lightly,” said the <em>PUBG</em> team in a blog post sharing the news. “It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of <em>PUBG</em> Console. We kindly ask for your understanding.”</p> <p>The devs claim the reason for ending support on PS4 and Xbox One after nearly a decade comes down to the team wanting to improve the game’s performance, visuals, and stability on console. The team also knows players have long dealt with the game crashing and hope this new version of <em>PUBG</em> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 won’t collapse as often.</p>

 <p>Players on PS4 and Xbox One should be able to log into a new console and find all of their account progress and purchased items waiting for them. PS5 users will have to download a new version of <em>PUBG</em>. Meanwhile, on Xbox, the game will be updated automatically via Smart Delivery. The new version of <em>PUBG</em> will support 60FPS on all platforms, including Xbox Series S, though at a lower resolution on that device. (Players on Xbox’s weaker console can select a quality mode that runs at 30FPS as well.)</p> <p data-renderer-start-pos="9191">“This transition to current-gen consoles is not only aimed at providing a more stable environment, but also at preparing for larger updates in the future,” said the devs.&nbsp; “It marks an important step forward for the long-term growth of <em>PUBG</em> Console, and will allow us to respond more swiftly to the evolving needs of the console ecosystem. We sincerely thank you for your continued interest and support in <em>PUBG</em> Console, and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible gameplay experience going forward.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has provided players with details about the Resident Evil Requiem story, including the revelation that Grace’s mother is the woman monster. </p>



<p>The insider, Dusk Golem, has been on a roll lately, constantly providing players with details on everything Resident Evil. Recently, they revealed that Resident Evil Requiem gameplay details, which feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Last of Us’ combat and vehicles</a>. Now, the same insider has provided players with story details for RE9. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-the-last-numbered-game">Resident Evil Requiem is the Last Numbered Game</h2>



<p>AestheticGamer, also known as Dusk Golem, has posted a series of posts on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) regarding Resident Evil Requiem’s story. They first stated that Capcom will make Resident Evil Requiem the last numbered game, RE9 will not only be a conclusion chapter but also a new beginning for Resident Evil. Moreover, it will be the end of the timeline and the conclusion of “everything to do with Umbrella, Raccoon City, its legacy &amp; long history”. This move will enable them to implement significant changes to the franchise. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will also serve as the conclusion to everything that began with RE1, RE2, and RE0 (if players choose to include this game). The series will now introduce new characters, new types of horror stories, “without being tied down by the series history.” The team has faced several restrictions over the years, including tying all game elements to Umbrella, Raccoon City, and other locations. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/4) Here is how it's been conveyed to me, &amp; I've been saying this for 4-5 years now actually, but I was updated on this as recent as a couple months ago.</p><p>Resident Evil 9 they plan to make the last numbered RE game. RE9 is a conclusion chapter, as well as new beginnings for RE. <a href="https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn">https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the next series of <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955477988864299267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweets</a>, Dusk Golem revealed what he knows about Resident Evil Requiem’s plot. They recognize all the characters from the first trailer, which features the stalker monster, the hooded figure, and shadowy figures. They are also aware of the game’s framing device, the playable characters, and their roles in the game’s story, but not where their stories lead. The leaker also knows about the upcoming game’s central virus/infection, why they need Grace’s blood, and how everything ties to Umbrella. </p>



<h2 id="h-grace-s-mother-alyssa-is-the-giant-monster">Grace’s Mother, Alyssa, is the Giant Monster </h2>



<p>One significant detail about Resident Evil Requiem’s story that Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955484464915812717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> is that the giant monster woman is, in fact, Grace’s mother, Alyssa. The leaker states that many will figure this detail out with the Gamescom reveal and preview embargo. Dusk Golem adds that this isn’t a spoiler, as Grace figures out who the monster is shortly after meeting them the first time. Grace is an FBI Technical Analyst and can recognise their own mother. However, the situation initially makes her reluctant to believe it, but she quickly comes to accept it. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-isn-t-a-pure-horror-game">Resident Evil Requiem Isn’t a ‘Pure Horror Game’ </h2>



<p>When asked about Capcom’s recent comments that stated Leon “is a bad match for horror”, the insider <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955646403105243178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, noting it’s a “good thing” that “Resident Evil Requiem isn’t a pure horror game”. Golem added that the SGF reveal, the game’s press release, and other details have shown that Resident Evil Requiem will be a mix of horror and “high-stakes cinematic action.”</p>



<p>Regardless, all details mentioned above do not come from an official source, so readers should treat them with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>. Also, Resident Evil Requiem will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live. What are your thoughts on Resident Evil Requiem’s story details?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-clue-advent-calendar-is-a-murder-mystery-game-you-play-throughout-the-holiday-season.1269432/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a kid, we always had our own homemade version of an Advent calendar. It was a sort of tapestry that my mom had sewn together and she would drop little surprises in each pocket for every day of December. Now that I'm an adult with a kid of my own, this is a tradition I really want to continue with my son. Since my sewing skills are severely lacking, I've been really happy to see how much things have advanced in the Advent calendar market since my childhood. There's even a Clue Advent calendar now apparently, which seems like a cool way to make new holiday memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> is an interesting take on the tradition. Instead of a little treat each day, you get a new clue to help you solve a murder. It's something the whole family can partake in or you can enjoy on your own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets of Snowfall</h2><div catalogid="32ea85e6-204d-4404-a416-1d2010930fc2" id="226899"><div id="226899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets Under Snowfall</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala?</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This unique 2025 Advent calendar is now available to buy on Amazon for $29.99. According to the description for it, this game includes 24 days of clues and puzzles all connected to a larger mystery. The calendar itself opens up like a book to reveal a crime board and a map of the mansion. Players have to work together to unfold the mystery of who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala as each day as you open up each daily clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest downside of this game is that you'll only be able to play it once. Unlike other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> that you can pass to other friends or family when you're done, this Advent calendar can only be used during the 2025 holiday season. This is due to some parts requiring folding, writing, or cutting and you won't be able to return them to their original condition. So in that way it functions like any other standard Advent calendar.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clue Advent Calendar 2025 Images</h3></div></output></p><h3 data-cy="title3">The LEGO Advent calendars are pretty cool too</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for more Advent calendar options that aren't just candy, it's worth mentioning that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2025-lego-advent-calendars-where-to-buy">2025 LEGO Advent calendars</a> are now up for preorder as well. Each day includes a new build or minifigure that makes it a great gift for kids that will last beyond one season.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 13, 2025 4:32 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/clue-advent-calendar-board-game-2025-where-to-buy]]></content:encoded>

That means players can't face off unless they're on the same platform. The remake of the PlayStation 2 classic is slated for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Konami confirmed the lack of cross-play for Metal Gear Solid Delta <a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>, with GameSpot verifying the translation. While the game launches later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-will-add-a-hide-and-seek-based-multiplayer-mode-this-fall/1100-6533794/">Fox Hunt isn't set to arrive until this fall</a>.

Metal Gear Solid Delta will also feature Snake Vs. Monkey on PC and PS5 (which was part of the original Metal Gear Solid 3) and Snake Vs. Bomberman on Xbox Series X|S (which is a new mode). The game is set to come out August 28, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorder-restock-guide/1100-6524133/">the collector's edition recently restocked</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/">Hideo Kojima was asked whether he would check out the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake</a>.

              <p><em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> will once again be free for paid PS Plus subscribers to play when the hit open-world superhero adventure returns to the service later this month. In fact, August is looking like another decent haul for the Game Pass competitor, with<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em> and<em> Resident Evil</em> PS1 classics also joining the fray.</p> <p><em>Spider-Man</em> had originally been on the service’s subscription library until it was removed in April 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-marvels-spider-man-ps-plus-extra-ps4-1850328471">shortly before the sequel was released for PS5</a>. Originally going head-to-head with Microsoft’s Game Pass strategy, which included day-one first-party exclusives, it’s no longer a guarantee that Sony games will cycle into PS Plus library and stay there even years after they’ve released. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ps-plus-may-2025-gta-5-resistance-batman-1851778091"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> exited just last year ahead of its own remaster arriving.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">full list</a> of games joining the PS Plus Extra tier in August 2025:</p> <ul> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Sword of the Sea</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Indika</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Coral Island</em> | PS5And here’s what’s joining the Premier tier:</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> free game trial | PS5Everything will become available starting August 19, including <em>Sword of the Sea</em> which is a day-and-date release. It’s the latest atmospheric adventure from Giant Squid, which also made <em>Abzu</em> and <em>The Pathless</em>, one of the PS5’s more underrated launch games. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> has a lot of Journey-style dune surfing in it so I’m excited to check it out.There are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1m16p8q/games_leaving_ps_extradeluxepremium_on_august_19th/">notable games leaving PS Plus</a> on that day as well, however. <em>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</em> is ending its latest tour on PS Plus, and 2023’s excellent <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like <em>Wild Hearts</em> will be departing as well. <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>, <em>UFC 5</em>, <em>TopSpin 2K25,</em> and<em> Bugsnax</em> will all be gone as well.</li> </ul>

With no champions to call upon, it falls to the commonfolk of the town to face the unknown, confront whatever powers are to blame, and discover the secrets that are held within the crumbling walls. This is not a tale of heroes, this is a tale of those who do what they must to survive.</p><p><em>The Secret of Weepstone</em> is a dungeon-crawling RPG rendered entirely in striking hand-drawn black and white, an atmospheric love letter to the tabletop <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,458 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and art of the 70s and 80s.

<p>In my decades as a video game player and reviewer, I've used the humble PC mouse in hundreds of games for everything from first-person aiming and third-person character movement to basic menu navigation and unit selection. In all that time, I can't recall a game that required the use of two mice at once.</p>
<p>That was true until I spent some time with Nintendo’s utterly unique <em>Drag x Drive</em>. The game asks you to take a Switch 2 Joy-Con in each hand, turn them both so the narrow edge lies on a flat-ish surface, and then slide them around to power a game of full-contact wheelchair basketball.</p>
<p>It’s a fresh control scheme that comes with its share of issues, mostly stemming from the lack of convenient mouse surfaces in most living rooms. With a little bit of practice, a good playing surface, and some online friends to play with, though, I found myself enjoying the high-impact, full-contact, precision positional gameplay enabled by holding a mouse in each hand for the first time.</p>
<h2>Still kind of buff from using the mouse</h2>
<p>When you picture using two mice at once, you might imagine each wrist making a series of small, controlled movements, one controlling lateral movement and the other controlling directional angle. <em>Drag x Drive</em>'s dual-mouse controls bear no resemblance to this vision. Instead, you end up vigorously swiping each mouse forward or backward in constant sweeps; side-to-side movement is neither required nor useful.</p>
<p>That repetitive front-and-back swiping is mirrored by your avatar’s hand on the top side of either wheel on the wheelchair, creating a sort of tank-like control scheme where you turn by moving one wheel forward and one wheel backward. Small swipes of the mice can be used for precision angling, but more often, you’ll be sweeping the mouse in long lines to build speed. To shoot, you simply lift up a Joy-Con and mime a basketball shot a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/drag-x-drive-is-a-uniquely-fun-and-frustrating-showcase-for-switch-2-mouse-mode/%E2%80%9Dhttp://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2009/07/the-wii-is-born-again-ars-reviews-wii-sports-resort.ars%E2%80%9D"><em>Wii Sports Resort</em></a> (your accuracy seems to have more to do with distance and your angle to the basket than real-world form, thankfully).</p>

<p>That dual mouse movement system makes <em>Drag x Drive</em> a surprisingly physical game. I don't mean that in a virtual sense—even though bashing your wheelchair into the opposing team is your main form of defense. I mean your real-world shoulders and forearms will get a decent workout as you repeatedly make the huge backward and forward swipes to power your avatar up and down the court.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of physical mouse mileage required to play <em>Drag x Drive</em> outpaces even the most frenetic clickfests on the PC. It almost feels like a virtual reality game where you’re expected to tediously mimic real-world actions with one-to-one movements of your hands.</p>
<h2>Awkward in the best way</h2>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the <em>Drag x Drive</em> movement system is awkward in the best way—less <em>NBA Jam</em> and more <em>Rocket League</em>. The lack of easy lateral movement means you need to carefully manage your forward momentum and near-term path planning. Success in <em>Drag x Drive</em> is about constantly gauging not just your position relative to the opponents and teammates but also the angles they're facing, which determine where they're likely to go next and which paths may be clear.</p>

<p>The main missing element is <em>Rocket League</em>'s sense of verticality—jumping is limited to awkward bunny hops and runs up halfpipes on the edges of the court, meaning there’s little in the way of mid-air acrobatics or shot blocking. Instead, this is an ice hockey-style slide-and-bump affair; hitting an opponent from the side simply gives an annoying temporary jolt (which also disrupts their shooting motion) while hitting an opponent head-on forces a loose ball turnover and a mad scramble for the ball.</p>

<p>That kind of full-contact free-for-all is definitely most fun in an online setting, especially if you can join a GameChat session and talk trash with friends the whole time. In single player, it’s much less interesting to weave through bots that flip-flop dramatically between “almost immobile” and “god-level wheelchair-seeking missiles” depending on the difficulty settings. There are a few movement-honing solo mini-games to round things out, but overall, this is a game that will live or die by the size and quality of its online competition.</p>
<p>I can also see a pretty big skill-based gap developing in that online community. Quickly switching between long swoops to build up speed and small mouse adjustments to quickly change angles is a subtle skill that rewards players who can master it with smoother, faster traversal around opponents that can seem like they’re standing still. Those willing to put in the effort will find a high skill ceiling that rewards physical motor skills in a way few other games can.</p>
<h2>Where do I put these things?</h2>
<p>The most immediate problem with <em>Drag x Drive</em>’s dual mouse setup for most players will be where to use the mice when playing in their living rooms. I started out trying the mice on a flat, wooden lap desk I had handy, but the repeated, insistent thunking of the Joy-Cons on the hard surface quickly got annoying. I switched to swiping the Joy-Cons on the top of my thighs, but the irregular surface formed by my shorts fabric and/or hair-covered legs did not work all that well.</p>
<p>I had some more success laying the Joy-Cons on a large, upholstered ottoman, each repetitive swoosh mimicking the sound of corduroy pants rubbing against thighs. After a bit of play, though, my back started to hurt from leaning so far forward while constantly moving my forearms up and down.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The most comfortable control option I was able to find involved relocating my Switch 2 to my computer desk, where I plugged the dock into my HDMI-compatible monitor, moved my PC keyboard and mouse to the side, and used the newly available desk space as a sort of massive dual mouse pad. Here, I could play comfortably for extended periods, with enough surface area for precise control. I also tried swiping the Joy-Cons on the armrests of my computer chair, which felt pretty natural (and mimicked the positioning of the wheels on my avatar's chair).</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aDS3U27SSY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, even with this bespoke setup, I still had to deal with the discomfort of gripping the Joy-Cons. Unlike a computer mouse, which has a broad top surface to rest a controlling palm and fingers, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have an extremely thin edge in mouse mode. Getting a firm grip around that edge requires twisting your hand into a claw-like clutch on either side.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious discomfort, my grip never felt quite secure enough for the large, sweeping mouse movement required for a game like this. I would recommend plugging a pair of standard USB mice into the Joy-Con dock to fix this problem, but <em>Drag x Drive</em>'s reliance on motion controls for shooting makes this solution a non-starter.</p>
<p>If you can power through these mouse-related annoyances, though, <em>Drag x&nbsp;</em><span><em>Drive</em></span> is one of the more unique and fun action-sports games out there. I hope a critical mass of people give it a chance because I’d love to see some professional e-sports athletes madly swooping their Joy-Cons across a desk in a near-future Twitch stream.</p>
