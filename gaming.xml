Some of the negativity seems to be general dogpiling by players still upset over the base game, but there are a fair number of more reasonable people explaining why the DLC may be coming up short. Many hinge on the fact that aside from the story quest,<em> Shattered Space</em> is very light on other additional content, including more ship parts, weapons, armor, and other new features.<br></p><p>It’s clear <em>Shattered Space </em>is also burdened by the bar set by other massive single-player RPGs. Some players keep pointing to<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><em>Phantom Liberty</em></a></span>, CD Projekt Red’s similarly priced expansion for<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> last year that almost felt like a mini-standalone spin-off. Long-time Bethesda fans are also comparing <em>Shattered Space</em> to <em>Fallout 4</em>'s <em>Far Harbor</em> DLC , another expansion that offered a sprawling new areas to explore and some peak storytelling moments. </p><p> I’ve been playing <em>Shattered Space</em> all week and have a lot of thoughts but will hold them until my review is published. TL;DR: it’s complicated. And you can go on the <em>Starfield </em>subreddit and find plenty of fans who enjoyed the base game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are having a terrific time with the DLC</a></span>.

While there are certainly both good and bad things about <em>Shattered Space</em> worth highlighting, it’s clear the polarized reactions are in part a response to poor expectation-setting and hopes around the expansion not just adding to the game but also feeling fundamentally different from the familiar Bethesda RPG formula that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428">creaked and strained under the weight of<em> Starfield</em>’s ambition</a></span>.</p><p>This is far from the end of the road for the Xbox console exclusive though. In addition to stilly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805">maybe possibly coming to PlayStation 5 at some point</a></span>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Game Pass Day One Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This is in keeping with tradition for Activision and Nvidia, as 2023's Modern Warfare III also streamed through GeForce Now, as did the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta earlier this year. Call of Duty: Warzone is also available to stream through GeForce Now.</p><p>When Microsoft was in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, one of the sticking points was cloud-gaming rights. To appease regulators, Microsoft worked out a deal with Nvidia (and others) to bring future titles like Black Ops 6 to streaming services beyond Microsoft's own Xbox cloud gaming. Speaking of which, Microsoft is yet to confirm if Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox cloud gaming.</p><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2><p>GeForce Now is Nvidia's game-streaming service, and it's available throughout North America and Europe. Instead of needing a beefy rig or game console to play games locally, GeForce Now streams games from a powerful PC at Nvidia's server farm, running on GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs. Nvidia says those who subscribe to the highest, most expensive tier ($20/month) will get the best frame rates and visual fidelity, including ray-tracing. According to Nvidia, the experience is indistinguishable from playing locally--but of course that depends on the quality and consistency of your internet connection.</p><h2><strong>How to play Black Ops 6 on GeForce Now</strong></h2><p>First, you must own a copy of Black Ops 6 on Steam or Battle.net. Then, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a GeForce Now plan</a> and link your account. The cheapest plan is free, but it limits you to one hour of game time per day, has ads, and streams your game from a basic rig. The <strong>Priority </strong>membership ($10/month) gets you a premium rig with RTX on, priority access to servers, six hours of game time per day, up to 1080p/60fps, and no ads. Then there is the <strong>Ultimate </strong>package ($20/month) that streams from a RTX 4080 rig with exclusive access to 4080 servers, eight hours of daily game time, up to 4K/240fps, and no ads.</p><p>There are also Priority and Ultimate day passes available for $4 and $8, respectively.</p><h2><strong>Is Nvidia GeForce Now actually a good experience?</strong></h2><p>Given game-streaming technologies are relatively new, many might be wondering if GeForce Now is actually a good way to play Black Ops 6 or any of the other 1,500+ supported games. Reviews from sites like <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Mag</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-now-review-2023-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC World</a> are very positive about the service. Of course, though, your mileage may vary.

            <p>"Turn-based" games are, as we know, all derived from Turn, the strategy game about a dog digging for coins released for the BBC Micro in 1987. Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 
</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">turn-based RPG fest</a> featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is 40% reduced, Age Of Wonders 4 is 35% discounted, the recently released Tactical Breach Wizards is 10% off, Octopath Traveller 2 has been slashed by 40%, and XCOM2 is an absurd 95% taken-offed. I'll stop there because I'm obviously out of synonyms for "on sale".
</p>
<p>These genre specific Fests tend to attract fewer pre-release demos than other Steam events, particularly this close to the more demo-centric Next Fest, which happens in a couple of weeks. The most downloaded demos of the fest so far are recent releases such as Multiverse Loot Hunter and Backpack Battles, and recent-ish staples like Dragon Quest 11 S and the aforementioned Octopath Traveller 2.
</p><p>Still, browsing the menu did introduce me to Silence Of The Siren, which released in Early Access just a few days ago. It's from the developers of Project Hospital and it's a sci-fi strategy game in the vein of Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic. Looks neat! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/">grab the demo from its store page</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">Turn-Based Fest</a> runs from now until October 7th. Turn developer Stephen "Turn" Turner would be proud.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former Ubisoft game director, Rockstar Games game designer, and veteran producers in the industry have launched a <a href="http://d4nstudios.com/#GameDev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brand new studio</a>, Day 4 Night. </p>



<p>Mario + Rabbids game director Davide Soliani and Red Dead Redemption lead designer Christian Cantamessa are two of the more prominent co-founders of the studio. Also co-founding the studio are Chrtinia Nava, Luca Breda, and Glan Marco Zanna, all of whom worked as producers on franchises such as Star Wars, Ghost Recon, Mario + Rabbids, and Just Dance.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-former-ea-developers-form-the-three-thousands-studio-in-australia">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-ea-developers-form-the-three-thousands-studio-in-australia/">Former EA Developers Form The Three Thousands Studio in Australia</a></h6>



<p>The studio has secured funding from publisher Krafton as well as Xbox co-creator Ed Fries and is 1UP Ventures. Day 4 Night is already working on its first game that is being co-directed by Soliani and Cantamessa.</p>



<p>“What we are crafting at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player – joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends,” Soliani said via release.</p>



<p>“It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together.”</p>



<p>Soliani <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mariorabbids-creative-director-davide-soliani-exits-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Ubisoft in June</a> after 25 years with the company.</p>



<p>As far as the first game is concerned, it is based on a brand new IP from the studio. In the release, Fries says that what’s being worked on from the company is  “easily the most creative thing we have seen in quite some time.”</p>



<p>More details on the studio’s first game will come in the future.</p>

He's not in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/124199/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-featuring-the-legend-/credits/switch/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crypt of the Necrodancer: Cadence of Hyrule</a>, for instance, nor is he listed in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/150320/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/credits/switch/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> (though he is listed in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/68628/hyrule-warriors/credits/wii-u/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original Hyrule Warriors</a> as a special thanks). And Miyamoto is also nowhere to be found in either early CD-i Zelda game,  <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21133/zeldas-adventure/credits/cd-i/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zelda's Adventure</a> or <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21134/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon/credits/cd-i/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wand of Gamalon</a>.</p><p>But in all those cases, it's pretty understandable why the series creator wasn't especially involved. They were all developed entirely by outside studios, in genres and styles that are arguably not "core Zelda." But Echoes of Wisdom feels different. Even though it's co-developed by Grezzo, the outside studio worked in partnership with Nintendo EPD. And even though Zelda's the protagonist and the gameplay's a bit different, there's really no arguing that it's not a "mainline Zelda game" by every possible metric. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Rather, this seems to be further evidence of Miyamoto stepping back a bit from game development. Though he told us earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-isnt-retiring-anytime-soon">he's not retiring anytime soon</a>, Miyamoto has been more focused on "finding unique opportunities for Nintendo" such as the company's efforts in film and amusement parks. And we've seen further evidence that's happening as his role has diminished on other recent game projects, too. After <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/36620/shigeru-miyamoto/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years of being credited as a producer</a> on just about every major Nintendo game possible, Miyamoto's more recent credits on games like Princess Peach: Showtime! and Super Mario Bros. Wonder just list him as a "supervisor." It's indicative that he's increasingly handing the controls over to others at Nintendo.</p><p>GoNintendo also notes that Zelda veteran Takashi Tezuka was also seemingly not involved in Echoes of Wisdom, though Tezuka was not listed for Tears of the Kingdom, either, and seems to be similarly taking on a reduced role on the series in recent years.</p><p>Tezuka and Miyamoto's legacies on the series are going strong even if they're stepping back, though. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">gave Echoes of Wisdom a 9/10 in our review</a>, calling it "far more than some second-tier spinoff, combining the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D Zelda with the wild creativity provided by Tears of the Kingdom."

Since two of the three main modes are objective-based, you’re likely to run into multiple enemies simultaneously. The last thing you want to happen is to die as soon as you pull up. To combat this, always stay with your friends and push up together. This will increase your chances of surviving the bigger fights throughout the game.</p><h2 id="h23617"><a id=""></a><strong>Spawns reset</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s fun about <em>Space Marine 2</em> multiplayer is that it has old-school spawns—that means both teams will spawn on opposite ends of the current map. If you ever get spawn trapped, don’t worry, because as the game continues spawns will gradually reset to help combat this. But if you are the one spawn camping, keep this in mind, too.</p><h2 id="h23618"><a id=""></a><strong>Look up more</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Always take the time to look up while fighting. Because more times than not, you’ll find an Assault class up in the air, building up the strength to kill you. If they land, they’ll inflict enough damage to turn the tide of that battle.</p><h2 id="h23619"><a id=""></a><strong>Melee damage cuts through shields</strong></h2><p>One of the things that makes melee attacks so dangerous is that they ignore shields altogether. The second you’re hit with one, your HP will automatically be affected by this, and your shields will remain the same (unless you’re being shot at, too).</p><h2 id="h23620"><a id=""></a><strong>Find ammo boxes</strong></h2><p>Once you spawn in, you won’t be able to pick up ammo from fallen players. But it’s not all doom and gloom, because every map has ammo boxes scattered around. These won’t completely refill your ammo, but they’ll give you enough to get back into the fight.</p><h2 id="h23621"><a id=""></a><strong>You only get one grenade</strong></h2><p>Each time you spawn, you can only have one grenade at a time. So, if you plan on using it, make sure it’s worth it—you won’t be getting another one until you spawn back.</p><h2 id="h23622"><a id=""></a><strong>Spam your abilities</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In most online games, when shooters have special abilities, you need to be smart when using them. But that is not the case when it comes to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. You will be fully charged and ready to go the second you spawn in, to the point where you’re encouraged to run into battle with your ability activated—that’ll definitely help give you the upper hand.</p><h2 id="h23623"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s okay to give up ground</strong></h2><p>Now and then, you may find yourself stuck when trying to capture the objective, because the enemy team is holding it down. If that’s the case, giving up the objective is sometimes okay—this will give you and your team plenty of time to get to the next zone without much of a fight.</p><h2 id="h23624"><a id=""></a><strong>Be open to changing classes mid-game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in a game and make no progress. If you find yourself dying repeatedly, it’s probably a sign that you should change classes and try something new. Your current class just isn’t working right now.</p><h2 id="h23625"><a id=""></a><strong>Bulwark shields absorb a lot of damage</strong></h2><p>Bulwarks are extremely useful because, on top of being able to heal up teammates, their shields can absorb almost anything thrown at them, including grenades. This is great, especially if you’re trying to capture a zone. You can have them run up the field and take all the damage.</p><h2 id="h23626"><a id=""></a><strong>Learn melee combos</strong></h2><p>It’s crucial to take the time to learn the melee combos. If you and another enemy are going blow for blow, and you’re spamming basic attacks, they’ll win that fight every time. If you’re unsure of how to perform a combo, pause the game (not mid-fight, obviously!), and you’ll be shown which buttons you need to press.</p><h2 id="h23627"><a id=""></a><strong>Vanguard ziplines can be used to travel</strong></h2><p>The Vanguard zip attack can also be used to travel across the map. If you find yourself on the verge, you can easily escape with the zipline, and on top of that, it can also be used to reach harder places that you couldn’t get to otherwise.</p><h2 id="h23628"><a id=""></a><strong>Assault classes should never be on the ground</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Assault class has the quickest rechargeability rate out of all of them. This makes sense because their class is built around making aerial attacks. With that in mind, when playing Assault, you should rarely be on the ground, because you’ll have a low amount of armor and no useful skills.</p><h2 id="h23629"><a id=""></a><strong>Use the camera to your advantage</strong></h2><p>Use the camera angles to your advantage! Aiming the camera correctly allows you to look over certain areas without exposing yourself to the enemy. (No, not like <em>that</em>. Grow up.) It gives you the edge. (Stop it.)</p><hr><p>Armed with this information, you should start to get the upper hand when playing <em>Space Marine 2</em> multiplayer.

<p>Game streaming platform Antstream Arcade is the next company in the industry to suffer a round of layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/antstream-arcade-makes-small-number-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the company points to the “very challenging period” in the games industry as well as a “strategic shift” within the company as reasons for the layoffs.</p>



<p>“The games industry is currently facing a very challenging period,” the statement reads. “Due to a strategic shift in focus internally, we have made the difficult decision to make a small number of redundancies within the Antstream Arcade team.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly, and we will be working to support those affected throughout the process. Antstream Arcade remains dedicated to delivering the best possible experience to our players.”</p>



<p>“I have the sad news that I have been made redundant,” PR and communications manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246812630252752897/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Diane Hutchinson wrote</a> on LinkedIn. “I have enjoyed the time I’ve been with Antstream and appreciate everyone that welcomed me to the company.</p>



<p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-set-to-get-1300-classic-games-with-antstream-arcade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently launched on PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 4 in September. The platform brings over 1,300 classic games to players via a subscription service.</p>



<p>The number of employees affected by the layoffs is not yet known. As of writing, roughly <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 jobs have been lost</a> across nearly 150 companies in the games industry in 2024. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/bazzite-is-a-wonderful-steamos-ish-port-for-lots-of-non-valve-handhelds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>I was on vacation last week, the kind of vacation in which entire days had no particular plan. I had brought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">the ROG Ally X</a> with me, and, with the review done and Windows still annoying me, I looked around at the DIY scene, wondering if things had changed since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">my last foray into DIY Steam Deck cloning</a>.</p>
<p>Things had changed for the better. I tried out <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, and after dealing with the typical Linux installation tasks—activating the BIOS shortcut, turning off Secure Boot, partitioning—I had the Steam Deck-like experience I had sought on this more powerful handheld. Since I installed Bazzite, I have not had to mess with drivers, hook up to a monitor and keyboard for desktop mode, or do anything other than play games.</p>
<p>Until Valve officially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">makes SteamOS available for the ROG Ally</a> and (maybe) other handhelds, Bazzite is definitely worth a look for anyone who thinks their handheld could do better.</p>

      Bazzite says that you can swap an SD card full of games between any two systems running Bazzite. This kind of taunting possibility is very effective on people like me.

<h2>More game platforms, more customization, same Steam-y feel</h2>
<p>There are a few specific features for the ROG Ally X tossed into Bazzite, and the Linux desktop is Fedora, not Arch. Beyond that, it is like SteamOS but better, especially if you want to incorporate non-Steam games. Bazzite bakes in apps like <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a>, <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl">Heroic</a>, and <a href="https://www.junkstore.xyz/">Junk Store</a>, which Steam Deck owners often turn to for loading in games from Epic, GOG, itch.io, and other stores, as well as games with awkward Windows-only launchers.</p>
<p>You don't even need to ditch Windows, really. If you're using a handheld like the ROG Ally X, with its 1TB of storage, you can <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">dual-boot Bazzite and Windows</a> with some crafty partition shrinking. By all means, check that your game saves are backed up first, but you can, with some guide-reading, venture into Bazzite without abandoning the games for which you need Windows.</p>
<p>Perhaps most useful to the type of person who owns a gaming handheld and also will install Linux on it, Bazzite gives you powerful performance customization at the click of a button. Tap the ROG Ally's M1 button on the back, and you can mess with Thermal Design Power (TDP), set a custom fan curve, change the charge limit, tweak CPU and GPU parameters, or even choose a scheduler. I most appreciated this for the truly low-power indie games I played, as I could set the ROG Ally below its standard 13 W "Silent" profile down to a custom 7 W without heading deep into Asus' Armoury Crate.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luke-said-to-tell-you-about-my-mandolin.999909/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the end of yesterday’s Aftermath staff meeting, as we all said the things we were going to do afterwards–primarily having breakfast or dinner, depending on our timezones–I said I was excited to go play my new mandolin. Luke asked what a mandolin was, and as I revved up for my eager answer, he said to put it in a blog instead. So here we are.</p><p>I bought a mandolin! What is a mandolin? For starters, confusingly, it’s not <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-kitchen-mandoline-2216598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a food slicer</a>. Instead, it’s like if someone made a ukulele out of two violins. It’s a small instrument that for some reason has a copy of each of its four strings, for a total of eight strings you have to tediously tune and then somehow play together.</p><p>You’ll remember that I took up the <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ukulele</a> in February, after years of sucking at the guitar. I <em>love</em> the ukulele, whose size and approachability have opened up a world of cool new music styles and things for me to learn. The ukulele has a bit of a reputation for being a simple or limited instrument, though many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYhcN8p4yhg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtuosic</a> players have proven that untrue. While the things I haven’t learned how to do on the ukulele yet will last me the rest of my life, I did work my way to its edges by accident, by getting into bluegrass and Irish music on it.</p><p>The ukulele isn’t a common instrument in those styles, and while there are lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e5sR9klt48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr-ddFZVrtE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arranging</a> for them, it’s not quite up to the task. I went to some Irish and bluegrass jams, or group playing sessions, and while they were tolerant and even welcoming of me and my ukes, it was a bit of a forced fit. To play some of the cool tunes I heard, I’d either have to transpose their keys–which would mean I couldn’t play what everyone else was playing–or move around the fretboard in a way that became challenging and impractical. This is totally doable–there was a very talented banjo uke player at the bluegrass jam–but I started thinking how nice it would be to play an instrument that was more, well, normal. (Well, “normal.”)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Green Cake - Irish tune on banjo mandolin, written by Jonathan Berkahn" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GkG_GjArA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>We played this song at the Irish jam and I totally fell in love with it. You can see how on this guy’s banjo mandolin (an instrument I am not going to buy, I swear!) he doesn’t leave first position. When I tried to arrange it on my ukulele, I found myself moving all around the fretboard to work around the ukulele’s range and tuning. Not ideal.</figcaption></figure></div><p>So enter the mandolin: small enough to still have some of the qualities I love in the ukulele, but an instrument that suits the kind of music I’m excited to play better. It’s also an instrument my <em>actual</em> musician friends don’t wrinkle their noses at. After months of researching “best beginner mandolin” like a <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scammy SEO site’s</a> dream, and after biting the bullet on ordering an instrument <a href="https://www.elderly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online</a>, I spent all of yesterday staring out the window for the FedEx truck until my mandolin arrived.</p><p>There are already some, let’s call them, challenges. For one, since you have to play with a pick, it is very loud. This is bad because <em>jesus christ I am </em>awful <em>at it.</em> While I was immediately able to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5di4lbkStE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play</a></em> the ukulele, given its light strings and basic similarity to the guitar, the mandolin is just familiar enough to make me feel like I <em>should</em> be able to play it while being different enough that I can’t play it at all. Its design makes its weight weird and the instrument hard to hold. The fretboard is hella tiny even for my tiny hands, making it easy to hit the wrong notes and challenging to move between strings. Pressing two strings at once simply should not be a thing a person has to do. My goal last night was “make the right noise come out,” a goal I did not accomplish by the time I forced myself to put it away to not torture my neighbors. I’ve watched some people’s mandolin progress videos on YouTube and will admit to thinking “that’s <em>really</em> how you sound after four months of playing?” but oh no I get it now. This thing is tough.</p><p>This is all fine and normal and what learning an instrument <em>is</em>, especially when I’ve only had it for a few hours, but it’s definitely going to take a lot of practice to get to a point where I can even think about playing actual songs on it. It’s humbling to be so thoroughly bested, but also kind of nice: I can just worry about the very basics for now, knowing that once I have them down, there’s an exciting new world of music to explore. I am determined to never use<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tablature</a> on the mandolin, figuring out how to map my music-reading ability to a fretted instrument so I can use the wealth of <a href="https://thesession.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sheet music</a> out there instead of constantly googling “[song name]+tab.” And I’d like to focus on my scales and ear-training so I can actually play at the jams the way other people do.</p><p>So to answer Luke’s question of “what is a mandolin,” it is a bad but exciting choice I have made that hopefully neither I nor my neighbors will come to regret. It is another addition to the corner of my small apartment I call “the ukulele chair,” which is where I keep all my instruments and music. It is very pretty to look at and, so far, distinctly un-pretty to play. Once I’m better at it, hopefully it will be an excuse to get out of the house and meet new people. If you have tips for how I can stop sucking at it as quickly as possible, please let me know. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>So far, Blizzard has stayed quiet about the Diablo IV season which will go live alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a>, but that has now changed with the unveiling of Hatred Rising on the latest<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk2oJC-yX4Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-launch developer update live stream</a>.</p>
<p>The background story is that Mephisto's unbridled hatred has made manifest the Realmwalkers, colossal monsters that were so far just the subject of tavern tales. Upon spawning, Realmwalkers can threaten an entire region, spewing nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. Once charged, they will begin stalking the Region for sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect them during their wandering phase. Diablo IV players must kill them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker's health. When the Realmwalkers arrive at the ritual site, they'll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around him. Dismantle these quickly and make the Realmwalkers vulnerable before they gain too much power.</p>
<p>Blizzard has shared the spawning schedule, too. A Realmwalker will spawn in a region every 15 minutes, alternating locations each time. Once every hour, a second Realmwalker will spawn in Nahantu (the region of Vessel of Hatred), in addition to spawning somewhere in Estuar. Moreover, the first Realmwalker spawned each hour in Estuar will be a Whisper. Every three hours, the Realmwalker spawned in Nahantu will be a Whisper.</p>
<p>Upon defeating a Realmwalker, Diablo IV players will have to go on the offensive, leaping into the portal to the so-called Seething Realm. These are dungeons filled with monsters to slay and treasures to claim. Players must go through the dungeon to find the Realm Gate. Once there, they'll be presented with a choice of materials to offer. Select the Seething Opal you wish to receive as a reward for the dungeon's completion.</p>
<p>A Seething Opal is a new type of elixir that provides a 15% experience boost and other bonuses for 30 minutes. There are a total of 5 Seething Opals:</p>
<p>Seething Opal of Equipment: 25 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Materials: 5 Murmuring Obols<br>
Swirling Opal of Torment: 200 Sigil Powder<br>
Swirling Opal of Gold: 1 lump of iron<br>
Swirling Opal of Socketables: 3 Angel Breath</p>
<p>Note that the Seething Opal of Torment can only be obtained when playing on Torment Difficulty I or higher. Moreover, the Seething Opal of Socketables cannot be acquired unless you own the Vessel of Hatred expansion and play on Penitent Difficulty or higher in a Nahantu-based Seething Realm dungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Pre-launch Developer Update | October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rk2oJC-yX4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hatred Rising season of Diablo IV introduces a new quest from the Zakarum Remnants. Players can visit Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet, Hawezar, to start the Creeping Hatred quest, where they'll learn how to annihilate Realmwalkers and harness the arcane power of the Seething Realms to acquire useful Seething Opals. To begin this quest, players must have either completed the final quest in the base game's campaign—Legacy of the Horadrim—or opted to skip the base game's main questline. The Zakarum Remnants are also tied to a new Reputation system. Defeating Realmwalkers will help you improve your Reputation with this faction to get useful rewards.</p>
<p>With any new Diablo IV season, there's also a season journey and Battle Pass. This one starts on October 7 at 4 PM Pacific Time and hosts 90 Reward Tiers (28 Free Tiers and 62 Premium Tiers). The Smoldering Ashes earned from the Free Tiers can be spent on Season Blessings, which provide helpful bonuses in fighting back the armies of Hell. There are three new Blessings for Season of Hatred Rising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn of Opals: Increases the chance of receiving an additional Seething Opal reward after completing a Seething Realm.</li>
<li>Urn of Remnants: Increase the rate at which you gain reputation from the Zakarum Remnant.</li>
<li>Urn of Curiosities: Increase the chance of receiving a second item when purchasing from the Purveyor of Curiosities.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Getting the Premium Battle Pass will not only provide the rewards of the Free Tiers, but Soul Drinker’s Armor Set, Platinum, and more also await purchasers, including the Steed of Viz-Jun Present Mount, Curse of Viz-Jun Present Mount, and Ravenous Soul Mount Trophy, which unlocks at Tier 90. The Accelerated Seasonal Battle Pass also contains 20 Tier Skips and the Creeping Hollows Emote.</p>

The series has spanned over two dozen games and five timelines, but because the series is jumping between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-nintendo-breath-of-the-wild-timeline-1851637896">its codified continuities</a></span>, the three Triforce bearers are some of the only constants throughout most of the games. So what about all the weirdos and allies Link meets on all his different journeys and in all his different forms? Most of them only last for one game, but even as fans have left them behind with each new entry, they’ve left a lasting impression. Here are some of our favorite <em>Zelda</em> side characters from over the years.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-recommend-id="image://c26b7d1386b03b878f6272487505a5c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1597" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anju and Kafei hug it out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anju and Kafei are so beloved because of how involved the player must be in their lives throughout <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. The couple was meant to be married before Kafei disappeared, after being turned into a child by the mischievous Skull Kid. You spend entire in-game days trying to bridge the gap between the two lovebirds while one is too embarrassed to be seen in his cursed form. This includes delivering messages between them, helping them rebuild a bridge, and leaving them with hope that the curse can be lifted. Through all your efforts, the two are reunited and the credits imply that the curse has been broken and Kafei has returned to his adult form. Sadly, we never actually see him as an adult, as their wedding is shown from Kafei’s first-person perspective, but he seems to be much taller. Link’s an excellent wingman. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-recommend-id="image://67d839c5e911589c6953ec4221de835d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midna in Super Smash Bros." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Midna, the titular Twilight Princess, had some big shoes to fill as Link’s traveling companion after games like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>had solidified Navi as one of the most recognizable side characters in the series. At first, she is a sassy, demanding character who mostly accompanies Link as a means to accomplish her own goals. While she’s a manipulative opportunist for much of the early game, as Midna and Link grow closer throughout their journey, she’s unable to keep the facade up. Midna has a duty to herself and her people, but finds room in her heart for someone she originally viewed as just a tool to get her way. The gradual softening of her thorny exterior makes her one of the most rewarding characters to see through to the end.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-recommend-id="image://c7fa4e22363d477b74af56602a0919cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2693" data-height="1514" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Link sails on the King of Red Lions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mida and Navi are great, but easily Link’s best traveling companion over the years is the King of Red Lions. The dragon-like talking ship is intimately intertwined with every moment you spend in <em>Wind Waker</em>’s flooded version of Hyrule. He gets you where you need to go, provides meaningful commentary and perspective, and is a constant shoulder to lean on during the darkest times. His friendship with Link is the heart and soul of <em>Wind Waker</em>, but it grows into so much more, as it’s revealed that he is actually the long-lost king of Hyrule. He has watched his kingdom fall throughout <em>Wind Waker</em>, and though he’s haunted by its past, he does all he can,to help guide it to a better future. As an ally to Link, he is without peer. As a symbol of the cyclical nature of <em>Zelda</em> series seeking to free its heroes from the lives they’ve been forced to relive, he is a memorable figurehead within the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-recommend-id="image://5673f1535bb360242593fd05db860ee3" data-format="jpg" data-width="812" data-height="456" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groose points at Link." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Link’s rival in the Wii’s <em>Skyward Sword</em> is a delight. He gives big “dumb jock” energy in the game’s early hours, seemingly out of jealousy that Zelda fancies our hero more than him. But watching him go from a bully to a hero himself is one of the highlights of the divisive, motion-control-driven game. He’s a source of drama, levity, and humor, but he also has a lot of heart to go along with it. Groose makes a meh game better.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-recommend-id="image://05bb14e02c7f14793d53114b898f79ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Champions take a group photo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every time you learn about the Champions in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it feels like a gut punch. These memorable heroes are all gone by the time you get to know them, and each of them had their own hopes, dreams, and responsibilities as they fought to protect Hyrule from Calamity Ganon’s destruction. Every memory you find in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is tinged with melancholy as you see the gusto and vigor the Champions had in their hearts as they prepared to fight the Calamity just for them be stomped out in its wake.</p><p><em>Breath of the Wild</em> is full of tragedy, but just because the Champions were defeated doesn’t mean their wishes have been completely wiped away. Link takes pieces of them with him when he remembers their time together and when he uses one of their abilities to defeat Calamity Ganon. Their hopes live on in the people still here, and by the end of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s thanks to them that the day is won. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Game Rant</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-recommend-id="image://f5cc065718c19a6c70db1f7cd0927b6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beedle carries his wares on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo has etched Beedle’s voice into the minds of millions. The recurring shopkeeper who first debuted in <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> has appeared in several games over the past 20 years, and his exuberant and expressive sound bites have been a backdrop of so many rupee transactions that they’ve taken on a memetic life of their own. Who among us doesn’t still hear his excited “thank you!” in their head from time to time? Beedle has persisted throughout the years, and is even a shopkeeper in <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. As a traveling salesman, he’s seen some shit now, and his hollerin’ has only gotten louder.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-recommend-id="image://3a377e5819580f7d27a64692c73c375c" data-format="jpg" data-width="770" data-height="432" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tingle in Hyrule Warriors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of flamboyant recurring characters, Tingle hasn’t been around lately, and I’m torn on whether that’s a relief or a shame. The <em>Zelda </em>series’ most recognizable little freak started out as a map salesman in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, then went on to be one of the few characters that persists through multiple games. He’s known for his excited, obnoxious behavior, nickel-and-diming Link at every turn, and for the way Nintendo keeps putting him in games even though no one really likes him.</p><p>This little king got his own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fans-have-finally-translated-the-most-recent-tingle-gam-1821755765">spin-off series during the DS era</a></span>, though the games never made their way to the States. Honestly, kudos to him for sticking around even when people were mad about him. I have to give flowers for persistence. Though his appearances have been fewer and farther between as years have gone on, he’s still a mainstay of the extended <em>Zelda</em> universe in things like <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-recommend-id="image://06fed18f5d058f38bbbc9e9d0ed2e9c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Navi talks to Sheik and Impa." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like Tingle, whether or not someone thinks Navi is annoying or a staple of the <em>Zelda</em> franchise depends on who you ask. The fairy is Link’s traveling companion in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, and her catchphrase “Hey, listen!” is embedded in gaming culture—someone you know has that as their text tone on their phone, while others would probably roll their eyes if they heard it. As her name implies, Navi is your navigator, your right hand, your blabbermouth friend you wish you could mute. But she’s also a trailblazer for characters like her throughout the series and one of the most memorable companion characters in all of video games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-recommend-id="image://c9e81036ac96ebc28538bbe4983464f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A great fairy rises from the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Great Fairies have appeared in multiple<em> Zelda</em> games, but their depiction in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is one of my favorites. The giant women in flashy hair and makeup that would make anyone competing on <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> jealous are fun, flirty, and always willing to lend a helping hand— if you help them first. Most design iterations of the Great Fairies have been a bit more reserved, which is why the <em>Breath of the Wild </em>versions are a delightful return to the maximalist look of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>’s fairies. Don’t give me generic fairies who will heal me up. Give me drag queen-looking mothers who are here to slay the pain away.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-recommend-id="image://77d6acdf56ba288814e92314bf143527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Impa as she appears in Breath of the Wild." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of all the recurring characters in the <em>Zelda </em>series, Impa is likely the one who has gone through the most wildly different interpretations since her debut in the original game. She’s been a non-combatant elder and a ninja-like bodyguard, but every time she and Link meet she is a source of wisdom and direction. Depending on when you jumped into the franchise, the name “Impa” might conjure a different image in your mind. I still remember her most vividly as the Sage of Shadow in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, but it’s not lost on me that many will know her as an elder in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s Kakariko Village. But no matter which version of her you remember most, her presence as a guiding hand transcends timeline and appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-recommend-id="image://8a49508c55950fa6ce7cfcb2edb94427" data-format="jpg" data-width="256" data-height="240" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Error says &quot;I am Error.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Error is a man of few words.

Then if you talk to him again he’ll tell you about a tunnel that leads you to a whole new area you might not have found in the game. Thanks, Error!

You don’t even want to be sitting next to him at the Disney ranch.”</p><p>Jones and Smith had apparently both just gotten seated and strapped in for the cameras to begin rolling when the latter beefed. “I hear Will Smith go, ‘Oh, Jesus, so sorry. Tommy, so sorry. Baz, get the ladder,’ Sonnenfeld recalled. “And you hear Tommy saying, ‘That’s fine, Will. No worries, Will. Don’t worry, Will.’” The set apparently had to be “evacuated” for over three hours before filming could resume. “He’s a lovely guy, just he farts,” the filmmaker said. “Some do, some don’t.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remakes-leaked-ending-hints-at-possible-sequel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Until Dawn Remake is not out until October 4, 2024; however, a day before the intended release date, the game’s ending has leaked, which hints towards a sequel.</p>



<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead for players who haven’t played the original game.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1fus4m8/leak_new_ending_for_until_dawn_remake/">untildawn</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">Eurogamer</a>), Until Dawn Remake developers have added an entirely new ending that paves the way for a sequel. In the original game, players could only reach two conclusions: either Josh dying or him turning into a Wendigo. However, in Until Dawn Remake, the developers have added an entirely new ending, where Josh survives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Until Dawn Remake ending plays right after credits, and Dr. Hill addresses Josh, stating, “But it is a game that has driven you to one of your own deepest fears, Joshua. Isolation.” The scene ends with Joshua showing the massive scar on his forehead while Dr. Hill says, “I hope for your sake, Joshua, that you can find redemption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Until Dawn Remake ending has an additional post-credit scene, where players see how Sam deals with PTSD some years after the game’s events. The scene begins with Sam asleep, and an alarm wakes her up. As she goes to stop the alarm, she finds her arm covered in blood, with someone knocking at the door. The scene ends with a mysterious voice calling her name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reliable insider has also weighed in on Until Dawn’s sequel. Shpeshal Nick has taken to <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1841831653859328287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to provide more information about the game. According to him, Firesprite will be developing the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

And while gamers were largely charmed by the father and son bond that they forged, Atreus was a little overly chatty. That trend continued in the 2022 sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/" data-ref-id="1900-6417993">God of War Ragnarok</a>. But now, a new mod has been created for the recently released PC port that keeps Atreus and other companions from stepping all over the game's puzzles.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod-turns-off-all-companion-puzzle-hints" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a NexusMods user, Mophead01, has released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/66" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Please Shut Up mod</a>. This expands on Sony's previously released option to decrease the frequency of hints for the puzzles that Kratos has to solve throughout the game. Mophead01 felt that did little to address the actual problem, including recurring instances where Atreus reminds gamers how to perform basic actions. Thus the mod has taken the drastic step of removing over 1,500 lines of dialogue from the game.</p><p>"Tired of companions telling you things you already know? Tired of the game treating you like a child if you don't instantly solve every puzzle? This mod removes over 1,500 pointless, [patronizing] voice lines from the game," wrote Mophead01.</p><p>Unfortunately, this mod is not an option for gamers who have Ragnarok on PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4. Sony hasn't even gotten around to sending out an update for those versions that includes the PC option to cut down on the hints. So for now, only PC gamers have the chance to keep Atreus quiet for any extended length of time. </p>

		<p>A major game set in the Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra universe is being developed by Saber Interactive, the studio has confirmed today. The new game will be a triple A action RPG set in the same universe, but it will not follow either Aang or Korra. Instead, this game will be set thousands of years before either of their stories, introducing a new Avatar that has not been seen in the show.</p>
<p><em>“We know loyal fans of&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>: The Last Airbender&nbsp;have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world- building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,”</em> said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. <em>“Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</em></p>


<p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. <em>“Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the&nbsp;<span>Avatar</span>&nbsp;Legends&nbsp;universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon.”</em></p>
<p>Saber Interactive will be working with Avatar Studios to create a story and world which will fit into the lore that has been established by the two shows already, and it will follow a familiar pattern of being a story about an Avatar trying to master all four elements. The game’s description also seems to suggest that there will be choices that will have an impact on the story, and that this Avatar will have their own group of companions too, just like Aang and Korra. No platforms or release date has yet been confirmed.</p>

			<p>Sid Meier's <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/">Civilization VII</a> is the next game to be announced in the Civilization franchise, a beloved franchise that has been going since 1991, with multiple spin-offs in the franchise. The next main game in the franchise was announced during Summer Games Fest 2024 and is slated for a 2025 release. As of today, the official system requirements have been announced, and the Ultra settings are asking quite a lot of players. At the moment, there have been no Mac requirements listed, so it's uncertain whether the game will be arriving on Mac as it releases on PC, if it'll come at a later date, or if there are no plans to put it onto Mac at all. Civilization VI was put onto Mac and Linux, so it's likely that the game will also be released on Mac at some point in its lifespan. Below are the PC system requirements for Civilization VII, as <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today on X</a>.</p>

<p>While the lower settings are quite reasonable, as are the recommended settings, dedicated fans in the comments are already posting their shock at the intense requirements for the ULTRA settings. Typically, Civilization games aren't that hardware intensive, and players can still run the game on great graphics without their hardware running hot. However, it seems that Firaxis has a different idea for this game.</p>
<p>However, considering that the ultra settings will allow the game to run at 4K60, it seems relatively reasonable that an RTX 4070 would be the recommended graphics card for those who want the utmost graphic fidelity in their 4X experience. Some have been quick to come to the defense of Civilization VII's system requirements, saying that they are justified, but some are saying that it seems unnecessary to need a 4070 for a turn-based game.</p>
<p>At the moment, details about Sid Meier's Civilization VII are quite slim, as the game was only announced earlier in the year. However, as we get closer to 2025, more details about upcoming features and perhaps information about why the system requirements are what they are are bound to be released.</p>
