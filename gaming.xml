            <p>David Gaider has shared his thoughts on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s romance options.</p>
<p>Gaider, who is the creator of Dragon Age and lead writer on the series' previous instalments, offered up a lengthy thread on social media platform X where he compared the romance approach to the popular Baldur's Gate 3. </p>
<p>"I guess the move in [Dragon Age: The Veilguard] to 'all companions are romanceable by everyone' isn't a huge surprise, considering [Baldur's Gate 3], but - unsurprisingly - I have a few thoughts," he <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421129502118278">began</a>, before acknowledging the "fandom is pretty split on romance design".</p>

<p>Gaider said a large portion of the game's community want the option to romance anyone and everyone, and therefore felt not getting to do so is "tantamount to a slap in the face". Others, however, prefer "characters with more agency, even (and maybe especially) if it doesn't align with their preferences".</p>
<p>The developer did not come down on either side being right or wrong here, merely stating "it depends on what you want from the game" and "we're not all here for the same reasons, ok?". He added the "only unfortunate aspect, in my experience, is that these two approaches are more or less diametrically opposed, from a design standpoint".</p>
<p>The previous Dragon Age writers realised once a character became romanceable, it limited the stories that could be told with that character, as they became "beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing", said Gaider.</p>
<p>"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band," Gaider furthered. </p>
<p>This is why players were unable to romance the series' dwarf companion Varric in previous entries. "Already I hear some fans groaning in disappointment, even though we did it so as not to *destroy Varric's character*. You can't have it both ways, I'm afraid," Gaider said.</p>
<p>He added that Dragon Age: The Veilguard's approach to romance being described as new was "curious", considering the "only difference between this and [Dragon Age 2], after all, is that not every [Dragon Age 2] follower was romanceable".</p>
<p>"The ones you could were pansexual. In fact, we made the *same* argument that they were not 'playersexual' (ugh)," Gaider said. "The call to back away from that approach in [Dragon Age Inquisition] was mine, made with Mike's and the team's support. I didn't like what taking away the followers' agencies did, that it turned them into sex dolls whose only purpose is to have the player mash them together and go 'now kiss!'"</p>
<p>Gaider admitted this was a "personal (and uncharitable) preference", before adding he also wasn't a fan of what it did for the characters in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>"Several characters would have had a stronger arc without romance, and the feeling I got from having this entire huge crew all ready to drop trou if I blinked wrong... meh," he said.</p>
<p>However, despite acknowledging he isn't the biggest fan of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's approach to romancing characters, he thinks it "should be fine" if the developers "unapologetically lean into it", much as Larian did with Baldur's Gate 3. "It's a legit approach, like I said, and many many fans will be gleeful and happy for it," he said, "which, at the end of the day, is not a bad thing."</p>

<p>What's more, if you don't romance a character in The Veilguard, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-romance-characters-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-theyll-find-other-partners-for-themselves">they'll find another partner for themselves instead</a>.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801425282223772043">post</a>, which I will admit made me chuckle, Gaider said he was going to refrain from sharing any more thoughts on Dragon Age: The Veilguard for the time being. His reason? Because he doesn't want to "provide fodder for news articles that like to talk about what 'former Dragon Age lead writer' tweets".</p>
<p>Sorry, Gaider, we can't help it - we find what you have to say interesting, and so do our readers!

<p>For more, our Chris Tapsell went hands-on with Dragon Age: The Veilguard earlier this week, and he was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-story-mode-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-story-mode-%E2%80%98not-happening-sorry-bro%E2%80%99.901419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-story-mode-not-happening/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Helldivers 2 is still proving to be a successful game since being released globally in February 2024. It became something of a cult sensation, with millions of players pouring into the game that was released on PlayStation 5 and PC at the start of the year. It was regarded as an overnight sensation, offering unparalleled multiplayer-fuelled entertainment and constant updates from Arrowhead Studios, the game’s developer. </p>



<p>Recently, the topic of a Helldivers 2 story mode came up again. It’s not present in the game, and given the most recent sentiment, it’s highly unlikely it’ll ever wind up becoming a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sorry-bro">‘Sorry Bro’</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/MrFreeeez/status/1801310524484763678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitter</a>, one hopeful user probed the CEO of Arrowhead Studios, asking if the team could create a story mode for the game ‘with epic moments and tragic scenes’. Unfortunately for those still holding out hope that a deeper narrative will find its way into Helldivers 2, the CEO of Arrowhead responded with a definitive statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Not happening. Sorry bro. That’s like building an entirely new game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 <strong>can </strong>be played solo, but it’s currently not recommended owing to the crushing difficulty of the game and the inherent challenges it presents. It was built for team-based play, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Like a story mode, it seems unlikely that Arrowhead Studios will ever implement a solo-exclusive mode to the game, as that would require re-writing how the game behaves and how combat works, and it’s a question of whether the investment is worth the reward.</p>

        <p>The GamesIndustry.biz team selects their favourite indie titles from the past week that deserve more attention</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A number of headlines on other sites have declared this year's array of showcases as 'The Year of the Indie' – and they're not wrong.</p>
<p>The titles seen across the likes of Guerrilla Collective, Wholesome Direct, and Day of the Devs were superb, with dozens if not hundreds of titles from smaller or solo developers bringing original and innovative ideas to the table, or telling stories from underrepresented cultures, or simply tapping into a sense of fun and imagination that few AAA titles manage with their push for realism or intense action.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/our-favourite-indie-games-from-the-2023-summer-games-showcases">As with last year</a>, the GamesIndustry.biz team wanted to highlight some of the titles we deserve more time in the spotlight at a time when most of the attention goes on the latest outing from established developers and franchises. Below are our picks from the summer games showcases of 2024.</p>

<h3>Christopher Dring, Head of GamesIndustry.biz</h3>
<p>I was very privileged to be out in LA during the period of summer games showcases, so I couldn't watch every one of the seemingly endless announcement videos that were put on. Apparently there were over 700 games shown, with 70+ games announced in a few of the events... There's the games industry's discoverability problem represented in a single weekend.</p>
<p>But while I couldn't watch all the videos, I was able to play a couple of the games. And there were two that I want to call out.</p>
<p>First is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959390/Fear_the_Spotlight/">Fear the Spotlight</a> by Cozy Game Pals, and being released under the new Blumhouse Games label. It's a game that looks like it was made in the late 1990s, with flat faces and low polygons, but doesn't play like one (thankfully). The demo portrays two friends, Vivian and Amy, as they sneak into a school to grab a Ouija board from the library and conduct a séance. Things go wrong, Amy disappears, and the world goes all Silent Hill.</p>
<p>The opening segment we played involved dodging school security cameras, finding a key to a locked door (Resident Evil-style), and then fleeing from an encroaching fire. The best part was the sound, which really ramped up the tension, with the wind and rain battering the windows outside and the footsteps echoing around the deserted school. The experience felt like a cross between Goosebumps and Silent Hill, which is right up my alley.</p>
<p>Sticking with the theme of game publishers who aren't traditionally games publishers, I also popped over to Netflix's chilled room at Play Days to check out its line-up. There was a lot of interesting stuff here, but the one that fascinated me the most was <a href="https://www.theoddgentlemen.com/games/harmonium">Harmonium: The Musical</a>.</p>
<p>This is a sign-language puzzle game for mobile, and I played through a series of fantastical challenges where I had to convey or receive information without the benefit of sound. It was a delightful game by The Odd Gentlemen, and written by Matt Daigle. The game is inspired by some of the communication challenges that Daigle, and other deaf and hard-of-hearing people, have encountered. It was accessible, educational and fun and clearly a lot of love had gone into making it. It will be available to Netflix and Game Pass users, so hopefully a lot of people will give this one a go.</p>

<h3>Marie Dealessandri, deputy editor</h3>
<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same: my favourite indie game from the showcases this year is one I <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/our-favourite-indie-games-from-the-2023-summer-games-showcases">already mentioned last year</a>: Neoludic Games' Tiny Bookshop is (still) sky high on my Steam wishlist and seeing it again at this year's Wholesome Direct was a joy.</p>
<p>While I wait for its 2025 release, being able to play the demo has been such a treat; gorgeous art, lovely writing, management aspects more advanced than I anticipated, plus the arduous task of recommending real-life books to customers… Sign me in, I'll be there in 2025, Tiny Bookshop!</p>
<p>But looking at new games that clicked with me this year, three really hit the spot: While Waiting, Winter Burrow, and Wanderstop. (The fact they all start with a W is pure coincidence, but I love an alliteration moment.)</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is the latest project from Stanley Parable developer Davey Wreden, under his new studio Ivy Road. While this debut trailer initially lets you think this is just your typical cosy sim, it comes with a twist as lead character Alta deals with the complicated feelings stemming from her life changing from fighter/adventurer to tea shop employee.</p>
<p>Wanderstop looks like it'll tackle the paradoxical emotions of missing a life you don't have anymore even if you were happy to leave it, with some anger bubbling up in there that could lead to interesting gameplay and narrative. Either way, it was definitely my most favourite trailer of all the showcases and I can't wait to unravel this one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">Winter Burrow</a> describes itself as a "cosy take on the survival crafting genre," and appealed to me immediately due to its art style; it reminded me of illustrated books I read as a child and it instantly felt homely. The debut title of Pine Creek Games, it's expected to launch early next year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Optillusion's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2449160/While_Waiting/">While Waiting</a> is my pick of the year when it comes to silly ideas that I'm so happy exist. I'm both very impatient and a completionist so a game where I have to wait to win? Excited to see my two personalities clash, bring it on!</p>

<h3>Sophie McEvoy, staff writer</h3>
<p>It may come as a shock to many, but there are games outside of Remedy that I want to play this year (... I say as I start my eighth playthrough of Alan Wake 2). There were plenty of indie games that piqued my interest during Summer Game Fest, and a dozen or so that went straight into my wishlist. But there were three titles in particular that I'm itching to play.</p>
<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582320/Mixtape/">Mixtape</a> was the one that caught my eye the most, and can't come soon enough. A game with nostalgic vibes built around my favourite music coupled with skateboarding and a two-step animation style? Sign me up. And while it's said to be inspired by coming-of-age films of the '80s and '90s, the trailer makes it feel like its own thing which is refreshing to see.</p>
<p>There were a couple of games that pulled on my heartstrings, none more so than Nomada Studio's side-scroller <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420660/Neva/">Neva</a>. The art style is gorgeous, and the idea of raising a wolf pup to become a forest deity has major Princess Mononoke vibes – especially with the heavy environmental storytelling. The art style took my breath away, and it's an adventure I can see myself being immersed in for hours and an emotional wreck by the end of it.</p>
<p>Lifeline Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1803140/Deer__Boy/">Deer &amp; Boy</a> also carries a similar tone, in which you play as a runaway young boy who meets a fawn that he tames to become his loyal companion. I can almost guarantee I will be crying my eyes out at that one, too.</p>
<p>One game that took me by complete surprise was Beyondthosehill's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1810670/Albert_Wilde_Quantum_PI/">Albert Wilde: Quantum PI</a> – not only in it being a game that truly encapsulates the film noir aesthetics I love, but that you play as an anthropomorphic cat. It's bizarre and absurd (in a good way), and hits the noir tones effortlessly. The gameplay also looks interesting, that being from a first-person perspective when walking around the streets of the city on the prowl for clues.</p>

<h3>James Batchelor, editor-in–chief</h3>
<p>Choose standout indie titles was even tougher this year, but there were two from Day of the Devs that really grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>First up was Crescent Moon Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2805070/Screenbound/">Screenbound</a>, a first-person puzzle platformer... although perhaps that's underselling what this game really is. As the player character explores 3D environments, they are also navigating a 2D version of their surroundings on a Game Boy-like device simultaneously. Objects and obstacles that appear on this device might be invisible in the 3D world, so you're essentially playing two games at once.</p>
<p>You have to see it in action to understand how it works (and even then, I imagine you need to play it to fully grasp the concept), but the idea is absolutely genius. Already I'm filing it away in my brain with Portal and Viewfinder; seminal titles that really make you think differently about how you're traversing your environment, the video game equivalent of thinking fourth-dimensionally. This is a day one purchase for me.</p>
<p>I'm a sucker for anything to do with time travel, so there was no way I was going to miss Soup Island's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052710/Hello_Again/">Hello Again</a>, a top-down adventure that solo developer Dwight Davis described as "game about being trapped in the worlds cosiest time loop."</p>
<p>You play a postal worker raccoon (I'm pretty sure it's a raccoon) who delivers a package to an island, only to discover the island is stuck in a 12-hour time loop that affects everything from the tides to the weather. Only by exploring the island, solving puzzles and getting to know the natives will you work out how to escape. The hand-drawn art style is beautiful, but it's the free-form structure and island setting that appeals to me. This comes across as a wonderful mash of Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening (two of the best Zelda games), minus the dungeons and combat. Very much looking forward to this one.</p>
<p>Finally, a shout out to Magic Rain Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1560160/ILA_A_Frosty_Glide/">Ila: A Frosty Glide</a>, which was shown during Wholesome Direct. Emanating similar delightful vibes to the wonderful A Short Hike, this follows a young girl who wants to become a witch and explores on her island home on a skate broom. A broom you skate on through the air. What more do you want?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yars-rising-stretches-its-ties-to-the-atari-classic-but-somehow-kind-of-works.901410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/yars-rising-stretches-its-ties-to-the-atari-classic-but-somehow-kind-of-works/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yars-rising-stretches-its-ties-to-the-atari-classic-but-somehow-kind-of-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="375" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Yars Rising </em>was recently <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yars-rising-is-coming-this-year-doesnt-look-very-yar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as a follow-up of sorts to Atari 2600 classic <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>. Rather than taking the form of a Zorlon Cannon-blasting shooter, <em>Yars Rising </em>is a hacking-centric Metroidvania with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2534370/Yars_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> now live during Steam Next Fest. As odd as the concept is, after playing some of what WayForward has in the works, I’m willing to hear them out.</p> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">This time around you take control of Yar — okay… so far, so good — which is the hacker handle for a young woman named Emi Kimura. A mysterious patron has hired Emi to hack her way into the shady corporation known as QoTech, and in true Metroidvania fashion she’ll do so through exploration that expands with every new technique she picks up along the way. It’s all presented in a clean, but somewhat stiff aesthetic that’s serviceable if a bit lacking in style and fluidity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">As Emi jogs through corridors, she’ll occasionally talk to herself. This can be cute at times, but it doesn’t necessarily bode well if she’s going to be doing it throughout the entire game. <em>Yars Rising </em>is also chock full of fully-voiced dialogue exchanges, so if you’re into that there’s plenty of it in this short jaunt. On the opposite end of the audio spectrum, the soundtrack slaps.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-yar-d-house" data-injectable="false"><strong>Yar’d house</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="791" data-injectable="true">The real <em>Yars’ Revenge </em>flavor comes into play during the hacking minigames. With flashing Atari-style visuals, hacking typically tasks you with breaking down a barrier so your Yar can fire its cannon. Some require shooting while others require nibbling, and they’re all fast and fun enough diversions. Successful hacks can unlock doors, reveal new Biohacks — equippable pickups that augment everything from crawl speed to Emi’s Zorlon Shot — and unlock abilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Stealth is also one of the game’s bullet points, and you’ll get to try one section out during the demo. It’s very straightforward, with Emi waiting for guards to turn their backs before slinking past, or crawling through an nearby air duct. Thus, the jury is out on whether or not the stealth portion of <em>Yars Rising </em>will be a thorn in the side of those who aren’t fond of sneaking missions.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-metroidvania-101" data-injectable="false"><strong>Metroidvania 101</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="821" data-injectable="true">I can’t be certain of what WayForward is going for here outside of spinning the license title roulette wheel, but <em>Yars Rising </em>seems like it could make for a solid introduction to the genre. As presented in this bite-sized sampler, everything from the structure to the combat is pure by-the-numbers Metroidvania action. There isn’t enough on display to give you a full taste of what exploration will be like, but you’ll secure two early abilities, one of which is essential to opening up new areas.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">It all closes with a battle against the Burning Sentinel, a rotund security robot that puts both of Emi’s current abilities to the test. Like the rest of the demo, it’s a clean and uncomplicated affair, but it’s enjoyable and manages to work the hacking minigame into the heat of combat in a novel way.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="false">At this point, we’re stretching the meaning of spiritual successor so thin it’s practically transparent, but there are enough nods to the source material in this demo to give it a pass. I may not be wild about what I’ve played of <em>Yars Rising</em>, but I’m curious. It has a deliberately stiff quality to it, and general movement isn’t quite as enjoyable as it should be given the genre, but I want to see more. Maybe it’s the WayForward name that has me looking past some of its flaws, but I’ve got more terminals to hack and I’m keen to see how the rest of this adventure plays out when it launches sometime this y(e)ar.&nbsp;</p>

There's also an Original mode, which is closer to the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>in style and tone.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer, we see peppy cheerleader Juliet Starling slaughtering zombies with her chainsaw, and we also get to meet Juliet's sisters Cordelia and Rosalind, as well as their father Gideon, all of whom will serve as support characters.</p>
<p>We're also introduced to the Dark Purveyors, the villains of the piece. They're five powerful, larger-than-life zombies with some pretty out-there theming, as you'll already know if you've played the original.</p>
<p>Here, in all its quirky glory, is the debut trailer for Dragami Games'&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>was announced back in 2022, and even as early as that, producer Yoshimi Yasuda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs">reassuring fans</a> that the game wouldn't deviate too much from the tone and style of the original.</p>
<p>The game was originally set to debut in 2023, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024">subsequently delayed to 2024</a>. Yasuda then revealed that the scope of the project had changed; rather than a fully-fledged remake, it would instead be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake">closer to a remaster</a>.</p>
<p>The recently-released trailer describes&nbsp;<em>RePOP&nbsp;</em>as a "remake", but it also says the story will be "unchanged", although quality-of-life improvements and "additional gameplay content" will be added.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll get to check out&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 25th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p><em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will seemingly adapt not only&nbsp;<em>Strive</em>, but also "the long-running&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>fighting video game series", per <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2240/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>website.</p>
<p>The two studios also shared the first artwork for&nbsp;<em>Dual Rulers</em>, which depicts series regulars Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske, as well as what appears to be a new character that we haven't seen before, although my&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>knowledge is pretty rusty so I might be wrong. Here's the artwork in all its glory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime-artwork.jpg?itok=ZNJE7g1r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime-artwork.jpg?itok=tJAWZml_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's your first look at&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The anime will be produced by Sanzigen Studios, whose name you'll know if you're a big&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>fan; it's the studio that produced the music video for protagonist Sol Badguy's theme "Find Your One Way".</p>
<p>The series' director will be Shigeru Morikawa, who's worked on productions like&nbsp;<em>Uta no Prince-sama</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Familiar of Zero</em>, among others.</p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>writer&nbsp;Norimitsu Kaihō, who also worked on the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa 3&nbsp;</em>anime adaptation, will be on "series composition" duty (presumably writing, not music), and&nbsp;<em>Fullmetal Alchemist&nbsp;</em>director Seiji Mizushima will serve as an associate producer on the project.</p>
<p>Just in case you need a refresher, here's a quick look at Sol Badguy's "Find Your One Way" music video to give you an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will probably look like.</p>

<p>Arc System Works says more details about&nbsp;<em>Dual Rulers&nbsp;</em>will be shared soon, and if you're lucky enough to be attending <a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anime Expo 2024</a>, you'll also get a behind-the-scenes look at the anime, as well as a first glimpse at a teaser trailer.</p>

<p>It’s finally here – Dragami Games has released the first official trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP, the highly anticipated remaster of the 2012 zombie-slashing title that James Gunn once worked on. In the inaugural trailer, we get a glimpse at the hack-and-slash-style gameplay that’s prevalent in Lollipop Chainsaw, and we’re reintroduced to Juliet, a protagonist who’ll give Stellar Blade’s Eve a run for her money in the clothing stakes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lollipop-chainsaw-repoping-onto-ps5">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOPing Onto PS5</h2>



<p>On September 25, Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will be released digitally on PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s not a full re<strong>make </strong>but a re<strong>master</strong>, with Dragami Games tidying up the title by boosting both the resolution and the frame rate to make it all run smoothly. Originally, Lollipop Chainsaw scored quite well when it was released in 2012, and there’s no reason to doubt that RePOP will perform any differently with reviewers. </p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - First Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCw7We5YqIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP is only being released digitally, and it has been promised that the game’s ‘visuals and soundtrack’ have been improved for this re-release. Dragami Games had to produce an original soundtrack for the game owing to the cost of licensing a curated playlist – but that’s the biggest difference between RePOP and the original 2012 game.</p>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 competition kicks off later tonight, on June 14, but a set of simulations on <em>EA FC 24</em> has already predicted the winners.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">The latest news has been shared on the game’s official X account, and I wasn’t expecting similar results. In 2022, EA Sports shared something similar in <em>FIFA 23</em> regarding who would go on to win the FIFA World Cup. Interestingly, the simulation was spot on as Argentina went on to lift the trophy in Qatar. Naturally, the latest prediction has created a buzz in the EA FC 24 community.</p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-simulation-predicts-england-as-euro-2024-winners" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 simulation predicts England as Euro 2024 winners</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">England is one of the stronger squads in Germany, and Southgate’s unit has a blend of youthful talents and seasoned veterans who can beat anyone on their given day. <em>EA FC 24</em> seems to believe that The Three Lions could finally win the coveted Euro 2024 tournament. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, EA Sports has yet to give the breakdown of the entire tournament (which was available in 2022). The developers have only announced the results of the final showdown, which puts England against hosts Germany. It appears that Harry Kane will have an important say as he scored the final goal in the simulation to help <strong>England win 2-1</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">In reality, both Germany and England could qualify for the finals and go on to lift the trophy. However, it will be challenging as some strong contenders might want to change this prediction. Nations like France, Italy, and Spain won’t be pushovers, and there are plenty of emerging contenders who could stake a claim for the trophy as well.</p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="false">While fans will need to wait till July 14 to know who wins in real life, they can create their own story in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode. EA Sports has introduced plenty of interesting content in Ultimate Team as well; the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-path-to-glory-upgrade-sbc-solutions/#:~:text=The%20EA%20FC%2024%20Path%20to%20Glory%20Upgrade%20SBC%20has,tasks%20have%20been%20completed%20successfully.&amp;text=It's%20best%20to%20use%20a,ratings%20much%20higher%20than%2084.">Path to Glory promo</a> is about to end, but Make Your Mark cards are coming soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/the-jackbox-megapicker-will-give-steam-players-one-launcher-to-rule-them-all/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox Games has announced The Jackbox Megapicker for Steam, giving PC players a single unified game launcher across all the Jackbox Party Packs when it launches in July 2024.</p>
<p>It’s one launcher to rule them all, one launcher to find them, one launcher to bring them all and in the party bind them!</p>


<p>The team said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over the past ten years, we have been lucky enough to have created a ton of games and become part of your life. We have helped entertain your friends and family when you wanted to break the ice, laugh, or for those nights when you just wanted to stop your weird uncle from talking. (We aren’t going to name names, but you know who we’re talking about.)</p>
<p>“However, with over 50 games, more and more you are saying that it takes a lot of effort to switch between packs to find all of the different games you want to play. In fact, here are some of the things we’ve heard directly from our players through social media, customer feedback surveys, and through hand-written pleas.”</p></blockquote>
<p>More specifics will be revealed prior to its launch, but The Jackbox Megapicker will let you view all of the minigames from any of the party packs that you own and launch into them much more quickly, taking the hassle out of remembering which pack had which games and jumping between them.</p>
<p>Really the only downside to the announcement is that The Jackbox Megapicker is only coming to Steam right now, so if you’ve diligently built up your collection on consoles, you’re out of luck.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only PC-first love that Jackbox has dished out, with the <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/TMP2-Party-Pack-6-Free-Update">Trivia Murder Party 2 free content update</a> in May also a Steam exclusive.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jackbox announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/29/jackbox-naughty-pack-promises-adults-only-filthy-fun-later-this-year/">The Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>, deliberately filthing up the party game antics with a smaller three-game pack. Of course, players have been able to get rather filthy of their own volition in the past, but now Jackbox themselves are getting into the action. After 10 years of trying to be more family friendly, it seems they’re letting their hair down a bit!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">our Jackbox 10 review,</a> “Jackbox Party Pack 10 is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

            <p>
With over 50 games spread over multiple individual packs, it can be a pain to play Jackbox Games with all the switching around.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, Jackbox Games has heard your pleas and is introducing The Jackbox Megapicker.
</p>
<p>
A free product exclusive to Steam, the Megapicker will allow players to view their complete game library, sort and filter them, and switch between multiple games without having to exit to Steam and load up a new pack each time.

<p>

So maybe you fancy a bit of Tee K.O, before jumping into Quiplash, a spot of Survive the Internet, and lastly - my personal favourite - Mad Verse City. Soon you'll be able to switch between them all seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
The Jackbox Megapicker is set for release at some point in July. More details will soon be revealed, including a forthcoming reddit AMA, according to a <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">blog post on the Megapicker</a>.

</p>
<p>
Back in April, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-is-getting-risque-with-adults-only-naughty-pack">risqué adults-only Naughty Pack</a> is in development (as if Jackbox wasn't already risqué).

</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for that, nor news on what the games will be, but it's due out this year. Presumably the Megapicker will allow these to be filtered in and out, depending on how family friendly you wish to be.

<p>FromSoftware Boss Hidetaka Miyazaki finally addressed the highly requested PC port for Bloodborne during an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>. Miyazaki clarified before expressing that it was not his place “to talk about Bloodborne specifically” as FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP for the title; it rests in the hands of Sony Interactive Entertainment, the game’s publisher. Any decision regarding a PC port would ultimately be up to Sony. However, Miyazaki adds that he is 100% sure that the team at FromSoftware desires a PC port.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Bloodborne - Cut You Down Trailer | The Hunt Begins | PS4" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Miyazaki expanded that as “one of the creators of Bloodborne”, he naturally wants “more players to be able to enjoy it”. Miyazaki further spoke about how Bloodborne is a “coming of age game” now, and these types of titles from the past have a chance of being forgotten due to older hardware”. He adds that he is “not opposed to” the Bloodborne PC port as it will be an “opportunity for players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past.” Miyazaki being open to a Bloodborne PC port is indeed thrilling, but the truth is that we still need to find out whether we will receive a PC port for the title from Sony’s mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, gaming news source <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1801409807406284978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> has provided a different perspective. According to Grubb, a Bloodborne PC port with FromSoftware involved is “just not happening at the moment”. He suggests that FromSoftware’s time is too valuable, and Sony may not be willing to ‘pay the premium’ to secure the port. Grubb concludes that we’ll unlikely see the developers working on a ‘one-console exclusive’ again.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's just not happening at the moment. At least not involving From. From's time is worth too much, and Sony probably doesn't want to pay the premium to lock it down. It's hard to imagine From working on a one-console exclusive ever again. <a href="https://t.co/w04P433oTg">https://t.co/w04P433oTg</a></p>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1801409807406284978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Will we ever receive a PC port for Bloodborne? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>I’ve enjoyed a Welsh break with my family, and while there’s been lots of swimming, paddleboarding and building sandcastles, I’ve got my trusty Switch for a dose of gaming in the quieter moments, though, and so I’ve embarked on Warframe – not least because I’m intrigued by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/digital-extremes-drop-more-tennocon-2024-details-for-warframe-fans/">Warframe 1999</a> – and the Switch version holds up really well. It does have me asking the question why we’ve never been able to get a Switch version of Destiny 2, but that’s a question for another day. Besides that, I’ve been playing Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble for a future review.</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2. And he finished up his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape</a> review where you can find out what he thinks about it. Does he like the shape it is? Is it the last one or is this more ‘Final Fantasy’ than it is the end of everything? Find out now!</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> would like to have been playing something, but he isn’t playing something, and this has irked him. So much so that I’ve had to work out that he’s played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/demons-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works/">Demon’s Mirror</a> because he didn’t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> did much better with his gaming, despite having a newborn, and he’s been played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance-review/">Shin Megami Tensai 5 Vengeance</a> for review. I’d take a click and see what he thought of it – will it be enough to get me to rebuy and replay the game?</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has finished his playthrough of SteamWorld Dig, saying, “It was fun!” as well as dipping back into Assassin’s Creed Mirage. He tells us, “I’m still enjoying and wandering around ancient Baghdad, stealing treasure and getting into scraps.”</p>
<p><strong>Nick P</strong> doesn’t entirely understand why he’s spent the week in the WWE 2K24 MyGM mode, while sneaking in a little bit of DBD and Street Fighter 6. If it helps, Nick, I don’t understand either.</p>
<p>More explicable is <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> playing of Rogue Trader,&nbsp;saying, “Inspite of its crashes and slightly frustrating movement it continues to be absolutely phenomenally good, provided you love CRPGs. I imagine it’s quite hard to get on with otherwise.” That’s not been all though, as he’s also played some Dredge, which he loved, as well as some local multiplayer in Rocket League.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/tails-of-iron-2-whiskers-of-winter-preview/">Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter</a> for preview, which he did like, and then he gave V-Rising a go which he didn’t really like, “It left me cold – like an undead blood-sucker – so I played more X-Defiant instead.” He continued, “While I was playing that though, I suddenly realised that other than the Splinter Cell lot, I had no frame of reference for the other factions, having never played their games. So, I decided to correct that by playing Far Cry 6, which I am enjoying!”</p>
<p>And to round out his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/best-places-to-visit-final-fantasy-xiv/">prep for Dawntrail</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Reuben</strong> finally caught up on the Main Scenario Quests for Final Fantasy XIV. He says, “I really enjoyed the last dungeon and trial of Endwalker, and I’m now putting all my time into levelling Paladin despite not liking tanking.”</p>

<p>Finishing things off for this week is <strong>Tef</strong>, who played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preview-revisiting-one-of-the-best-3ds-games/">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for a preview, dabbled with a touch of Cat Quest 3, and something else that he can’t tell you all about just yet. He’s also been watching things before he lets his subscriptions expire, trying to finish off the most recent season of For All Mankind, and racing through the excellent X-Men ’97.</p>
<p>That’s it from us, what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/14/thq-nordic-has-two-secret-games-theyre-taking-to-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has partially announced the line up of games that they’re taking to Gamescom 2024 in August, with three previously revealed projects and two mysterious unannounced games that they’re teasing us with.</p>
<p>Thos two secret games will be announced during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2024 on 2nd August, but will then all will be playable at Gamescom, which runs from 21st to 25th August. They’ll be found in Hall 7.1.</p>


<p>The five games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</li>
<li>Gothic Remake</li>
<li>Titan Quest II</li>
<li>_ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #1” – one word / six letters)</li>
<li>_ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ (space) _ _ (space) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (“Unannounced Game #2” – five words / 23 letters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any guesses? For Unannounced Game #2, I’ve had a look back through THQ Nordic’s back catalogue and The Valiant and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/05/the-dwarves-review/">The Dwarves</a> would both fit the letter counts. Unless it’s a brand new property, I’d put money on The Dwarves: Something of Something.</p>

<p>For the rest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/epic-mickey-rebrushed-ps5-xbox-switch/">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>&nbsp;is a remaster of the 2010 Wii game, directed by the legendary Warren Spector, producer of Wing Commander, Deus Ex, and System Shock. The game follows Mickey as he breaks in to a world of “forgotten things”, concept art and animations for cartoons that never made it to the screen. The levels are loosely a based on locations at the Disneyland theme park, and Mickey will be tormented by Shadow Blot, a creature he created but based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey his original comic strips.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrPQ6L1nXlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gothic Remake is far more ambitious. This remake of the cult classic fantasy action RPG&nbsp;was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since. We’ve had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/gothic-remake-old-camp-trailer-in-engine/">occasional check-ins</a> with the game since then, but a first playable public demo is an exciting milestone.</p>
<p>And rounding things out is Titan Quest 2. This was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">announced during THQ Nordic’s showcase last August</a>, and promises a more tactical approach to the top-down action RPG style. Also giant crabs.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has spoken on the discourse surrounding Assassin's Creed Shadows' co-lead character Yasuke, an African samurai.</p>
<p>When Ubisoft unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows in May, there was backlash directed at the inclusion of this historical character, with many overly-vocal individuals on the internet affronted by the game's supposed 'wokeness'.</p>
<p>This discussion was amplified when controversial owner of social media platform X Elon Musk joined in. Replying to one user suggesting Ubisoft should delay its release of Shadows "in response to widespread backlash over the game's injection of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion]", Musk quipped: "DEI kills art."</p>

<p>Of course, this exchange was not missed by the Assassin's Creed team. However, Côté chose not to rise to Musk's post, and instead ignored it.</p>
<p>"That tweet generated emotions, that...the first thing I wanted to do was go back on X - that I had deleted - and just tweet back," Côté told Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a>. "And I just took a step back. I have a mindfulness app on my phone. And I did a bit of mindfulness to try to explore the emotions that this tweet created.</p>
<p>"For me, Elon, it's sad, he's just feeding hatred. I had a lot of three word replies that came to mind."</p>
<p>Côté said he knew that replying to Musk at that moment would not help Ubisoft's case. "By attacking someone like Elon... I will not convince people about our point of view as a team," he said, before adding: "Yasuke is very, very grounded in the history of the franchise and how we make our choices."</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed developer added when the Shadows' team did their initial research, "Yasuke kept surfacing", and soon things clicked into place. "We've got a super-mysterious historical character from which not much is known about. And for us, it was what we want in [Assassin's Creed]," he explained.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"What Elon says is not the game that we're building," Côté continued. "People will have to play the game for themselves. And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we're doing, we can have the discussion."</p>
<p>The developer did not state why this particular moment in the game will be so crucial, simply adding: "I was reviewing the game very recently, and I was like, 'The answer is there!' I just hope and wish that people can keep an open mind about this and see the game for what it is.</p>
<p>"It's an Assassin's Creed game, and I believe the best one we've ever built."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to talking about Yasuke, Côté also revealed Assassin's Creed Infinity - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">series' upcoming video game-adjacent experience</a> described by Ubisoft as an interactive hub - has got itself a new name.</p>
<p>Côté said the next series entry Shadows will launch from the Animus, revealing the hub's new name in the process - the rather apt 'Animus hub'. This hub is where the series' modern day segments will now be accessed from going forward. The studio exec promised we would get more details on this "later", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-extended-gameplay-reveal-shows-off-its-stealthy-and-not-so-stealthy-styles">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November 2024.</p>

            <p>Back in February, Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">wrote about</a> potential redundancies at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M">People Make Games documentary</a>. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To get you up to speed in as few links as possible. Disco Elysium released on October 15th 2019.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-review"> Alice Bee liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-offers-a-dark-mirror-to-my-mid-life-crisis">Alec liked it</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysiums-hardcore-mode-is-just-one-way-games-can-meaningfully-explore-poverty">I liked it</a>. Everyone liked it. Nothing bad ever happened again. Then, inexplicably, bad things did start happening. Setting creator and lead ideasman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-dev-files-lawsuit-against-the-studio-that-allegedly-kicked-him-out">Robert Kurvitz got booted from the studio</a>, other leads followed him, insults were thrown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-disco-elysium-devs-allege-fraud-at-studio-zaum-say-civil-and-criminal-charges-are-on-the-table">fraud was alleged</a>,  things <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender">got resolved but also not really.</a> It was such an incredibly messy situation you could make, well, a two-and-a-half hour PMG video out of it.</p>
<p>Some key creative talent from Disco Elysium did remain at the studio however - such as writer and narrative designer Justin Keenan - and more projects were in the works. A full sequel to Disco Elysium was canceled after Kurvitz, Rostov, and Hindpere left the studio, and an unrelated sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>was put on pause in 2023, but has since been cancelled. X7, a standalone expansion to the original DE, was canceled in February. “Nearly a quarter of the studio's staff” were also laid off at this time, including the X7 lead writer Argo Tuulik.</p>
<p>"I felt that a strong resentment developed towards Argo for growing too big for his shoes, so to speak," fellow X7 lead writer Dora Klindžić told PC Gamer. “I got the sense that there was resentment for the fact Argo was getting so much support from fans, while [ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus], Tõnis, and the company weren't.”</p>
<p>"They put Argo through a humiliation campaign,” Klindžić continues. “They made him apologize to people for what he said in the [People Make Games] interview. They undermined his confidence and tried to make him doubt himself. They told him he was incompetent, unqualified, and unfit to lead his own project, demoted him and made him invisible inside the studio."</p>
<p>Klindžić had left their job as an academic physicist and space mission scientist in 2022 to work on the sequel to Disco Elysium. “I felt I had just abandoned my entire life and career only to end up in a studio where the people I had come to work with were fired, and the project I was meant to work on shelved with no reason given."</p>
<p>The X7 project itself could have been released around 2025, although timelines differ with the staff Litchfield spoke to. Again, the original article is well worth your time. I won't bother pointing out the eyeball-scooping irony that the most radical and inspiring mainstream game in recent memory has continued to be surrounded by so much baffling greed and spite, although I suppose I just did. </p>

			<p>As rumored ahead of the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> its big June event with Gears of War: E-Day, the next game from The Coalition.</p>
<p>The debut trailer looked fantastic, but since it aired on the show fans have debated whether it was rendered in real time or not. A spokesperson from The Coalition has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-was-done-entirely-in-engine/1100-6524152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to Gamespot that the footage was indeed not in real time.</p>
<p><em>The Gears of War: E-Day trailer was made in collaboration across The Coalition, Blur Studios and GNet developed using in-game models, textures and environments--all captured in Unreal Engine 5. It was not captured in real time as some have suggested.</em></p>
<p>Having said that, The Coalition (the first AAA studio to transition to Unreal Engine 5) clarified it has big ambitions for the game's visuals, including ray tracing support for lighting, reflections, and shadows. Studio Technical Director Kate Rayner <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to Xbox Wire:</p>
<p><em>With the advancements in Unreal Engine 5, the leap in technical capabilities is tremendous. Our ambition is to, once again, set a new standard in technical excellence. We have fully modernized Gears from the ground up, infusing the DNA of Gears with the full capabilities of modern gaming technology. Every character, environment, and animation in Gears of War: E-Day has been completely rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, allowing us to portray the Gears universe with unprecedented detail and fidelity. The original ‘Mad World’ trailer made a real statement by using in-engine footage. We’re pushing that even further with Unreal Engine 5. Our goal with the announcement trailer was to highlight our commitment to pushing the boundaries of both storytelling and technology in gaming.</em></p>
<p>The Coalition is confident in the prequel not just because of the visuals, either, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-story-will-show-the-coalitions-tech-the-best-creative-director-says-will-be-the-best-f-gears-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promising</a> it will be the best game in the franchise yet. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, it might launch next year on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

        <p>Remake of the 2004 GameCube title sold over 115,000 units in three days</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door topped the Japan charts in May, moving 115,649 units in the three days after its launch on May 23.</p>
<p>It nearly matched the success of the original GameCube title released in 2004, which shifted 138,000 copies at launch, according to the latest data from Famitsu. That said, the remake is also available digitally via the Nintendo eShop, and those sales are not accounted for here.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was the second-best selling title last month with 46,424 copies sold, followed by new entry Endless Ocean Luminous at 42,847 which launched on May 2.</p>
<p>The charts were dominated by Nintendo in May, with Stellar Blade being the only title not released on Switch. Games such as Ring Fit Adventure and Animal Crossing: New Horizons also returned to the Top 10, sitting alongside other Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Bros Wonder and Princess Peach: Showtime.</p>
<p>Nintendo was also the biggest selling publisher accounting for 48.5% of sales, having generated ¥2.6 billion ($16.5 million) in revenue. This was driven by the success of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Endless Ocean Luminous.</p>
<p>Switch remained the best selling format accounting for 79.9% of sales with 769,886 boxed games sold, followed by PS5 at 144,005 accounting for 15%.</p>
<p>As for hardware, Switch remained at the top with its three models selling a combined 192,824 units. Switch sold an additional 193,000 units in May, bringing its lifetime sales to 32.9 million units. Both models of the PS5 sold 89,207 units, once again led by the disc drive version.</p>
<p>Here are the top ten best-selling boxed games for May 2024:</p>

<p data-characters="412" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Despite it being over nine years since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a></em> launched on PlayStation 4, fans have not given up on demanding that Sony port the game to PC. If not Sony, then developer FromSoftware and the game’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki. In fact, Miyazaki was recently pressed on his own feelings on a PC port and while he’s not opposed to the idea, he stopped short of saying if he himself wants it to happen.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> recently got to interview Miyazaki about the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a>, and so it took the opportunity to quiz Miyazaki once more on <em>Bloodborne</em> for PC. In past interviews, Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hidetaka-miyazaki-responds-to-bloodborne-remake-requests-during-elden-ring-dlc-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrained from discussing <em>Bloodborne</em> specifically</a> since FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP. But when asked if he personally wants <em>Bloodborne</em> on PC, Miyazaki admitted that other members of FromSoftware are certainly keen on it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">“I know for a fact these guys want a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port,” answered Miyazaki, referring to producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. As for his own feelings, Miyazaki remained cagey, explaining he would “get in trouble as well” if he said he wanted it to happen. If Sony were to ever greenlight the port, though, Miyazaki would at least be up for it, saying, “It’s nothing I’m opposed to.” He added he’d love for more people to be able to play and enjoy <em>Bloodborne</em>, especially with it becoming “one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware.”</p>
 <p data-characters="623" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">It really seems like the only thing preventing a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port from happening is Sony itself, yet it’s a topic the company has otherwise refused to chime in on. Sony is most certainly aware of the demand for it, though that might be why it doesn’t like talking about it. Any acknowledgment of <em>Bloodborne</em> just invites non-stop comments about a PC port or gets people thinking an announcement is on the way. In 2022, Sony’s official Twitter account <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-tweets-about-bloodborne-then-promptly-deletes-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made a post featuring the <em>Bloodborne</em> box art and subsequently deleted it</a>, possibly because it sparked assumptions that it was teasing a port or remaster.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">More recently, it was revealed pre-orders for the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/astro-bot-gets-a-brand-new-mission-in-a-self-titled-adventure-this-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a></em> platformer will include a <em>Bloodborne</em> costume, and a new <em>Bloodborne</em> cameo was added to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a></em>. Unsurprisingly, developer Team Asobi confirmed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that there’s “no secret meaning” behind these; they’re just part of the wider PlayStation celebrations.</p> <p data-characters="714" data-current-count="1082" data-injectable="false">Personally, it is bizarre that Sony hasn’t ported <em>Bloodborne</em> to PC yet, especially considering it’s been embracing the platform in recent years, with several PlayStation exclusives making the jump. Unfortunately for Sony, it can’t say it won’t ever port <em>Bloodborne</em> because then it’ll just be met with angry comments from fans who will keep demanding it anyway. So, there’s really no winning for Sony unless it ever announces a PC release. In the meantime, the only bit of new <em>Bloodborne</em> content fans can enjoy is the fan-made <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nightmare-kart-the-legally-distinct-gothic-horror-kart-racer-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightmare Kart</a></em>, which was meant to be an unofficial <em>Bloodborne</em> kart racer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until Sony stepped in</a>, forcing the developer to make it more legally distinct.</p>

            <p>
After the reveal of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot on PlayStation 5</a> at the recent State of Play, Astro's Playroom received an update adding iconic Bloodborne boss Lady Maria and an associated trophy. That's on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-bloodborne-on-ps5-but-its-astro-bot-in-disguise">Bloodborne costumes as a pre-order bonus</a> for the new game.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this led to speculation from Bloodborne fans that something was afoot. Alas, it appears that's not the case.
</p>
<p>
"There's no secret meaning," Team Asobi studio head and creative director Nicolas Doucet told Eurogamer. "It's just a celebration of the whole PlayStation history."
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Astro Bot - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>

Doucet discussed further how in Astro Bot the team will focus on cameos from PlayStation characters, instead of the hardware references in Astro's Playroom.
</p>
<p>
"Instead of the hardware we put our attention towards the characters," he said. "And that's why we push these cameos. Before they were quite primitive, but now they feel much richer looking. It's over 150 [cameos], so it's going to go really deep and everybody should have their favourite ones."
</p>
<p>
The Astro's Playroom update, then, appears to be simply hinting at what we can expect to see in Astro Bot.
</p>
<p>
Still, Bloodborne fans are desperate for a re-release of FromSoftware's game, particularly on PC. And, it turns out, creator Hidetaka Miyazaki isn't opposed to the idea either.
</p>
<p>
"I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a>, referring to FromSoftware producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. "If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "Obviously, as one of the creators of Bloodborne, my personal, pure honest opinion is I'd love more players to be able to enjoy it. Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware - I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past. So as far as I'm concerned, that's definitely not something I'd be opposed to."
</p>
<p>
This mirrors a previous comment from Miyazaki to Eurogamer, concerning the benefits of newer hardware to give remakes value - especially with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">possible Bloodborne remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>It seems the ball is in Sony's court, then, as it owns the rights to Bloodborne - not FromSoftware. That's why a cameo in an Astro Bot game is possible, even if a PC port isn't on the cards.
</p>
<p>
If you want to find Lady Maria for yourself in Astro's Playroom, she can be found in the GPU Jungle. Any excuse to listen to that banger of a song, right?

            <p>The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts</a> has come to Steam. The games have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/discover/kingdom-hearts">been on Epic Games Store</a> since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term "open up" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The games are being packaged together in a bundle as "Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece" that will set you back £85, for anyone who wants to take a wild run at the series at full speed. But you can also buy them singly, with the slow and reasonable patience of a true Donald Duck appreciater. Here's the list of games that have come to the store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts Xero Pre-maxio VII.7: The Bebludgeoning 2.Z</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I made that last one up. You got me. I just get carried away sometimes, you know how it is. Video games as an art form have long been bastardised by bizarre naming conventions driven by neurotic marketing, but this series really takes the biscuit in terms of opaque numbering, no? Anyway, none of that helps explain what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> games are about, which is loosely this: Disney characters meet Square Enix characters and go on a loopy, touching adventure. The next entry in the series is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">teasing the introduction of Star Wars characters</a> too. As a genre, we may call this "mashocore". </p>
<p>Each of the items listed above aren't technically games in themselves but packages of multiple titles. There are about ten games in total, if you buy the whole lot. But to understand exactly what you're getting in each package, it's best to check <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's own post breaking down what's included</a>. Don't worry, they won't make stuff up like I do. At least, I hope not.</p>

        <p>World of Warcraft general manager "excited to explore new opportunities" following departure</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>John Hight has left Blizzard Entertainment after being with the company for over a decade.</p>
<p>Hight, who joined Blizzard in 2011, announced the news on <a href="https://x.com/JHight_Gamer/status/1801330355204722933">social media</a> in which he shared he is "excited to explore new opportunities."</p>
<p>"After 12 incredible years at Blizzard, I've decided to step away and start a new quest," Hight wrote. "It was a tough decision, but I feel like now is as good a time as any: Warcraft is in an amazing position as the universe turns 30. I've been so honoured to serve all of the heroes of Azeroth."</p>
<p>He continued: "As for what's next in my journey, I don't have any specifics to share quite yet, but I am excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in the industry, and continue making great games with talented people."</p>
<p>Hight joined Blizzard as senior producer on World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria. He became executive producer and vice president of the franchise during his tenure, before becoming general manager in November 2021.</p>
<p>He also directed production on Diablo 3 and its Reaper of Souls expansion.</p>
<p>Hight started his career in 1993 as creative director of internal development startup The 3DO Company. He joined Electronic Arts in 1996 as executive producer and director of design before moving to Atari in 2002 in another executive producer role.</p>
<p>In 2005, Hight joined Sony as director of product development, working on God of War 3 and the launch of the PlayStation Network.</p>

UK national treasures Inkle - they who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">looped the globe in 80 days</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">vaulted the heavens</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">sang of the highlands</a> - are making a brand new investigation-ma-jig called Miss Mulligatawney's School For Promising Girls, though the presskit notes that this might not be the final title. It's set in a 1920s boarding school, where you can expect "tuition in Latin, Geometry and a wide range of team sports, all within the beautiful setting of our isolated country estate". Also some murders, possibly.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's no trailer yet and there are no screens of the game, but an accompanying brochure hints at a kind of Enid Blyton reworking of Persona, in which you carry out chores by day under the eye of senior prefects, and seek after strange events at night, at peril of being caught by the Matron and her tyrannous owl (disclaimer: owl possibly heraldic in nature). There's mention of a Scriptorium, too, which reminds me of Umberto Eco's The Name Of The Rose - also a tale of investigation after dark. I hope there's a labyrinth. Perhaps the owl can live there.
</p>
<p>
Who are you? Well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Miss_Mulligatawneys_School_for_Promising_Girls/">the Steam page</a> notes that "one scholarship place is available to a promising candidate from a lower-class background", which suggests you might spend a fair portion of the dialogue dealing with toffee-nosed snobs, toffee being the preferred means of cleansing aristocratic nostrils back in the roaring twenties. The school building itself used to be a 17th century nunnery, which was "dissolved in disrepute", perhaps because one of the nuns had a child. Her statue yet stands in the school quad, "as a reminder to the girls of all they can achieve". The brochure also describes a "miraculous" rose window in the school's main tower - I'm guessing it's the one in that final slide, there, with somebody falling out of it.

Ugh, this would have been one for Alice B, who has written whole bloody mystery books reminiscent of this, and who deemed Inkle's most recent game, A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-highland-song-review">"a beautiful snapshot of wild places that stumbles a little" but is nonetheless "trip worth taking"</a>. What's Alice B up to these days? We can only speculate.

			<p>FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki is not opposed to the release of a Bloodborne PC port, but it seems like the ball is in Sony's court for it to happen, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">PC Gamer</a> about the PlayStation 4 exclusive action role-playing game developed in conjunction with the now-defunct Sony Japan Studio, Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that other people at FromSoftware, such as producer Yasuhiro Kitao, would want a PC port. He added that he would get in trouble if he said he wanted it as well, but he is not opposed to it. Elaborating further, he added that, being one of the Bloodborne creators, he would love more players to be able to enjoy it, especially as a game that is now "coming of age" and is stuck on older hardware.</p>
<p>Judging from these statements, it's clear how the release of a Bloodborne PC port almost entirely depends on Sony. In the past few years, we have heard multiple times that either a port, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">remaster, and even a sequel</a> are in the works, and even that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-remaster-can-be-done-at-any-time-without-from-softwares-support-japan-studio-had-a-working-pc-build/"> Japan Studio had a working PC build</a> at some point, but nothing has been officially announced so far, and the silence on the matter seems to suggest that there is no interest for a port so far. As such, the only way to experience one of the best action role-playing games released by FromSoftware is to play the original PlayStation 4 version, which was enhanced to run at 60 frames per second a while back with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-released/">unofficial patch.</a></p>

            <p>The orcs and goblins of the Greenskins, the sizeable gourmands of the Ogre Kingdoms, and the angry Christmas ornaments of Khorne are the next three factions to get new units, lords, and campaigns as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>’s next DLC. The news comes via official  posts by developer Creative Assembly on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1df0wyz/karanak_with_update_51_at_the_end_of_this_month/#lightbox">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/totalwar/status/1801253295664590915">X</a>.</p>

<p>They’ll be more info on the 26th of June, when senior game director Rich Alridge will be dishing the toenail fungus on the fresh batch of toys. The Reddit post (which is where all the detail is, if your doctor told you to only click one link a day or summin) also says that Kharnak, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-is-getting-a-sequel-and-total-war-warhammer-3-is-getting-a-big-red-dog">the free canine legendary hero for Khorne</a>, will be available at the end of the month. This irritates my soul, because I’m not going to play a Khorne campaign when I know new Khorne goodies are right around the corner, but there you go. And <em>that’s</em> how you find a way to complain about freebies!</p>
<p>As regular readers might know, I’ve been known to dabble in a little Twarhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conquering-total-war-warhammer-3-as-a-pirate-with-a-pathological-aversion-to-ever-touching-grass">here and there</a>. The broccoli-like fact portion of this news dinner is over, and now is the time for some greasy speculation. Welcome 2 greasetown, pals.</p>
<p>For the Ogre Kingdoms, no real contest here. Dataminers recently discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjqy67/golgfag_animations_found_in_wh3_files/">animations</a>, which they linked to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1cjeftl/found_a_new_ogre_model_in_the_game_files_it_is/">model</a>, labeled ‘Golfag’. That’ll be <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Golgfag_Maneater">Golfag Maneater</a>, then. A legendary ogre mercenary, so renowned that all other ogre mercenaries took the name ‘Maneaters’ in tribute. Maneaters themselves are some of the most fun and diverse ogres out there, each adorned in the raiments of their individual conquests and adventures. As for units, both <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Yhetee">Yhetees </a>and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusks</a> seem like reasonably safe bets.</p>
<p>As for Khorne and the Greenskins, I’m less certain, although the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">colossal squig</a> is already floating around on Reddit as a ‘want plz’. And yes, I also want, plz. Squig but big?! What more do you need honestly. As it happens, the promise of more Greenskins were the biggest pleasant surprise for me from this announcement. The Warden And The Paunch is a well-loved bit of content, and a personal favourite. You can cook a horrible pizza that gives you melee defence for some reason! While I’m not sure if any of the potential remaining orc lords have quite the same panache as Grom, more green is certainly no bad thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-panache-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox is said to have secured a deal with Panache Digital, the studio from the mastermind behind Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.</p>
<p>That's what reputable leaker 'eXtas1s' <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/xbox-signs-agreement-with-panache-assassins-creeds-creators-studio-for-new-project.124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> on the eXputer forums. According to the leaker, outlet eXputer has seen "graphical evidence" that Xbox has signed an agreement with Montreal-based Panache Digital Games and its founder Patrice Désilets for a new project. Additional details about this project haven't been shared, but 'eXtas1s' does mention that the project will run in Unreal Engine 5, and going by an insider source from the leaker, the project is targeting a 2026 or 2027 release. Of course, release windows are, more than ever, subject to change.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Panache Digital Games released Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey in 2019. Be sure to read<a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-with-patrice-desilets-on-ancestors-playing-badass-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> our 2019 interview </a>with Désilets about the third-person survival game. In 2019, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/patrice-desilets-interview-ancestors-1666-amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an interview</a> with the talented designer about his plans for '1666 Amsterdam'. Whether the new Xbox project is related to this project from Désilets is unknown at this point. We've included a part of that interview below:</p>
<p><em><strong>During your talk you briefly mentioned still wanting to make 1666 Amsterdam. To clarify, is that something you’re actively moving forward on now?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I dunno...I've been talking about [1666 Amsterdam] since I got the rights back to it. Yeah, I want to make that game. The chances that it's my next one are really, really high. In my head, I started it. I went back to what I designed in 2011 and 2012 and said, what do I want to do? Now it's the game after Ancestors and not Assassin's Creed II. I'm a different person and designer and have a new team, so it's going to change.</em></p>
<p><em>Ancestors is going to be how Panache does games in the future. That's our signature. So...1666 will not be an easy game. Eventually I'll announce it for real. The elevator pitch is really simple -- do you want to play the devil in 1666 Amsterdam by the guy who did Assassin's Creed and Ancestors?</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this rumored Xbox deal with Panache.</p>

        <p>Private equity firm within group that is considering cash offer for services empire has until June 28 to formally announce</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The potential acquisition of Keywords Studios has been delayed as the company is granted an extension to the period in which its prospective buyer must make its offer.</p>
<p>As reported last month, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/private-equity-firm-in-talks-to-buy-keywords-studios">private equity firm within the EQT Group is considering a cash offer</a> at £25.50 per share to acquire the games development services firm. In a regulatory notice, Keywords confirmed it has been in advanced discussions with its potential buyer.</p>
<p>EQT was required to make a formal offer, or announce that it would not make an offer, by 5pm on June 15. Keywords has requested an extension to this deadline, and this has been approved by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers.</p>
<p>The private equity firm now has until 5pm on June 28 to state its intentions regarding the acquisition of Keywords Studios. This deadline may be extended further if requested by Keywords, providing the Takeover Panel consents.</p>
<p>Originally a localisation provider, the 26-year-old Keywords Studios has expanded its services over the years via more than 60 acquisitions since January 2014, now offering art, audio, game development, PR, marketing, and more.</p>

<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Between the likes of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/castlevania-nocturne-gets-renewed-for-a-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castlevania</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-take-a-closer-look-at-arcane-season-2s-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcane</a></em>, and upcoming projects like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/among-us-animated-series-gets-a-monstrous-trailer-with-star-studded-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Among Us</em> cartoon</a>, we really are living in a golden age of animated TV shows based on video games. And now we can add fighting game <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-guilty-gear-strive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> </a>to the list as developer Arc System Works has announced its own anime series titled <em>Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers</em>.</p> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Details are incredibly slim, with <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggstdr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the teaser website</a> only showing new artwork of series protagonist Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske, while a mysterious new character looms over them in the background. What we do know is that <em>Guilty Gear</em> creator and character designer Daisuke Ishiwatari is involved, and the show is being made at Sanzigen, a studio that specialises in 3D animation. Sanzigen was also responsible for <a href="https://youtu.be/gp4-n_u-qM0?si=JAZq5k6Z1CeVwafg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this incredible looking one-year anniversary short</a> for <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>, so <em>Dual Rulers</em> is certainly in safe hands. <em>Strive</em>‘s animation remains one of its best qualities and the thought of an entire TV show with the same level of visual fidelity is very exciting.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="【Official】 GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- &quot;Find Your One Way&quot; MV 【1st Anniversary】" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gp4-n_u-qM0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">Fortunately, we won’t have to wait much longer to learn more. Arc System Works will have a panel at this year’s Anime Expo, and has promised to share further details about <em>Dual Rulers</em> on July 4. Ideally, this will include a trailer or at least a plot synopsis. Since<em> Guilty Gear Strive</em>‘s story mode is literally over four hours of non-stop cutscenes, it’s probably safe to assume <em>Dual Rulers</em> isn’t an adaptation and will instead tell an original story.</p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">I’m honestly a bit surprised <em>Guilty Gear</em> has never seen an anime adaptation or even an OVA in its 26-year history. There have been spin-off manga, novels, audio dramas, and comics, so a full anime series was frankly overdue. I’m also curious if <em>Dual Rulers </em>will make a good jumping on point for newcomers who are unfamiliar with <em>Guilty Gear</em>‘s lore or if it’ll be something that only established fans will be able to understand and enjoy.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case, <em>Guilty Gear</em> fans have plenty to look forward to in the near future besides the anime. <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> recently wrapped up its third season pass of DLC with the inclusion of Slayer, but a season four is already confirmed to be in the works too. So, fans should expect a few more playable characters either later this year or in 2025.</p>

			<p>The eagle-eyed folks at Reddit's GameLeaksAndRumours channel have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dfftlq/unannounced_games_found_in_actors_resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> potential release windows for several games, including Clockwork Revolution, Ace Combat 8, and Squadron 42, on an actor's resume.</p>
<p>This is a very busy actor in the gaming space in the last few years, having appeared in some capacity in games like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Enlisted, Crossfire X, Chernobylite, The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me, Sea of Thieves, Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, War Thunder, Warhaven, Undecember, Ready or Not, PAYDAY 3, Front Mission 1st: Remake, Fallout 76: Atlantic City, Diablo Immortal, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, Atomic Heart, Alien: Dark Descent, and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. He's also working on upcoming titles like Unicorn Overlord, The Division: Resurgence, World of Warcraft: The War Within, Age of Mythology Retold, The House of the Dead 2 remake, and some sort of expansion for Hearthstone.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, though, the most interesting mentions are for next year's games, starting with inXile's first-person steampunk roleplaying game Clockwork Revolution. The actor plays a 'Smudger /Zealot' in the game, which is listed for a 2025 release. Neither inXile nor Microsoft have ever committed to a release window yet; while the game was notably absent from last week's Xbox Games Showcase, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> at last year's event with actual gameplay rather than a mere trailer. Moreover, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> Microsoft might have been holding back some games for gamescom. If that's the case, we could be only a couple of months away from an official confirmation that Clockwork Revolution is coming out next year.</p>
<p>The actor's 2025 list also includes Ace Combat 8 from Bandai Namco, where he'll play a 'Cope /Cargo Pilot'. The Japanese publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-7-3-million-copies-sequel-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in 2021 that they were working on a new installment in the long-running flight action series, though we don't have any other details at the moment.</p>
<p>Another major surprise is 'Star Citizen', where he plays a character named 'Jimmy', listed for a 2025 date. Chances are the actor is referring to Squadron 42 instead, as the single player campaign mode is much more likely to get a full launch next year than the persistent universe mode. As you might remember, Squadron 42 has been feature-complete and in polishing mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since</a> last October. Then there's a project codenamed Oahu in development at Gearbox. It is unclear whether this is Borderlands 4, though.</p>
<p>The 2025 list is rounded up by Fable 4 from Playground Games, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020 from Supermassive Games, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion from Marvelous, 63 Days - Warsaw Uprising from Destructive Creations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/narrative-driven-action-adventure-game-echoes-of-the-end-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echoes of the End</a> from Myrkur Games, a project codenamed Mayhem from Anshar Studios (Gamedec), and Infinitesimals from Cubit Studios.</p>
<p>Which of these 2025 games (assuming the release windows are eventually confirmed) are you most looking forward to? My vote might go to Clockwork Revolution.</p>

			<p>At the beginning of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance/">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a>'s Canon of Vengeance is not particularly different from the regular Canon of Creation story introduced in the game's original release. Soon enough, however, you will get to meet some powerful enemies that cannot be found in the other Canon, powerful enemies that can give you a lot of trouble if unprepared.</p>
<p>Among them are Glasya-Labolas and Naamah of the Qadištu, the mysterious group of demons at the center of the Canon of Vengeance story. Thankfully, taking them down is not too difficult if you have certain demons with the right skills for you.</p>
<h2>How to Beat Glasya-Labolas and Naamah in Shin Megami Tensei V's Canon of Vengeance</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240602135005_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, Glasya-Labolas is weak to Thunder while Naamah to Physical, so make sure to bring demons that can use the Zio family of skills and that can unleash powerful physical attacks. The best strategy is to get rid of Naamah first, as she can charm your party members. To do so quickly, enter the battle with full Magatsuhi, use Omagotoki: Critical, and go all out on her with physical attacks. If you have Ippon-Datara with you, use Beatdown at full HP for the best effect. The Bestial Bite skill works rather well, too, as it is stronger when it deals critical damage, which is guaranteed under the effects of Omagotoki: Critical. In case you are charmed, use the Patra skill to heal the altered condition as quickly as possible. Once Naamah has gone down, dealing with Glasya-Labolas is rather easy. Unleash your Zio skills, keep your health up, and use buffs and debuffs as needed.</p>
<p>As for the demons that can make this <a href="https://atlus.com/smt5v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a> boss fight much easier, besides the aforementioned Ippon-Datara, you should bring Andras and Shiisaa. The first is resistant to charm, and if it has the Patra skill, you will be able to get a reliable status-condition healer for this fight. The second comes with an innate skill called Guardian Beast that counters with Thunder-elemental attacks when attacked with an element the demon resists or can null. As Glasya-Labolas uses Force attacks, against which Shisaa is resistant, the skill will activate multiple times during the battle, dealing damage with an element against which Glasya Labolas is weak.</p>

		<p>It’s a hard life, being a rat. First off, no one thinks you are cute. Secondly, the bubonic plague is on you. Thirdly, you have a tendency to get embroiled in vicious blood-thirsty wars with rival armies of animals. For an example of the latter, take the first Tails of Iron, which pitted hero Redgi and pals against ferocious bands of fearsome frogs. Now, with the frog menace having taken their last ribbit, it’s the turn of some undead Bats to invade a Ratty Kingdom. Thankfully for Redgi, this is not the southern kingdom that he rules over, instead, it’s the Rats of the North who get brutally murdered by an invading army. And they do, in outstandingly gory fashion, during our hands-on preview with Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4S1aPj_ip4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who didn’t have the good fortune of playing through its fantastic forebear, Tails of Iron 2 is best summed up as a 2D Souls-like. The diminutive player character – a bearded and surprisingly cute rat named Arlo – must hack and chop their way through a vast environment, taking on hordes of massive foes. The foes are glorious to behold, painted and animated with arresting hand-drawn visuals. In our preview, we took on what can only be described as an enormous mutant porcupine, as well as a nasty bat warrior who rode a wyvern into battle. They were both utter pests, killing poor Arlo many times before we were able to identify their attack patterns and finally emerge bat-tered (pun absolutely intended) and victorious. The satisfaction this hard-earned triumph earned resulted in quite the squeak of exultation.</p>


<p>Just like its prequel, Tails of Iron 2 doesn’t pull any paws. This is a tough, yet eminently fair, game. Arlo has the same precise skill set as Redgi before him; a nimble roll to dodge unstoppable attacks and a deeply satisfying parry to open foes up to a world of hurt. And Arlo can certainly dish out the punishment, wielding swords, spears, and – our favourite – a particularly devastating axe. The attacks can be dished out with light and heavy swings, as well as a deadly charged strike that, whilst it leaves you vulnerable to counter-attacks, can slice through most minor foes with gleeful abandon. In short, it’s the same tight combat that made Tails of Iron such a critical darling.</p>


<p>There are some neat additions to the formula though. Weapons must be sharpened as they are used, requiring a frantic tap of the button – and the pause of a nail-nibblingly tense animation – before you can resume combat. It’s a heart-in-the-mouth moment as you are left completely vulnerable, demanding deft timing and the offer of an additional level of challenge that will test even the most experienced players. Then there’s the grappling hook, which proves a tantalising tease. Whilst its uses are frustratingly limited in the demo, this tool could well prove a thrilling addition to exploration and combat, giving Arlo an additional level of mobility and the environment he explores the opportunity of greater height and scale.</p>
<p>Also teased is a much deeper hunting experience. Enemies can be hacked up to provide all sorts of goodies to upgrade and customise weapons and armour. Whilst the preview didn’t offer much more than the basics of this mechanic, it could become a fantastic feature to allow players to make their own unique Arlo with accompanying combat style.</p>

<p>In short, Tails of Iron 2 is more of the same, though this time with an arresting Game-of-Thrones-Winter-is-Coming aesthetic. Quite frankly, that’s more than enough to leave us very excited to get our teeth sunk into the full game upon release.</p>

			<p>The brief appearance of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake during the Ubisoft Forward conference certainly made fans happy, since they <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a commitment from the publisher on the release year: 2026.</p>
<p>Following that brief teaser, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT/first-details-on-the-remake-of-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> more details on the long-awaited game in an interview published on the official blog. The Creative Director and Game Director explained that the project is taking so long partly because other game remakes (likely a reference to Final Fantasy VII, first and foremost) have raised the quality bar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bio</strong> <strong>Jade</strong> <strong>Adam</strong> </em><em><strong>Granger:</strong></em><em>&nbsp;The landscape of remakes has evolved a lot since the first inception of the remake of Sands of Time. There have been some big players that clearly redefined the bar. We made some big changes to the 3Cs (Character, Camera, Controls), and had to build prototypes to make sure that our new controls still feel good with the old gameplay, and sometimes we need to change them.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Michael McIntyre:</strong> I think combat is a good example. The original combat, for a lot of players today, would feel quite dated. Combat in games like Prince of Persia has advanced a lot in the 21 years since that game, and certain recent games, like Dark Souls and God of War, have really elevated even more casual players' competency in combat. It is an area where modernity really needed to be injected.</em></p>
<p>The developers also said one of the main improvements from the original game's story is that Farah will be more present throughout the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake.</p>
<p><em><strong>Michael McIntyre: </strong>Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Bio Jade Adam Granger</strong>: One of the things that's very dear to me is modernizing Farah. While she was a great character in the original, I think she lacked agency and depth as a person. So we really make her a true companion; she has reasons to be there, she's a true ally, but also a full-fledged person with a background, wants, needs, desires, and tastes. We really want to revamp her as a great character, even if she's not playable.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Ubisoft Montréal is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported </a>by the Toronto studio as well as other studios such as Bucharest, Paris, and Pune. While they wait for this remake, Prince of Persia fans can check out the progress of the roguelike spin-off that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early access a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>We haven't written much about <em>Ara: History Untold</em>, a new historical turn-based strategy PC game that's been in the works for a few years now. Part of that's because its publisher, Xbox Game Studios, hasn't put much fanfare behind it; it wasn't even mentioned in Microsoft's not-E3 extravaganza last week.</p>
<p>But perhaps both we and Microsoft should be putting more of a spotlight on it, given that it now has a release date: September 24, 2024. The game will be released on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC simultaneously.</p>
<p>The date was announced during an Official Xbox Podcast interview (and accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>) with Marc Meyer, president of Oxide Games, the studio developing <em>Ara</em>. The podcast covered more than just the release date, though, with Meyer offering up some new gameplay details—particularly about how multiplayer will work.</p>
<p>But first, here's a quick primer on exactly what Ara is since we haven't covered it previously. Essentially, it's a new spin on the classic PC game <em>Civilization</em>. As in that game, you lead a society from sticks and stones to the modern age. You explore a randomly generated world, build cities, research technologies, manage armies, and conduct diplomacy turn by turn along the way.</p>
<p>The game promises a mix of familiar mechanics and new ones. You can generally assume most of the familiar mechanics will come by way of<em> Civilization</em> or other popular 4x genre titles like <em>Stellaris</em>—things like leaders with different traits and building specific structures within cities, including wonders of the world.
</p><p>In terms of what's different, the game offers a more robust simulation of what the citizens of your society are doing as they trek around the map and react to phenomena like weather or illness. In fact, the game's evolutionary approach to AI was the topic of a dense but compelling if-you-understand-the-concepts talk at the Game Developer's Conference earlier this year.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><em>Ara</em> also features a sophisticated crafting economy, a non-linear tech tree, and the ability to zoom in and out from a global level to see individual citizens going about their business in the streets and fields.</p>
<h2>New multiplayer gameplay details</h2>
<p>During the podcast, Meyer shared details about how multiplayer will work, and that promises some improvements over <em>Civilization</em> as well. The game runs in the cloud, and is persistently going on whether you're logged in or not. That blurs the lines between the old play-by-email games and live multiplayer. When multiple players are logged in at once, it has a system that allows them to perform most of the tasks for their turns simultaneously. Alternatively, players can just log in, make some moves, log out, and come back to it later, allowing for asynchronous play without much hassle.</p>
<p>Meyers described the simultaneous turns this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>The way that works is you submit your actions, and everyone else in the world submits their actions at the same time, and then they all get resolved together. It's not a situation where if you go first, you get to get the claim; the person who goes second doesn't get the claim. In this model, everyone goes at the same time. So, in multiplayer you really have a fair chance at everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also noted that players may optionally cede control to an AI if they decide to stop playing a multiplayer match, allowing other players to finish.</p>
<p>There have been some other challengers to the <em>Civilization</em> throne—Amplitude's <em>Humankind </em>comes to mind—but so far not many have managed to fully compete. With <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/leaked-logo-points-to-imminent-civilization-vii-announcement/"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> also just announced, <em>Ara: History Untold</em> is going to have to stand out. We'll find out just how much it does this September.</p>
<p>Fortunately for <em>Ara</em>, it'll have room on the stage to itself for a while, as <em>Civilization VII</em> isn't expected to launch until next year.</p>

<p>Gamers of a certain age may remember Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch line, which predated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/">cartridge-based Game Boy</a> by offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/play-tamagotchi-mc-hammer-and-more-lcd-handheld-wonders-in-your-browser/">simple, single-serving LCD games</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/rare-nintendo-game-watch-unit-fetches-9000-at-auction/">fetch a pretty penny at auction today</a>. But even most ancient gamers probably don't remember Mego's "Time Out" line, which took the internal of Nintendo's early Game &amp; Watch titles and rebranded them for an American audience that hadn't yet heard of the Japanese game maker.
</p><p>Now, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has helped preserve <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">the original film of an early Mego Time Out commercial</a>, marking the recovered, digitized video as "what we believe is the first commercial for a Nintendo product in the United States." The 30-second TV spot—which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVT5i1muxE">now available in a high-quality digital transfer</a> for the first time—provides a fascinating glimpse into how marketers positioned some of Nintendo's earliest games to a public that still needed to be sold on the very idea of portable gaming.</p>
<h2>Imagine an “electronic sport”</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/game2.jpg" data-height="700" data-width="537" alt="A 1980 Mego catalog sells Nintendo's Game &amp;amp; Watch games under the toy company's &quot;Time Out&quot; branding."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/game2.jpg" data-height="700" data-width="537">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A 1980 Mego catalog sells Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch games under the toy company's "Time Out" branding.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Founded in the 1950s, Mego made a name for itself in the 1970s with licensed movie action figures and <a href="http://www.2xlrobot.com/index.html">early robotic toys like the 2-XL</a> (a childhood favorite of your humble author). In 1980, though, Mego branched out to partner with a brand-new, pre-<em>Donkey Kong</em> Nintendo of America to release rebranded versions of four early Game &amp; Watch titles: <em>Ball</em> (which became Mego's "Toss-Up"), <em>Vermin</em> ("Exterminator"), <em>Fire</em> ("Fireman Fireman"), and <em>Flagman</em> ("Flag Man").</p>
<p>While Mego would go out of business by 1983 (long before <a href="https://megofigures.com/">a 2018 brand revival</a>), in 1980, the company had the pleasure and responsibility of introducing America to Nintendo games for the first time, even if they were being sold under the Mego name. And while home systems like the Atari VCS and Intellivision were already popular with the American public at the time, Mego had to sell the then-new idea of simple black-and-white games you could play away from the living room TV (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvision">Milton Bradley Microvision</a> notwithstanding).</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xVT5i1muxE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>The 1980 Mego spot that introduced Nintendo games to the US, now preserved in high-resolution.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's where a TV spot from Durona Productions came in. If you were watching TV in the early '80s, you might have heard an announcer doing a bad Howard Cosell impression selling the Time Out line as "the new electronic sport," suitable as a pastime for athletes who have been injured jogging or playing tennis or basketball.</p>
<p>The ad also had to introduce even extremely basic gaming functions like "an easy game and a hard game," high score tracking, and the ability to "tell time" (as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/639593-far-out-in-the-uncharted-backwaters-of-the-unfashionable-end">Douglas Adams noted</a>, humans were "so amazingly primitive that they still [thought] digital watches [were] a pretty neat idea"). And the ad made a point of highlighting that the game is "so slim you can play it anywhere," complete with a close-up of the unit fitting in the back pocket of a rollerskater's tight shorts.</p>
<h2>Preserved for all time</h2>
<p>This early Nintendo ad wasn't exactly <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home">"lost media"</a> before now; you could find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p49nY1dyq2M">fuzzy</a>, video-taped <a href="http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/m/v/4640/">versions</a> online, including variations that talk up the pocket-sized games as sports "where size and strength won't help." But the Video Game History Foundation has now digitized and archived a much higher quality version of the ad, courtesy of an original film reel discovered in an online auction by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2021/07/collectors-are-as-confused-as-you-are-about-that-1-56m-super-mario-64-sale/">game collector</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2/">former game journalist</a>) Chris Kohler. Kohler acquired the rare 16 mm film and provided it to VGHF, which in turn reached out to film restoration experts at <a href="http://www.movettefilm.com/">Movette Film Transfer</a> to help color-correct the faded, 40-plus-year-old print and encode it in full 2K resolution for the first time.
</p><p>This important historical preservation work is as good an excuse as any to remember a time when toy companies were still figuring out how to convince the public that Nintendo's newfangled portable games were something that could fit into their everyday life. As VGHF's Phil Salvador <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">writes</a>, "it feels laser-targeted to the on-the-go yuppie generation of the '80s with disposable income to spend on electronic toys. There’s shades of how Nintendo would focus on young, trendy, mobile demographics in their more recent marketing campaigns… but we’ve never seen an ad where someone plays Switch in the hospital."</p>
