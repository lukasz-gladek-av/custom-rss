            <p>
Microsoft is utilising AI to assist with identifying harmful content and ensure the gaming community is kept safe when playing games online.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/">blog post for its Xbox Transparency Report</a>, the company reiterated its "advancements in promoting player safety" and "commitment to transparency", as well as its "progressive approach to leveraging AI".
</p>
<p>
There are two specific ways in which AI is being used: auto labelling and image pattern matching.
</p>
<figure><div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The former uses AI to identify harmful words or phrases from player reports, allowing community moderators to quickly sort out false reports and focus on the most critical instances.
</p>
<p>
The latter similarly uses image matching techniques to rapidly identify and remove harmful and toxic imagery.
</p>
<p>
The use of AI here follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-releases-new-voice-reporting-feature-to-combat-toxic-in-game-voice-chat">last year's introduction of a new voice reporting feature</a>, which allows Xbox players to capture video clips of in-game voice chat to submit to the Xbox Safety Team for review.

</p>
<p>
Xbox says it has captured 138k voice records since the launch of the feature. When those reports resulted in an enforcement strike, 98 percent of players showed improved behaviour and did not receive further enforcements.
</p>
<p>
Last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-adds-enforcement-strike-system-to-improve-safety-and-transparency">Xbox introduced an enforcement strike system</a>, matching bad behaviour with a strike of appropriate severity. Since launch, 88 percent of players receiving a strike did not receive further enforcement. 

</p>
<p>
It's a positive step, then, with AI reducing the human cost of reviewing toxic content.
</p>
<p>
Still, toxicity and misogyny remain widespread in gaming voice chat. A post from Twitch streamer Taylor Morgan went viral this week due to the harmful abuse she received while playing a match of Riot's Valorant (beware of the language in the clip below).
</p>
<p>
"The suspensions are not enough. Nothing will ever stop these men from acting this way until hardware bans go into play. They should never be able to play the game again," she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up post she revealed she received a penalty for leaving the game early.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I have never made a more desperate plea that what I am about to say right now. <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riotgames</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RiotSupport</a> I need you guys to fucking do something.

<p>
Examples like this highlight there is still a long way to go to improve the safety of playing games online. And while Microsoft's use of AI is seemingly positive, it's worth remembering the company last year laid off its entire AI ethics and society team as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-set-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs">part of 10,000 job losses across the company</a> (as highlighted at the time by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638823/microsoft-ethics-society-team-responsible-ai-layoffs">The Verge</a>). Its Office of Responsible AI does remain, however, which published its <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/">Responsible AI Standard guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Microsoft is certainly pushing the benefits of AI. In November last year it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-offering-generative-ai-tools-to-its-studios">"multi-year co-development partnership" with Inworld AI</a> to provide Xbox's studios with AI tools such as a design copilot and character runtime engine.

</p>
<p>
Such generative AI tools have, previously, been met with "reverence and rage", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-games-industrys-response-to-ai-reverence-and-rage">Eurogamer reported from last year's GDC event</a>.

</p>
<p>
More recently, a report by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">Unity claimed that 62 percent of studios are already utilising AI</a>, with animation the top usage.

Rejoice!</p>
<p>Sometimes, as was the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-global-release-timings">city-builder&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em></a>, certain regions will need to wait until the day after most other regions to play games thanks to the way time zones work, but that's not the case with Ninja Theory's upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2&nbsp;</em>starts off with an early release on the West Coast of the USA and ends with an evening launch in New Zealand, so everyone will get to check out Senua's latest journey on May 21st.</p>

<p>Like the first game, you'll take control of the Pictish warrior Senua as she embarks on a journey, during which she'll have to battle her inner demons and come to terms with her mental health struggles.</p>
<p>The game is shaping up to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-reveals-beautiful-screenshots-made-with-photo-mode">pretty beautiful one</a> to look at thanks to its visual fidelity and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-dev-diary">facial capture system</a>, which is probably why you're going to need a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-pc-system-requirements">relatively beefy PC</a> to run it at 4K in 60fps.</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 21st.

"I’ll have something a bit more put together to say in the not too distant future, so please stay tuned." He than laughed: "It might be Nier, it might not be Nier.

But the company does not report console sales figures — perhaps with good reason. Now, one analyst has provided an estimated PS5 to Xbox Series X and S ratio that gives us an idea of just how far behind Microsoft has fallen when it comes to console sales.</p><p>Daniel Ahmad, Director of Research and Insights at Niko Partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464370742349967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say the firm’s estimates put the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S at 5:1 for the quarter.

But the gap is clearly widening. If that 2:1 ratio is accurate, Xbox Series X and S has sold around 29 million units at best, given PS5 has sold 59.3 million so far. For comparison’s sake, Xbox One ended up selling 58 million. It seems unlikely Xbox Series X and S will beat that figure.</p><p>Perhaps the huge gap between PS5 and Xbox Series X and S shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, given Microsoft’s clear shift away from the console as the be-all and end-all of its gaming ambitions. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-xbox-has-lost-the-console-wars-as-it-battles-for-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout">Microsoft has admitted Xbox has lost the console war</a>, and there’s little sign Xbox will catch PlayStation this generation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-bring-hades-ii-into-dungeons-dragons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the Early Access release of Supergiant Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii"><em>Hades II</em></a>, players are going wild. For something <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression">still in development</a>, the game is packed with compelling content. Furthermore, since most enjoyers of TTRPGs like to take ideas from media as story fuel for their <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaign, there's a high chance some players out there want to bring some <em>Hades II</em> to their tables.</p>
<p>In that spirit, allow us to DMs some helpful tips for bringing some of Zagreus and Melinoe's antics into the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<p>First, there are two restrictions I am putting on myself with this list. First and foremost, I will do my best to keep my suggestions to rules and systems found in the official material provided by Wizards of the Coast. This is not meant to discount third-party or homebrew material, but more a matter of discipline. Feasibly, any of these rules should be easy to implement into any campaign with minimal effect on game balance or tone.</p>
<p>Second, I am focusing on translating certain gameplay systems and mechanics to the table, not aesthetic, genre, or narrative elements. If you want a Greek-themed <em>D&amp;D</em> setting with thematically appropriate material, the<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-and-magic-gathering-worlds-collide-in-mythic-odysseys-of-theros">Mythic Odysseys of Theros</a></em> supplement is a great place to start.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-ii-weapon-hall.jpg?itok=q5a-B-1C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-ii-weapon-hall.jpg?itok=Ej7aGh8H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How in the world do we make these work?</figcaption></figure><h2>Bringing <em>Hades II</em> To <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> – Boons and Weapon Aspects</h2>
<p>In <em>Hades II</em>, every time you clear a room of enemies you obtain a random boon from one of the Greek gods. These boons can drastically change your playstyle as you progress. In addition, there are Daedalus Hammers, which can improve your weapons.</p>
<p>How do you bring some of that power and spontaneity to a game like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>? A TTRPG whose experience can range from one-shot dungeon crawls with close friends to year-long epic campaigns full of drama and explosive setpieces?</p>
<p>First, we'll cover Boons since it's the easiest. In Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, there is a section on alternative rewards to treasure and magic items. That section discusses Supernatural Gifts, which come in two forms. Blessings permanently boost a character's stats or give them the benefits of a certain magic item. Charms give players access to more potent abilities but vanish permanently once used several times.</p>
<p>Both of these gifts can be used for Boons. Blessings let players feel stronger than others thanks to going that extra mile, and charms provide a bit of tactical thinking on their end. The section even mentions such gifts can be given to adventurers by the gods either in advance of a perilous quest or as a reward for doing something so spectacular they take notice. Something spectacular as, say Melinoe's dire quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-supernatural-blessings-excerpt.jpg?itok=OgB2m-j2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-supernatural-blessings-excerpt.jpg?itok=BwshrnaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tired: Giving out magic items. Wired: Giving out Blessings.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapon upgrades on the other hand are trickier. Part of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> core design is discarding older gear for better ones as you level up and progress through greater challenges. In many respects, you are encouraged not to get attached to a weapon because a +1 weapon may be around the corner.</p>
<p>Once again, Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> provides an answer. Under Sentient Magic Items, there is a section discussing Artifacts. In the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, Artifacts are powerful magic items from the ancient past. They are designed to be packed full of unimaginable power well beyond what is readily available.</p>
<p>It also has some handy charts on how to make your own. In addition to having a blacksmith turn your Fighter's regular weapon into a magical +1 weapon, roll once on the Minor Beneficial Properties chart and give it the corresponding benefit. Now that magical sword can cast Dimension Door or protect the wielder from being frighened or charmed. Now it has more personality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-ii-chaos-challenge-choices.jpg?itok=ci7MLcZt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-ii-chaos-challenge-choices.jpg?itok=XbHtW3Fq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The risks are tricky, but the rewards are so tempting.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bringing <em>Hades II</em> To <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> – Chaos Challenges, Heat Levels, and Training Mirror</h2>
<p>In <em>Hades II</em>, Melinoe can accept challenges from the primordial Chaos. These challenges force the player to fight temporarily with a penalty or restriction. The trade-off is once this challenge is completed, the player gets a major benefit.</p>
<p>A more extreme version of this idea can be found with <em>Hades'</em> Heat Levels. These are optional increases to difficulty. More enemies appear. Enemies have more health. You have to clear every battle within a certain time limit. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Since both Hades and Hades II are roguelikes, a genre all about learning and adapting to increasingly daunting challenges and rotating benefits, these systems work wonderfully. If you die, you can take fewer risks on your next run.</p>
<p>They're also the trickiest idea to bring to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. For the most part, the DM dictates the difficulty of a campaign, and character death is due to either bad luck or poor player decisions.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a way to bring these challenges to a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaign. Introduce these challenges as an optional gimmick of a dungeon the players need to traverse or a scripted section. Keep the timetables short. The duration of a dungeon crawl at least; an in-game day at most.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-minor-detriment-chart-screenshot.jpg?itok=H0Nsi_K2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-minor-detriment-chart-screenshot.jpg?itok=bsq4XLpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>DMs, a bit of forethought and these detriments can be nastier than expected.</figcaption></figure><p>For restrictions, we'll be utilizing the Minor and Major Detrimental Properties charts in the Artifact section of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. As part of the challenge, the player is given a magic item they must bring to the end of the dungeon. Roll on the respective charts and play out how the detriments hinder the party. Use minor effects if you want to inconvenience the group or major effects for something spicier.</p>
<p>For something more active, you can impose penalties on PCs using unique character resources. Inflicting psychic damage on a character if they cast spells above a certain level or using a barbarian rage. If you impose a time limit, introduce force damage after several turns passes in a battle.</p>
<p>But what do you roll for damage? In Chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> under Traps, there is a handy chart for adjudicating traps. use the Damage Severity By Level Chart as you see fit. These challenges are essentially activating a trap when certain criteria are met after all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-damage-severity-by-level-screenshot.jpg?itok=IlqTgui4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-damage-severity-by-level-screenshot.jpg?itok=1VRM2AeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A handy tool for any DM out there that needs to calculate damage quickly.</figcaption></figure><p>But how should the DM reward the players for this extra effort? There are two different avenues for this. One is consulting the Treasure Tables in Chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> and rolling on it for some extra treasure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can consult <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything's</em> section on rewarding magic items to the party. Go to the Magic Item Ingredients chart, found under Downtime Activities, consult the chart to determine the rarity of an item based on the CR – increased by 1-3 based on the severity of the challenges – then hand the participating players a fitting magic item from the book. For more guidance, consult the section in <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything</em> on rewarding magic items.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is Zagreus' Mirror of Night. In <em>Hades</em>, this was used to give the player ongoing persistent bonuses they can take on each run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-zagreus-in-front-of-mirror.jpg?itok=eLB-7Wof 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-zagreus-in-front-of-mirror.jpg?itok=Itfhe5bD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With enough gold, I should be able to get a bit of an edge.</figcaption></figure><p>This may be the easiest thing to implement into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. In chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, the Other Rewards section mentions Training. A player can receive training from an esteemed mentor or master wizard, gaining additional benefits. This ranges from having Inspiration every day for a few days, gaining new skill proficiencies or just getting a new Feat. As for cost, Chapter 6 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> covers training to gain additional levels under Downtime Activities. But the training there can take weeks or months, and leveling up is a much bigger reward than the ones listed. Alternatively, <em>Xanathar's Guide To Everything</em> mentions a mentor would cost 25 gold per workweek.</p>
<p>Have a player invest some gold, have the mentor be a mystical magic mirror, let them build up to a reward over one or two weeks, and you're good to go.</p>
<p>Naturally, these are suggestions for bringing <em>Hades II</em> into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. House rules and custom material is always an option depending on your table. But for those just starting in this hobby, these suggestions above may help give you that extra creative spark.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a past employee at Volition, Saints Row (2022) sold around 1.7 million units total before the developer was shut down.</p>



<p>Spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@bogorad222</a>, Saints Row’s community and social media manager on LinkedIn revealed that the game sold 1.7 million units.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to Embracer Groups 3rd quarter earnings call for 2022, Saints Row cost more than $100 million to develop. The game originally released for $70, which would have seen the studio gain a profit of 19 million dollars, however, soon after the games release, the sale price of the game was decreased likely in part to its poor reception. </p>



<p>The game received mixed to average reviews by critics and was slammed online by players due to the games mass amount of bugs and quantity. In November 2022, Embracer Group stated that&nbsp;Saints Row&nbsp;“did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized”, but financially “performed in line with management expectations in the quarter.”</p>



<p>In August 2023, one year on from the games release, Embracer Group closed down Volition and moved its Red Faction and Saints Row IP to Plaion.</p>



<p>What did you think of Saints Row’s 2022 release? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p data-characters="260" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> is the latest FPS targeting Call of Duty’s crown, but if you don’t own a PC and haven’t upgraded to a next-gen console, will you be able to get in on the action?

It should come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-xdefiant-be-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> players and next-gen console owners will get to try it, but what about those who haven’t upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S yet? </p> <figure data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Last-gen console owners are getting left behind.

 <h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-on-ps4" data-injectable="false">Is <em>XDefiant</em> on PS4?</h2> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false"><strong>No, <em>XDefiant</em> is not going to release on PlayStation 4. </strong>The game has not been developed for last-gen consoles, so if you haven’t upgraded to a PS5 yet, the unfortunate news is that you’re out of luck. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is <em>XDefiant</em> on Xbox One?</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unfortunately, <em>XDefiant</em> will not be on the Xbox One either. </strong>The game will be released on the Xbox Series X|S, but Ubisoft has decided not to use the last-gen consoles. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Why is <em>XDefiant </em>not on PS4 or Xbox One?</h2> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">When asked by a fan on X, formerly Twitter, Ubisoft explained that the development team wanted “to keep a consistent standard of quality for the game,” which led them to focus on current-gen systems only. </p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Because current-gen consoles are more powerful than their predecessors, the developer can do much more in terms of graphic fidelity and frames-per-second, which the PS4 and Xbox One couldn’t handle. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Could <em>XDefiant</em> release on PS4 and Xbox One in the future?</h2> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Look, we’ll never say never, but it seems very unlikely that this will happen. In my opinion, if you were doing a last-gen console release, you would need to do it at launch, as the longer you wait, the less worthwhile it is. If Ubisoft were to release a version for PS4 and Xbox One in a years time, would it really be worth the effort when most people have already upgraded? It seems unlikely. </p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">Instead, the team will likely focus on improving the game and adding new maps, modes, and weapons. </p>

<p>In our original Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice review, Dave wrote, <em>“Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a profound sensual experience that’s unmissable. The way it highlights psychosis and incorporates it isn’t just a part of the aesthetic, but it also makes for fascinating gameplay.

Artwork revealing characters from the under-wraps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been posted online, ahead of this evening's big reveal trailer going live. 
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to watch the Assassin's Creed Shadows reveal trailer at 5pm UK time tonight - but ahead of that, artwork which looks set to be used on the game's box cover has appeared on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft appears to have removed several instances of this image from social media already, inadvertantly confirming its authenticity, but other copies still remain. For those looking to go in completely unspoiled, look away now.

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows looks to feature two protagonists: a female ninja and a male samurai. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork of the pair shows them posing with a hatchet on a rope and, as you'd expect, a samurai sword. Is one of them wearing the series' iconic hidden blade weapon? It's hard to say for certain. 
</p>

The imagery, posted to reddit, lines up with previously-leaked details of the game - specifically that one of its main characters would be the historical figure of Yasuke, a man of African origin who travelled to Japan and later served the Japanese lord Oda Nobunaga. 
</p>
<p>
This also places the game quite firmly in time - around 1582.
</p>
<p>
As for the female ninja, leaks suggest her name is Naoe, who will have a more traditional Assassin's Creed origin story that pushes her to join the Assassins faction and battle the evil-doer Templars.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has featured dual protagonists before, of course, such as siblings Jacob and Evie Frye in the Victorian London-set Syndicate - the first major project from Shadows' own talented Ubisoft Quebec team. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Egypt-set Origins also had you play as main character Bayek's wife Aya for certain sections - with the suggestion from the game's developers that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-report-into-ubisoft-culture-highlights-reluctance-to-let-you-play-as-a-woman-in-assassins-creed">these had once been intended to be more integral</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft will officially detail Assassin's Creed Shadows later today - join us then for our first look at the game's trailer and plenty of analysis of what's in store.

NieR series producer Yosuke Saito has joined NieR series director Yoko Taro on a new project, along with series composer Keiichi Okabe.
</p>
<p>
Saito revealed the news in an interview with former Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi in the latest Famitsu magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a>).
</p>
<p>
"I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," said Saito. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."

<p>

"I'm doing various things with the idea of creating something that does not yet exist," he continued. "I can't devote my time to that fully, so most of it has been left to the staff, but it's turning into something quite interesting. I'm looking forward to the day we can announce it."
</p>
<p>
The NieR series - published by Square Enix - has proven incredibly popular, specifically the PlatinumGames developed NieR: Automata. In 2021, a remaster of NieR Replicant was released.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown what's next for the NieR series, though some fans believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoko-taro-teases-nier-3">Taro was teasing a new game in the series earlier this year</a>. Is that what Saito and Okabe are also working on? We'll have to wait and see.

</p>
<p>
Still, if you're looking for something new to play in a similar vein, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>. Taro and Stellar Blade creative director Hyung-tae Kim discussed their games together, as both share similar themes and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro even said Stellar Blade is superior to NieR: Automata</a> (he's wrong).

            <p>The upcoming Mortal Kombat film sequel has secured itself a release date.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema's Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/mortal-kombat-2-companion-weapons-release-dates-1235916567/">Deadline</a> reports. It will also play in Imax.</p>
<p>In response to this news, the film's producer Todd Garner said this somewhat far-off release date was not simply to do with how long the project is in post production. "There are numerous factors that come into play such as competitive releases, the studio's slate, marketing focus, audience availability, etc, etc, as well as availability of Imax screens," <a href="https://twitter.com/Todd_Garner/status/1790545184004116651">Garner</a> wrote on social media platform X.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mortal Kombat 2 serves as a sequel to 2021's Mortal Kombat, and is again directed by Simon McQuoid. Joining the cast for the upcoming release is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/karl-urban-reportedly-in-line-to-play-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-2">The Boys and Lord of the Rings star Karl Urban</a>, who will play Johnny Cage.</p>
<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and has been cast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor in chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it "boring".</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sony shipped five times more PlayStation 5 consoles than Microsoft managed with Xbox Series X/S in the last quarter.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, who's done some digging after Sony's latest financial report released yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 shipped 4.5m units in the last quarter, meaning Sony has now sold over 59m PS5 consoles in total. This is roughly equivalent to PS4 at the same point in its lifecycle.

<p>

Microsoft, meanwhile, has seen a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet">31 percent year-on-year drop in Xbox console sales</a>, although specific figures have not been released.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, PS5 sales dropped by 29 percent year-on-year, although console sales are up for the year as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Together it's a sign of slowing console sales across the industry, although overall sales for PlayStation consoles are significantly higher than Xbox Series X/S sales. That's matched by Sony's seeming inability to sell more consoles than the previous generation.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>5. The PlayStation 5 shipped 4.5 million units in the last quarter. According to our estimates, this is almost 5x more than the Xbox Series X|S shipped in the same period. </p><p>(This is a bonus one for the console warriors + my rent is due)</p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464370742349967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Again, diversifying income is proving integral. It's why Sony is pushing PC sales, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 now the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. The company hasn't, however, disclosed the latest PlayStation Plus subscription numbers.

</p>
<p>
It's also why Sony is using the metric of play time on PlayStation as an indicator of success. That's increased 15 percent year-on-year, reaching its second highest level ever (the highest since the pandemic).
</p>
<p>
Also announced yesterday were the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">replacements for former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>. PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst will be in charge of game development, while Hideaki Nishino will oversee hardware.

</p>
<p>
Sales in Sony's games segment increased by 17 percent year-on-year, while operating income increased by 40.2bn yen year-on-year to a 290.2bn yen total.
</p>
<p>
Still, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a>, including the closure of its London Studio.

            <p>
The Sims 4 is preparing for a summer of slinky, sexy free and paid updates according to its newly revealed roadmap, starting with a refreshed batch of swimsuits today.
</p>
<p>
There's not a huge amount to report on the free swimsuit refresh - they now come in more colours and varieties to better suit a range of body shapes and sizes - but EA notes it's also updated a few other summer-adjacent clothing items, including the tankini and wrap top, to usher in its season of sauciness.
</p>
<p>
As per the publisher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OndDCMYcsnk">new roadmap reveal video</a>, the next few steamy months will bring two free "stylish" updates, two destination kits, and one "flirtatious" expansion pack. Specifics are scarce, but we can make a few educated guesses based on EA's clues. The free updates, for instance, are accompanied by the text, "Polished my look for a sultry splash" - suggesting that, alongside today's swimsuit update, we might also be getting further enhancements to nails.

<p>
And as for those destination kits, the visuals accompanying this part of the video - as well as the text, "A little nectar led to a provocative plunge" - seem to be pointing toward kits themed around bars and public pools. The "flirtatious" expansion, however, remains largely mysterious, with the on-screen text - "Made waves, but we WooHoo'd anyway" - revealing little.
</p>
<p>
While we wait for EA to show its hand, Sims 4 players on PC can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-blooming-rooms-kit">head over to the publisher's official store</a> and pick up the plant-themed Blooming Rooms Kit - which normally costs £4.99 - for free until 31st May. This one's all about adding a bit of greenery to your Sims' lives, because what better way to prepare for the sexy summer ahead than with excessive foliage everywhere?

            <p>
American Truck Simulator's determined trundle across the picturesque highways and byways of the United States continues this week with the launch of its latest paid expansion - and 15th explorable state - Nebraska, on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
Nebraska was revealed to be in the works last August, bringing American Truck Simulator's current tally of confirmed explorable states up to 17. Since its release in 2016, the trucking sim has expanded to include California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The arrival of Nebraska this week brings us up to 15 states, and developer SCS has already announced Arkansas and Missouri are on the way.
</p>
<p>
Staying with Nebraska, though, SCS describes it thusly: "Located in the heart of the Great Plains, Nebraska's vast and diverse landscape consists of prairies, rolling hills, and the crucial Platte River. While hauling cargo through the Cornhusker State along historic routes, you will have many opportunities to witness iconic landmarks and truly immerse yourself in the state's spirit, from its pioneer history to the modern energy of cities full of ever-growing industries."

<p>
SCS' digital reimagining of Nebraska includes the cities of Lincoln and Omaha, as well as some of the state's most recognisable landmarks and attractions - with the likes of Scotts Bluff National Monument, McConaughy Lake and the Kingsley Hydroplant, the Archway, and Carhenge so far confirmed. Expect the Nebraska expansion to cost around £9.99 when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543810/American_Truck_Simulator__Nebraska/">via Steam</a> on 16th May.
</p>
<p>
In related news, SCS has just released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/4167595132252267296?l=english">American Truck Simulator's expansive 1.50 update</a> after a short public beta. This introduces enhanced rendering features - including temporal anti-aliasing support and optimised light computation - as well as a substantial UI overhaul (featuring a flatter, more minimalist design), and the third phase of its ongoing California rework, intended to bring its ageing original state inline with more recent additions.
</p>
<p>
The latter introduces two new cities - San Jose and Modesto - as well as complete reworks of San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton, Santa Cruz, Huron, and Fresno. Major routes - including CA-1, US-101, I-5, CA-99, and US-395 - have also seen major overhauls, as has Yosemite National Park. All this, alongside new lane assistant and tooltips options, is available now.

            <p>
The next Dead by Daylight chapter will be based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with Vecna as the new Killer.
</p>
<p>
News of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-teases-dark-fantasy-era-with-dungeons-dragons-themed-chapter">new chapter was teased last week</a>, but in its anniversary stream today Behaviour unveiled further details.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the new chapter, a new 2v8 mode was announced, as well as an update on spin-off titles, and a tease of a new Castlevania chapter coming later this year.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything shown at the Dead by Daylight eighth anniversary stream.

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Castlevania chapters</h2>

<p>
Dungeons &amp; Dragons will form the basis for the next chapter of Dead by Daylight, available now in the Public Test Build and launching properly on 3rd June.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the chapter will include a new Killer, a new Survivor, and a new map.
</p>
<p>
While this may seem like a move away from the horror franchises Dead by Daylight is known for, Dungeons &amp; Dragons provides plenty of dark fantasy and will introduce magic for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The new Killer will be Vecna, a powerful lich and major antagonist in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. He's voiced by Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom, Vincent in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth).
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Vecna will have four spells for players to use. Fly will allow him to traverse maps quickly; with Mage Hand Vecna can hold palettes and lift them back up; Flight of the Damned is a necromancer projectile; and Dispelling Sphere will detect and dispell magical effects.
</p>
<p>
In a further nod to D&amp;D, when Vecna is a Killer special treasure chests will be found around maps. Once opened, a d20 dice roll will take effect to determine what players find: either regular items, or magical items to counter Vecna's spells. Rolling a critical success (20) will provide players with Vecna's cursed items to teleport from lockers or turn invisible, though these items will also injure players. However, rolling a critical fail (1) will result in a nasty surprise - perhaps a mimic chest?
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PR_Screenshot_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The new Survivor is a two-in-one bard and original creation by Behaviour. Players can choose either an elf female called Aestri Yazar, or a human male called Baermar Uraz. Further, a new map called Forgotten Ruins will include a dungeon, obviously, and plenty of D&amp;D references as part of its extensive underground component.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the stream, Behaviour also teased another new chapter coming to the game this year, based on Konami's Castlevania series. This was just a tease, though further information is expected on 6th August. Presumably, Dracula will be a Killer with one of the Belmonts as a Survivor? Either way, vampires will be a welcome addition to the game.
</p>
<h2>A new 2v8 party game mode</h2>

<p>
A new 2v8 mode will be added to Dead by Daylight by the end of summer. Rather than the usual 1v4 Killer and Survivor matches, this mode will have two Killers working together against eight Survivors.
</p>
<p>
As you may expect, this will fundamentally change how the game is played, so should be considered more of a party mode than ultra competitive. There also won't be hooks, instead downed Survivors will be sent to a cage.
</p>
<p>
Perks will also be removed; instead players choose from specific classes aimed at encouraging teamwork. Killers will also have team powers to promote coordination, though only five will be available: Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress, Nurse. Maps will also be based on these Killers.
</p>
<p>
The mode will be introduced temporarily at first.
</p>
<p>What's more, Behaviour is introducing cross-progression later this summer, meaning players can continue with progress no matter which platform they play on.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2>Dead by Daylight spin-offs incoming</h2>

<p>
Behaviour provided updates on three spin-offs, one of which is available immediately for free.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, a new gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone was shown. This is a narrative horror game from Supermassive (The Quarry, Until Dawn), featuring the usual environmental puzzles, quick-time events, and the ability to shape the script through choices. It's set in 1980 and follows a group of friends creating a film, who uncover the secrets of an infamous serial killer in the process.
</p>
<p>
While no release date has been given, the developer is still aiming for a 2024 release. It will be around five to seven hours long, depending on choices made.
</p>

 </a>
</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Supermassive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Secondly, Midwinter Entertainment is working on a new PvE game known as Project T. Players will take the role of trespassers whisked away to the realm of the Entity. It will be a third-person session-based game with guns, trucks, and talismans used against new enemies the Thrall.
</p>
<p>
It remains very early in development, but the Project T Insider Programme is launching to allow for fan input and closed playtests (on PC).

 </a>
</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Behaviour</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Lastly, Behaviour is today launching What The Fog, a new two-person co-op roguelite game available for free on PC for those with a Behaviour account for a limited time (and $4.99 afterwards).
</p>
<p>
Like Jumanji, Survivors Claudette and Dwight are sucked into a cursed boardgame to battle against swarms of monsters with 3D gameplay and a cute, chibi art style. And if a player dies, they switch to support view to unleash spells until revived by their partner.

            <p>Bethesda is known for its glitchy releases. In fact, in the run up to Amazon's TV adaptation of Fallout, showrunner Graham Wagner even reminisced about a bug he came across while playing The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-the-fallout-tv-show-wont-have-bugs-at-least-not-in-season-one">adding 'glitches' into a then-hypothetical second season</a> of the show was "definitely on [his] mind as a concept".</p>
<p>But, even the studio's less recent-releases are still faced with the age-old Bethesda bug problem, and patches haven't been able to sort them. In fact, it seems they have sometimes made them worse</p>
<p>Case in point, we have Fallout 4, which is currently having a resurgence thanks to Amazon's show. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">Bethesda finally released its long-awaited 'next-gen' patch</a> that included the promise of native applications for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, while those on higher-spec PCs would get widescreen and ultra-widescreen support. However, this patch was met with a mixed response, as it broke mods and only one of the game's two graphical options appeared to be working on Xbox Series X and S.</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-latest-graphical-update-is-here">Bethesda released another patch for Fallout 4</a> across platforms. This, the studio said, would allow players to "manage your control over the game's graphic fidelity or performance" and address a number of other issues players have been experiencing. And while some of these niggles have been fixed, others have not. Oh, and mods are shot again.</p>
<p>A quick scan over on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/">Steam's Fallout 4 forums</a> show a number of unimpressed players asking Bethesda to please stop updating the game. In a post titled "How bad is the update?", which was started soon after the initial next-gen patch went live but has been constantly added to since, players are reporting mods have once again been broken and other issues haven't been fixed.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/comments/1cre6uj/another_update_has_hit_the_fallout_4_modding/">Another update has hit the Fallout 4 modding community</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thewaffleofoz/">u/Thewaffleofoz</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSFalloutL/">TrueSFalloutL</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Also as pointed out, most of yesterday's update didn't actually target issues on PC, with consoles being the main focus. Another thread said the Fallout 4 team is still to fix bugs they believe should be "mandatory".</p>
<p>"What with black screen after launch on monitors 144 hz and above? What with weapon debris problem on rtx cards? Those two problems are known from couple years and still isn't official fixed from bethesda. This is a joke," it reads.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Bethesda for comment on how it plans to address mods and other issues in the future.</p> <div>

<p>This current spate of 'next-gen' grievances aside, Fallout 4 has proved popular ever since the TV series released in April. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">topped the PS4 download charts last month</a>, while Fallout generally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-has-more-than-doubled-its-player-counts-on-steam">"more than doubled its concurrent players" on Steam</a> over the weekend of 14th April.</p>

        <p>Decision contains "significant factual errors", Epic Games says.</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>    <div>



            <p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games has said it will fight back against a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator, which has accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". 
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game">investigation by The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets</a> (ACM) claims Epic Games "exploited the vulnerabilities of children" through "various design choices for its offerings in its Item Shop". 
</p>
<p>
This included, the ACM says, using ads aimed at encouraging kids to make purchases with slogans such as "get it now", and "misleading" sale countdown timers that gave the impression certain items would be removed from sale before they ultimately were. The ACM states Fortnite therefore violated "requirements of professional diligence".
</p>

<p>
In Epic Games' response, shared with Eurogamer, the company says the ACM's decision contains "significant factual errors about how Fortnite and the Item Shop operate" and that "the ACM is mandating changes that would result in a poor experience for players", which it will now appeal. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, however, Epic Games says it will make a change so Dutch players under the age of 18 "will not be able to see or purchase items that are in the shop for less than 48 hours, beginning 24th May".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the ACM's decision, Epic Games noted it had already made a number of recent Item Shop changes, and had recently said it was adding a date to each item in the Item Shop so players could see how long it would be on sale for. This will be visible as of 24th May, and is designed to remove some of the vagueness around how long certain items might be available.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' statement on the matter goes on to highlight the other child safety features available in the game, such as Cabined Accounts with limited features and no purchase options by default for users under 16, plus other parental controls and spending limits. 
</p>
<p>
While hefty, the ACM's fine is nothing compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-games-slapped-by-520m-ftc-fine">eye-opening $520m (£427m) penalty slapped down by the US Federal Trade Commission against Epic Games</a> in December 2022. That similarly related to so-called "dark patterns" meant to encourage spending. Epic Games did not contest that fine, and acknowledged at the time that its game had evolved considerably over time.

            <p>Supergiant has discussed its first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> post-launch patch, which will be released at some point later this month.</p>
<p>While the team delivered smaller hotfixes periodically since Hades 2 was released in early access, this patch will include some more meaty changes, including ones focused on resource gathering and getting around.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a>, Supergiant said it didn't want gathering resources to "feel too frustrating" for players, so this will be addressed in some fashion in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The developer also said it has ideas for how to improve Melinoë's dash and sprint. "It's important to us that Melinoë [has] her own distinct style, and for players to be able to navigate her battles and other interactions in a nimble, responsive, expressive way," Supergiant elaborated, perhaps acknowledging at the moment she can feel very similar to control as Zagreus from the first Hades.</p>
<p>We can expect more details on Hades 2's first patch - which will also include other yet-to-be-specified refinements - closer to release. We will keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>After this first patch, the studio said it will probably have "at least" one more patch in the pipeline. Then, it will shift its focus onto its first 'Major Update' for Hades 2. This is still some months away, but Supergiant said it will include new features and content. Also, the team doesn't plan on implementing <em>too </em>many balance changes just yet.</p>

<p>Our Chris Donlan has been hands-on with Supergiant's first-ever sequel, and while it "may feel very comfortable and familiar", he believes Hades 2's "best weapon remains the power of surprise".</p>
<p>"Hades 2 often strikes me as more of the same at the moment, but - two things again! - one: maybe I'm not yet dialled in sufficiently to see the deeper, secret point of the whole thing. And, two: we're right at the start of this journey and it would not surprise me if the game I'm playing today, a game I already love, is not the game I'm playing a year from now," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's Hades 2 review</a>. "And that's quite a thought."</p>

The long-rumoured The Legend of Zelda Lego set based on The Great Deku Tree will feature two different designs, according to the latest leaks.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.bricktastic.nl/lego/lego-77092-zelda-the-great-deku-tree-verschijnt-vermoedelijk-in-september-2024-update/">Bricktastic</a> reports (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-lego-zelda-great-deku-tree-will-be-released-in-september-for-e300-its-claimed/">VGC</a>), the set will be released in September and allow builders to choose between an Ocarina of Time design with green leaves, or a Breath of the Wild design with pink leaves.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the set will come with four minifigures representing Classic Link, Classic Young Link, Breath of the Wild Link and Breath of the Wild Zelda, and will also include shield and ocarina pieces.

<p>

The set will comprise 2500 bricks with a retail price of €299.99.
</p>
<p>
These details are in-line with previous rumours from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/great-deku-tree-lego-set-will-be-released-later-this-year-leaker-suggests">earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-lego-zelda-set-seemingly-confirmed-by-copyright-removals">last year</a>.


</p>
<p>
Could we see an official announcement soon? After all, Tears of the Kingdom celebrates its one year anniversary this week.
</p>
<p>
The Zelda set would follow other Nintendo sets, like the previously released Mario sets and Animal Crossing sets. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Lego Super Mario Kart set</a> will launch next year, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">K.K.

            <p>
The hugely-popular Helldivers 2 has sold 12m copies on PC and PlayStation 5, enough to become Sony's fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks in large part to its wild success on Steam, the PlayStation-published breakout hit shifted around 1m more than the previous record holder, 2022's God of War Ragnarök. 
</p>
<p>
Sony confirmed the sales record today in its just-published financial results, which also revealed a new running total for PS5 console sales: 59.3m, meaning the hardware stands roughly equivalent to where PS4 was at the same point in its lifecycle.

<p>
That 59.3m includes an impressive 20.8m PS5 consoles sold in the past 12 months alone, up 1.7m on the amount it sold in the year prior, though Sony had expected to shift even more - originally it had forecasted yearly sales of 25m. 
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, Sony said it would sell fewer consoles in the current financial year (18m in the 12 months ending 31st March 2025) which currently looks to be quiet for first-party PlayStation game launches. We are expecting the souped-up PS5 Pro console variant at some point nearer Christmas, however. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes 🤯</p><p>What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Helldivers2</a>.

<p>
Brighter points in Sony's financial results included software game sales being up year-on-year (77 percent of sales are now digital) and a boost to PlayStation Network monthly active users (118 million, up 10 million year-on-year). </p>
<p>
Once again, Sony did not disclose PlayStation Plus subscriber numbers, however.
</p>
<p>
Sony today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">confirmed its permanent replacements for now-departed former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a>. Two men will now share the CEO role, with PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst focused on game development and Hideaki Nishino overseeing PlayStation hardware. Both will report into PlayStation chairman Hiroki Totoki, who has been overseeing the business since Ryan's departure.
</p>
<p>
The outgoing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan left PlayStation in March after nearly 30 years at Sony</a>. His era ended with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">job losses amounting to some 900 staff leaving the business</a>, and the closure of Sony's London Studio.

            <p>Sony has announced who will replace Jim Ryan as the company's CEO.</p>
<p>In a change, the company will be led by two CEOs, with Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino both stepping into new leadership positions.</p>
<p>Hulst will serve as CEO of the new Studio Business Group, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">Sony announced</a> in a message to staff from interim CEO Hiroki Totoki. Nishino will meanwhile be appointed CEO of the company's Platform Business Group. The two will take up their new roles on 1st June, when chairman Totoki will also step away from his position as interim CEO.</p>

<p>In his new role, Hulst will be responsible for all first-party PlayStation game content, as well as bringing its franchises to new mediums such as film and television.</p>
<p>Hulst has served as head of PlayStation Studios, and previously led developer Guerrilla Games. Guerilla was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news071205killzonedev">acquired by Sony in 2005</a>. Since then, the studio has become best known for its work on the Horizon series.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future," Hulst said in a statement (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment."</p>
<p>Nishino, meanwhile, was previously SVP of Sony's Platform Experience Group. He will continue to oversee technology, products, services, and platform experience as part of his new role as CEO of the company's Platform Business Group. In addition, he will also oversee third-party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations. This will include sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals, Totoki said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino said in a statement following his appointment.</p>
<p>"I am honoured to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."</p>
<p>Both Hulst and Nishino will report to Totoki when the changes come into effect on 1st June. Towards the end of his message, Totoki stated we will hear more on Sony's plans later this month, perhaps confirming a showcase is on the cards for May.</p>
<p>"The future is incredibly bright for [Sony Interactive Entertainment] and that is thanks to all of you," Totoki closed. "Since I became Chairman in October 2023, I have been inspired by your enthusiasm, innovative approaches, and teamwork. These values will serve us well as we embark on the exciting future for SIE."</p> <div>

<p>Former CEO Jim Ryan announced he would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">retiring from Sony back in September</a>, after nearly 30 years with the company. "I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Ryan said last year.</p>
<p>Ryan left PlayStation in March, soon after the exec announced company-wide layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">equating to eight percent of its workforce</a>. This included the closure of PlayStation Studios' London Studio, plus reductions made within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Sony's Firesprite studio</a>.</p>

            <p>I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.</p>
<p>Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1788362032699555985">a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel</a> in which he challenged other developers to "take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/screenshot-saturday-mondays-you-want-screenshots-heres-screenshots">Screenshot Saturday Monday features</a>.</p><!--more-->

I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before your relaxed jaunt down the corridors of the ship you begin the game on is interrupted by a legion of saber and machine-gun wielding nose-havers. You’re stuck with just a pistol at this point, but even then, bullet impact is screen-shakingly solid. The Explorator takes the tack of throwing big groups of not-that-smart dudes in your path, and it’s very satisfying to manically click them all to death. On the negative front, it does have a stamina bar, which I reject on a spiritual level for this kind of zippy strafer. But who knows - maybe there’s a good reason for such a restriction that's yet to reveal itself? Maybe it’s hidden in the below trailer?</p>

<p>The game does seem to slant towards a touch of RPG territory. You can, for example, equip armour, visit merchants, and sort your inventory. The island itself is huge, and exploration is thus encouraged. My wishlist currently includes a few more interactable elements to populate the island with more than just vistas and shooting. Maybe a few readables? I would like to know the history of both this place and the squeaky lizards that inhabit it. Either way, this art really rattles my saber. You can check it out for yourself via The Explorator’s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015440/The_Explorator/">Steam demo</a>.</p>

            <p>Do you love the smell of napalm in the morning? If so, you'll probably love the smell of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>'s Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valheims-volcanic-ashlands-update-gets-first-proper-trailer-and-breakdown">a period of beta testing</a>. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EIQfQxQu_A">Possum</a>-esque.</p>

<p>Also in Valheim's Ashlands patch: 70+ new buildable items! 30+ new weapons! 30+ new crafting materials! 15 new food items and potions! Five new crafting station upgrades! Three new armour sets! Two new capes! A partridge in a pear tree, possibly! Developers Iron Gate Studios are also introducing new events, music and mechanics, including the ability to besiege the fortresses of the Charred using new catapults and rams. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4202496761515288277?l=english">full Steam listing</a> has detailed patch notes which spoil a few nasty surprises you might prefer to discover yourself. I will give away only this: be extra mindful of the possibility of incineration when dressing, crafting, constructing things, exploring the new biome on foot or sailing its coast.</p>
<p>The developers also have some advice about preparing for your first voyage to the Ashlands, which I am going to petrify for posterity in the shape of a blockquote, the grandest mausoleum available to modern games journalism:</p>
<blockquote>"Before you travel to the Ashlands, you should first make sure that you have defeated The Queen in the Mistlands. If you have done so on an earlier playthrough, remember that her dropped item is no longer a placeholder. Just like Eikthyr's antler lets you craft a pickaxe needed in the Black Forest, and just like The Elder drops a crypt key for the Swamps, the item from The Queen will be useful in the Ashlands! If you have the item already, you might need to toss it out of your inventory and pick it up again, for new recipes to trigger properly."</blockquote>
<p>In case it isn't already obvious, the Ashlands is a challenging environment. It's the penultimate biome in a deliberately difficult game, the developers remind us. So maybe brush up on your skills a bit in the Meadows or Black Forest before taking the plunge. You can also adjust the difficulty in the World Modifiers menu.</p>

<p>As always with Valheim updates, the new biome is also going to break a lot of existing mods, so consider uninstalling them (including modloaders that might boot mods up automatically) before playing. "If you don't want to play without mods, you will most likely have to wait a couple of days until the mod creator has updated their mod to be compatible with Valheim again," the developers note. I'm not savvy with the Valheim modding scene and am interested to know whether this last claim strikes modders as reasonable or presumptuous.</p>
<p>We're big Valheim enthusiasts round these parts. It's fourth on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a> and 13th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">best co-op games</a>. Ah, if only I could drink in the reek of roasting monster vertebrae it'd be right up there at number one. Are there any other games you wish you could smell?</p>

            <p>Thrones of Decay - the expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> that finally made it viable to steamroll the old world with a doomstack of 20 tanks, just as Franz intended - just released around three weeks ago, but developers Creative Assembly are already on their third hotfix. <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/forums/7-patch-notes-amp-announcements/threads/5233-total-war-warhammer-iii-hotfix-5-0-3">This one</a> is mainly aimed at re-balancing an overly demanding new grudge system for the Dwarfs that punished players for stopping to enjoy a swift pint of Bugman’s instead of constantly being on the offensive, but also includes so many other fixes it’s veering into larger patch territory.</p>

<p>The age of reckoning, as this new dwarf rework is called, would previously give you ten turns to collect as many grudge-points as you could hammer out of your foes. After the time was up, you’d either get buffed or penalised, depending on how you performed. The issue was that the target numbers would rapidly get too demanding, often leaving players in the lowest tier   - known as ‘Elgi’, because the Khazalid word for ‘weak’ is the same word for ‘elf’. Now, the tiers have been reworked, so that the middling tier is more of a neutral state, and the grudge-points themselves are easier to achieve. There’s much more nuance than all this, so do have a read of the full patch notes if you’re interested. Me, I’m all for having some room for beer breaks. There is, after all, only so many times you can scream “they have wronged us!” before your throat gets dry.</p>
<p>The hotfix doth not cease its bounty there, though. At a glance, there’s at least an additional 30 items on the list. Of special note is a downsizing to Kislev’s frost wyrm, from roughly the size of Dread Saurian to more in-line with a carnosaur. Huge single entities may look imposing, but the bigger they are, the more missile fire they attract. Hopefully, this should make the wyrms a bit more nimble and survivable. Elsewhere in the patch, the 'channel magic' post battle option has been fixed to stop you always losing, and steam tanks now collide into foes with a more satisfying thud.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> is turning fifteen years-old and to celebrate Mojang are running fifteen days of giveaways from May 15th until May 29th. Apparently each day will offer up "a new free Character Creator item representing a different year of Minecraft history."
</p>
<p>This also means I've been playing Minecraft for nearly fifteen years. Do I care for Character Creator items? No. Will I be signing in each day on my son's account to get him the free thing? Absolutely.

<p>Here's a trailer announcing the anniversary shenanigans, which also promises other elements to the celebration:

<p>Notch shared the first playable build of Minecraft <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.0">via the TIGSource forum on May 17th, 2009</a>. It was 49 minutes and 25 seconds before someone shares the first screenshot of something they've built. The screenshot is broken now, but it was of a one-block wide bridge. 
</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, I pay a monthly Realms Plus subscription so I can adminstrate a server for my kid and I to play on, and so I can access some Marketplace mods in the Bedrock version of the game. (I also pay separately for individual mods not included in the subscription as-and-when). I then pay a second, separate Marketplace subscription so my kid can access a bunch of skins on the Switch version of the game. The Switch version of the game crashes constantly, fails to connect to Microsoft's account system and thus denies him access to his owned items, and the Marketplace is riddled with paid-for mods that simply no longer work. Its near-total technical inadequacy has, on several occasions, reduced my son to tears of despair and frustration. I hope Game Pass fails and Microsoft sinks into the ocean.
</p>
<p>Minecraft, the game itself, remains this pure, wondrous thing, seemingly able to infinitely repel the attempts to sully it by its owners or creator. My son and I go on adventures, we roleplay, we build things. Minecraft is a toybox, a dressing-up box, a pencil case of colouring pens, and sometimes just a sunny hill. I played it in 2009 and I played it yesterday and I have no reason to doubt I'll be playing it in 2039.
</p>
<p>You'll need to log-in in-game to collect the free items each day but they'll also announce each freebie via their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/minecraft">Instagram Stories</a>, Mojang say. </p>
