                <p>Fan-made video games based on popular franchises always run the risk of having the official rights-holder step in and shut things down, but that's not happening with Spartan Survivors.</p><p>The community-developed game, which has players fighting hordes of Covenant and Flood enemies as Master Chief or the Arbiter, has been given an official blessing from Microsoft. The developers <a href="https://x.com/SpartnSurvivors/status/1937572095573283004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Microsoft reached out to them to say they "really love to see the passion" from the team. People at Microsoft apparently played the game as well. "It really is fun and we look forward to getting further in our playthrough and unlocking more stuff," the Halo representative said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuvhdWvzVw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJuvhdWvzVw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft, did, however, have one specific request for the developers. Microsoft reportedly asked the team to add language to the legal disclaimer in the game's credits and on store pages to make it ultra-clear that the project is not an official Halo game or made in partnership with Halo Studios.</p><p>This language will be added in the next update to Spartan Survivors. "We want to thank Halo Studios and Microsoft for their real sympathy toward us," the studio said.</p><p>You can <a href="https://juanggz.itch.io/spartan-survivors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Spartan Survivors today on itch.io</a> for free. The game's store page mentions that it's also coming to Xbox and Steam in 2025, but as of yet, it's unclear when that might happen. The announcement trailer can be seen above, containing the outdated language mentioning a 2024 release.</p><p>Microsoft is moving ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">its own new Halo games</a>, which are in the works at the newly rebranded Halo Studios and will run on Unreal Engine 5. Many are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">expecting some kind of big Halo release in 2026 for the franchise's 25th anniversary</a>, but as of yet, we don't know what that could be.</p>

Title Update 1.0.6 is headlined by a quest developed in collaboration with Critical Role, as well as a new, more challenging difficulty setting.</p><p>The update's new questline is called A Critical Encounter, and its narrative centers around Rufino, a character first created during Critical Role's one-off Assassin's Creed-themed series. Rufino is voice-acted by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond, and completion of the quest unlocks Rufino as an Ally. In addition to this quest, Ubisoft is also adding a Critical Role-themed weapon pack that can be purchased in the in-game store.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p>The update also adds a new Nightmare difficulty setting, designed to significantly increase the challenge that players face. Nightmare increases enemy skill and decreases the effectiveness of player abilities; enemies are not only stronger, but also faster and smarter, according to the patch notes. Players will also have to be more careful about noise; on this setting, Naoe will make a sound even while crouching.</p><p>Along with these two big content additions, the update adds a bunch of changes and tweaks to improve the game. For instance, players can now opt to remove headgear during cutscenes; Ubisoft has also added a toggle for specific VFX. Title Update 1.0.6 launches tomorrow, June 25, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 2 PM UTC; You can check out the whole list of changes in the patch notes below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to unlock Critical Role's Rufino as an Ally (image via Ubisoft). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first big collaboration that Ubisoft has done for Shadows. Back in May, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-adds-two-unexpected-crossovers-and-major-parkour-upgrades/1100-6531829/" data-ref-id="1100-6531829">launched collabs with Dead By Daylight and Balatro</a>. The company plans for more content to come in the future: According to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>, future updates will add new game plus, additional story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Patch sizes</h3><ul><li>PS5: ~6.27 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: ~19 GB</li><li>Mac: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~17 GB</li><li>Steam: ~8.5 GB</li></ul><h3>Patch Highlights</h3><h4>Critical Role</h4><p>For our second special collaboration, we partnered with Critical Role to bring this new content to Assassin's Creed Shadows. This includes a new free quest called "A Critical Encounter," a new Ally to recruit and a new trophy/achievement to add to your collection.</p><h4>New Free Story Pack: "A Critical Encounter"</h4><p>Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy. While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners.</p><p>Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.</p><p>Unlock conditions: Complete "Way of the Blacksmith" and unlock Yasuke as a playable character. This questline will start in the Hideout.</p><ul><li>Reward: New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li>New Trophy/Achievement: "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><p>With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke.</p><h4>New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h4><p>We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience.</p><p>Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:</p><ul><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.  <ul><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit--imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.  <ul><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries--only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h4>Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h4><p>We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too!</p><p>You will find the option available in the in-game settings.</p><ul><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h4>VFX Toggles</h4><p>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience.

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2, with this upgraded version of the original game set to release on October 10th. However, you can play it from today but there is a catch in that you have to pre-order Little Nightmares 3 to get access to it.&nbsp; The game will feature 60fps and 4K resolution. This is not the first we have heard of this release as it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-has-been-rated-for-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs/">rated for PS5, PC &amp; Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;</a>in 2023.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition will have 4K visuals, run at 60 fps and have updated visuals. You can see how it compares to the original in the trailer above. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares Review,</a> Tuffcub said, <em>“Little Nightmares is something of a minor classic. Gorgeously gross and surprisingly inventive, it creates a genuine feeling of terror and tension. It’s a bit odd to say a game that involves skipping over corpses is enjoyable, but it is, just don’t blame Tarsier if you have nightmares.”</em></p>
<p>This was not the final announcement from The Little Nightmares Showcase, as it as also been confirmed there is Little Nightmares VR project in development too. It is called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes, though no more information has been announced for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer SloClap makes their way back onto the pitch with the latest release, <em>Rematch</em>, which, for many, is a complete surprise given their previously released game, the critically acclaimed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4eb09aa-4d8d-496c-940f-2c14baf34294" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sifu-review" rel="nofollow">martial arts action game <em>Sifu</em></a>, and the online <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52c8a31d-3aae-4c41-8936-cf2702b2878d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/absolver-review-to-know-your-enemy-and-yourself" rel="nofollow">multiplayer combat game <em>Absolver</em></a>. As a keen football (soccer to my American counterparts) supporter for a specific English football club, the opportunity to review this game was right up my alley; having participated in May's Closed Beta Test, everything looked promising for <em>Rematch </em>and its developer.</p>

<p><em>Rematch </em>is premised largely inspired by a hybrid of street football and five-a-side football with no rules other than the Mercy Rule, meaning there are no yellow or red cards, no offside shenanigans, and no VAR required. But this game more than piqued my interest beyond making football games a cash cow project; it makes it fun to play and enjoy solo and with friends, as my hands-on experiences brought back childhood memories of playing <em>FIFA Street</em> with my younger brother.</p>

<h2><em>Rematch </em>Review - From The Academy To Football Stardom</h2>

<p>If you're in the loop about <em>Rematch</em>, it's an online multiplayer football game with a third-person perspective, which, for fans of <em>FIFA Street</em>, much like myself, this game feels like its spiritual successor. Unlike other prominent football games of yesteryear and the present time, players won't be going head-to-head against AI-controlled opponents, as every teammate and those on the opposing team are controlled by other players in the match.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-player-kicking-ball-at-goal.jpg?itok=gHT4jLH1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-player-kicking-ball-at-goal.jpg?itok=SOdiD6o2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every player on the pitch in 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, or Ranked matches is an actual person playing, no AI-controlled players. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>There are elements to yet another football-centric game, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c57d97b-9c9b-4a8b-ad82-932c8cf049c0" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>, where players are playing not just for ball possession but to pull off incredible goal-scoring moments worthy of being replayed, much to the pain and suffering of the team that conceded the goal. Another core gameplay aspect of Rematch is that it isn't a football-simulated game where players must strategize and assign their starting lineup and substitute players to keep the pressure on or bolster their defense; instead, what matters is the precise time to attack, tackle, steal ball possession, defend and of course, GOOOOOAL as one wrong button input or missed opportunity could spell the downfall of the match.</p>

<p>It may seem and feel this straightforward, but take it from me: there's a huge learning curve before immediately jumping into any of the multiplayer modes, and players can take advantage of the Practice mode, which unlocks once the Prologue is completed. Here, players can learn and practice various skills, like movement, passing, defending, scoring, and goalkeeping, through a tutorial to master the basics, with each skill having at least two Workshops for more advanced tricks.</p>

<p>The game's controls are pretty easy to learn and understand, but if you're like me, who spent time in Practice Mode, most of the advanced skills and controls get lost the moment they enter matchmaking, so sincerest apologies to those who had to carry me in matches during the Early Access period. Outside of the Prologue and Practice Modes, its core gameplay experiences are in its multiplayer features, of which <em>Rematch </em>offers Quick (Casual) and Ranked matches; the latter becomes available once players reach Level 5 in Quick (Casual) Match and only offers a Ranked 5v5 multiplayer mode.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quick (Casual) has three multiplayer modes: 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5, which are great options if playing solo, to help players master and fine-tune their fútbol skills and, of course, earn experience points (XP) to level up their ranking. There's a Custom Match feature, in which players can create private games and fine-tune the match parameters for their friends to join or join custom games from a generated code.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-skill-screen.jpg?itok=PgdjeyQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-skill-screen.jpg?itok=FEeNyv7U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each skill available in Practice Mode has a Tutorial to help players learn the basics and at least one Workshop course (or two) to master more advanced footballing skills. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Do keep in mind that experience (XP) will not be awarded to players when participating in custom games to earn XP; they can play in a Quick (Casual) or Ranked Match. Rematch also features Customization options for their in-game character, which include two Preset slots to customize their character and other customizable details, such as home and away kits, career profiles, Celebration emotes, ARs, and stadiums, among other features.</p>

<p>Some customization options, such as equipment options and kit designs, are locked behind the game's season pass, called the Captain Pass, or through microtransactions, in which they can buy more options within the Customization tab or the in-game Store. Speaking of the Captain Pass, Rematch looks to add new content every season for players to unlock on their free or premium tiers and new casual and competitive game features, the latter of which includes a tournament offering and leaderboard rankings for the professional players amongst us.</p>

<p>SloClap was initially scheduled to release crossplay support with the game at launch; however, due to ongoing technical issues, the developer has delayed its release to resolve pressing issues, including latency problems, desync, and stability issues, by releasing hotfixes and patch updates. With crossplay temporarily unavailable, players can matchmake in solo queue or create custom matches for friends on their preferred platform for the time being until the crossplay update launches soon.</p>

<h3><em>Rematch </em>Review - It Pays To Be A Football Star</h3>

<p>Rematch is similar to many live service sports games on the market, for which SloClap has developed and designed its content to appeal to all football fans. It doesn't have a central narrative that players can follow every season, although this would have been an interesting choice to pursue, further supported by the Prologue, which depicts our playable character's progression from an aspiring talent scouted to training for superstardom on the football pitch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-battle-pass-screen.jpg?itok=P2yhTwCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-battle-pass-screen.jpg?itok=IRpWHyuq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can earn various items, including cosmetics, stadiums, ARs and in-game currencies from the season pass by unlocking a tier and its corresponding slots using Tier Tokens. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of the live service offerings, Rematch has a season pass that has free-to-play (F2P) and paid tiers, and most of the unlocked rewards are cosmetics, but there are other cool rewards to get, such as stadiums, AR cages, Celebration and Victory emotes and more. There are three Chapters available within the pass, with the Pre-Season chapter currently available, and once completed, players can unlock the Qualifiers and the Championship chapters; however, the latter two will go live at specific dates and times during the current season.</p>

<p>Other rewards that can be unlocked from the free tiers of the season pass are the in-game currencies, Quants (the gold coins), and Blocks (blue credits). Both Quants and Blocks are used to purchase items from the in-game Store, and, in the case of the Quants, can also be used to purchase Upgrade Tickets and also purchase cosmetic items from the in-game Store.</p>

<p>Players can purchase Quants in bundles using real-world currency; however, Blocks can only be earned in-game from the pass and from completing matches. There are "technically" other currencies present in-game, the first being Tier Tokens, which are denoted with a green icon and are used to unlock season pass tiers, while the Upgrade Tickets are precisely what they're intended for: upgrading their season pass from free to premium (paid) version.</p>

<p><u><strong>I will admit</strong></u> that it took me around 15 hours to finally understand the Monetization model and the purposes of each in-game currency, which I wish the developer had added in-game pop-ups or labels to define them clearly. The <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/feature-focus-monetization" rel="nofollow">dedicated blog post on the game's Monetization model</a> adequately explains Quants and Blocks, but it doesn't do enough to explain how to earn and use Tier Tokens and Upgrade Tickets.</p>

<p>Despite the game's $30 price tag and a vast majority of the in-game content being accessible and available for free, the game has garnered some (and possibly valid) criticism aimed at its microtransactions, with <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/feature-focus-monetization" rel="nofollow">some players voicing their opinions online</a> on its cosmetic options locked behind the premium tiers. Yes, there are a few cosmetics to be unlocked on the free tiers; however, the remaining cosmetic items are paywalled, but if you want to own them, you will have to spend cold, hard cash to buy Quants before spending it, but this is an option at the end of the day.</p>

<h3><em>Rematch </em>Review - The Glitched And The Buggy</h3>

<p>For what SloClap offers players at launch with <em>Rematch</em>, there are a few areas that are missed shots during penalty shootouts. While I experienced minimal technical and performance issues during the Closed Beta Test (CBT), this differs from my experiences during the Early Access period, launch day, and post-launch period.</p>

<p>The developer has identified a handful of performance and stability issues, bugs, and glitches that impacted the gameplay experience during the game's Early Access period, which were addressed in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps" rel="nofollow">blog post regarding the game's launch</a> and post-launch plans. Two hotfix patches were released within this timeframe, and while they're aware that other issues are affecting players, <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-hotfixes-0-4-1-20-004" rel="nofollow">the Day 1 patch update</a> was released; however, some problems persist.</p>

<p>One of the significant issues is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2138720/discussions/0/594026463740585951/" rel="nofollow">ball desync</a>&nbsp;which has been a thorn in my side during Early Access, launch day, and post-launch, making multiple matches frustrating experiences to play at best. For those unfamiliar, this persistent issue occurs when the ball's current location, direction, or speed differs significantly for the player compared to others in the match due to desynchronization or inconsistency; which some noticeable ball desync behaviors I identified include the ball glitching and teleporting from multiple locations on the pitch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-ball-glitching.jpg?itok=V0E3-Xdg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-ball-glitching.jpg?itok=r_G8oHu7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What IS the ball doing??? (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another noticeable ball desync issue occurs when attempting to score, where multiple instances have been observed of trying to score, but the ball either doesn't move from its position. This can be particularly frustrating for goalkeeping positions as players would be unable to identify when the best opportunity to tackle opposing players and block incoming goal-scoring opportunities.</p>

<p>This is more prevalent when queuing up solo than when playing with friends, as the latter can still try to coordinate a different strategy, whereas playing solo, it will be almost impossible to coordinate or implement a strategy to mitigate the ball desync issue. Even more so for players, myself included, when attempting goals, which can lead to rather unfortunate mishaps or consequences like losing matches by a large margin or players leaving games out of frustration.</p>

<p>Ball desync remains an issue for the developer to patch, but matchmaking has been an equally stressful issue despite the availability of multiple servers at launch. During Rematch's Early Access period, the developers were aware of latency and desync issues that were impacting gameplay performance and server stability, which made matchmaking quite stressful.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the developer has <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936468880031105458" rel="nofollow">deployed multiple hotfixes and a patch update</a>, which aimed to address the aforementioned issues, especially concerning server and matchmaking issues; players, myself included, still experienced difficulties finding 4v4 and 5v5 matches across servers. As such, players have defaulted to 3v3 matches, and this has made finding these matches on the European server, from my perspective, somewhat annoying due to the long matchmaking times.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-player-celebration.jpg?itok=yUXFQ9UX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-player-celebration.jpg?itok=T7rr-DAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In light of recent hotfixes and patch updates, there have been improvements made to server stability and matchmaking, allowing players to find Casual and Ranked Matches much easier. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>But with the recent patch update adding fixes to improve server stability and matchmaking issues, I've been finding more 4v4 and 5v5 Casual matches, and the same can be said for Ranked 5v5 matches, despite being intimidated by the thought of playing in Ranked matches. Aside from the ongoing ball desync and various server and matchmaking issues, I did experience multiple game crashes, which may be related to the network and performance issues that the developer had released a fix for in a recent patch update; however, despite this, I still experienced game crashes, which were oftentimes during matches, meaning any XP accumulated and leveling progress was lost.</p>

<h2><em>Rematch </em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>SloClap's <em>Rematch </em>is the closest spiritual successor to <em>FIFA Street </em>we'll get, minus the scummy microtransactions and dubious content decisions we experienced from EA and the FIFA series. While the developer is working tirelessly to resolve the persistent technical and performance issues still plaguing the game, it delivers a fun and competitive football gaming experience that many have been seeking.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, I will continue to be a football fan, even during the worst years of my club’s performance, which has made it a lot harder to watch football. Based on my time with <em>Rematch</em>, sure, I suck rotten eggs, but I had a great time trying my best to up my in-game performance.</p>

<p>I guess I should spend my time away from the pitch in-game, at least.</p>

<p><em><strong>Rematch was reviewed on PC via Steam for 23 hours with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the course of the review.</strong></em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-overture-is-the-best-parts-of-the-game-executed-with-confidence.1227369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Lies of P</em> progresses, it moves away from the veiled story beats of its Souls game inspirations and veers closer to a direct melodrama. In these moments you can see something beautiful happen, not just a game finding its footing but a developer establishing a house style. The DLC, <em>Lies of P: Overture </em>takes this approach and hones it further, establishing the main game’s pattern as a clear-eyed approach to telling a story that goes beyond its simple premise.</p><p>For those who did not play the original <em>Lies of P</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should</a>. A take on the Pinocchio<em> </em>story in the style of <em>Bloodborne </em>and <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Lies of P </em>is one of the few titles to riff on what FromSoft established in a way that’s transformative and well-executed enough to be ranked as an equal. The main story takes place in the wake of societal collapse; the city of Krat is dominated by murderous puppets, mercenary humans known as stalkers, and people mutated into ambling creatures by a horrible petrification disease. As the game unfolds you begin to piece together how Krat fell, and who is to blame.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Overture</em> is chronologically a prequel, but mechanically one that involves P going back in time. It does not show Krat before its collapse; that part is still veiled, and I imagine would be far more complex than the scope of a DLC would allow. Rather, it shows the final days, following the events in the web of relationships that led to the creation of P. You follow the Legendary Stalker, a character whose importance is only alluded to in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The original <em>Lies of P </em>takes time to find its footing. <em>Overture </em>does not have that problem: those lessons have been learned already, and so when you play it you hit the ground running. This is true not just in how the narrative lays itself out, but also mechanically. <em>Overture</em> adds several new weapons, items, and legion arms, and thankfully none of them feel extraneous. The conceit of <em>Lies of P</em>’s weapon system is handles and blades that can be mixed and matched, but while the main game featured many weapons that felt like filler, <em>Overture </em>adds far fewer and makes the ones that it does include far more interesting.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The puppet has a gun. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>Most notable here is the Royal Horn Bow, which allows P to go medium range and totally changes combat. But there’s also a gunblade, a pair of Wolverine-style talons, and a lightning blade that all radically alter the flow of combat. The added legion arms, the trick weapons attached to P’s mechanical arm, are also welcome additions, and I spent the majority of <em>Overture</em> using the Cataclysm – a big shotgun that P can charge like Mega Man and, at higher levels, Active Reload like Gears of War. That’s right, they gave Pinocchio a shotgun.</p><figure><figcaption>They added a kitty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>If I went out of my way to find a major flaw in <em>Overture</em>, it is that it hews closely to the established patterns and tone of the main game. While it is clear that Krat has fallen and that the world is slightly less decrepit, it doesn’t take place far enough back chronologically to feel as distinct as it could. You are still fighting a lot of grotesque humans and animals, the latter of which are some of the most disgusting monsters I have ever fought in almost any game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things are nasty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>But practically speaking I’m not bothered. While <em>Overture </em>is more <em>Lies of P</em>, it’s more of the best part of <em>Lies of P.</em> A few of <em>Overture’s </em>locations rank among the most striking in the game, like the Zoo in the beginning, or a frozen shipwrecked area under a beautiful Aurora. There’s a side quest in it that hits harder than any in <em>Nier: Automata</em>. The bosses are tremendously challenging, and the final confrontation is both a fantastic reveal and a legendary fight. And when P finally does catch up with the Legendary Stalker, how the game chooses to fill in that backstory is a reveal that is heartbreaking and melodramatic in a way that could only come from these developers.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>There’s only so much you can efficiently do with DLC, particularly when it is abundantly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-first-dlc-and-game-update-teased" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear</a> that you are making a sequel. But <em>Overture</em> succeeds at its task of assuring the player that the success of the original game was no fluke.&nbsp; If <em>Lies of P </em>was developers Round 8 Studio and Neowiz announcing that they had arrived, <em>Overture </em>is a confirmation that they are here to stay.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 makes some big improvements over the first console, especially when comparing it to the first iteration that came out in 2017. A lot of that has to do with the significantly more powerful APU, but the larger, crisper screen is certainly the upgrade you'll notice first. It could also be the area where you might notice where the Switch 2 falls short of its predecessor.</p><p>Shortly after release, some discussions regarding how blurry the on-board display seemed to be started surfacing, prompting some hardware publications to take a closer look. Hardware Unboxed, known for detailed reviews of PC hardware and monitors, conducted a few tests on the Nintendo Switch 2 display, taking a closer look at the screen's response time. Running the display through 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure response times, Hardware Unboxed determined that the Switch 2's LCD was one of the slowest it's ever tested, coming in at 33.3ms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AB67B8LCorI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To put that into context, Hardware Unboxed compared this to an average LCD panel you'll find in entry-level displays today. These were tested in the same manner and averaged out to a response time of 6.3ms. Perhaps the most damning was the comparison to the original Switch's LCD, a display that is more than eight years old, that presented a response time nearly twice as fast a 21.3ms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noted the same issues with the display in its extensive Nintendo Switch 2 review earlier this week, noting that, "The Switch 2 LCD has blurring characteristics that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch's display"</p><p>Why does a fast response time matter? With slower response times, it takes longer for the image on-screen to transition between new frames, which can lead to noticeable blurring with objects in motion. This is particularly bad when the Switch 2 is running games at 60fps, which thus far is the preferred frame rate of most first-party titles. To put it into perspective, it takes 16.67ms for a new frame to be rendered when running at 60Hz, but it takes the display twice as long to transition from one frame to the next, causing a significant bottleneck that reduces the impact of improved motion clarity that higher refresh rates provide. This would be just as bad, if not worse, in games making use of the full 120Hz the new display has to offer.</p><p>It's unclear why this is happening, but Hardware Unboxed offers a suggestion that Nintendo has decided to reduce an overdrive support for the display (which uses higher voltages to drive faster transitions) in the pursuit of better battery life. With a display that is brighter and larger, Nintendo might have potentially reduced its ability to transition faster as a tradeoff. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 ships with a 19Wh battery, less than half of that found in Valve's Steam Deck, it's understandable why this concession might have been made. But considering how noticeable it can be once you've seen it, it could make portable play significantly less desirable until addressed, if it ever is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-qa-its-a-very-good-match-for-us-because-of-the-stories-we-want-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Alexander Mishulin and Andrey Tsvetkov from Owlcat Games about The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, which was announced earlier this month during Summer Game Fest 2025. During our conversation, we noted that this was a very different game from what Owlcat has made so far (Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, all of which are cRPGs). Interestingly, we learned that the studio has hired experts in third-person action RPG games, including some from CD Projekt RED:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin</strong>: It was part of the process when we were in pre-production. We had to establish different processes. It's not difficult or something very special or an unusual transition; it's just a new process to make a new game. Also, we expanded our team for this project. We welcomed new team members from companies that have already done similar games, especially from CD Projekt, so we built not only upon our own expertise and knowledge but also upon our new colleagues' knowledge, which helped us quite a lot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the choice to go with third-person, Owlcat added:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mishulin: </strong>From the first pitch, it was all about making a third person game because The Expanse is about people. We want you to connect more with the characters, the protagonist and the companions, and we want you to be immersed in this very grounded, realistic, sci-fi world.</em></p>
<p><em>We wanted to show you that, and for that, we needed to change perspective and make things more realistic and cinematic. Because of that, we transitioned to the third person, and yes, we were a little bit afraid at the beginning. We started prototyping and made several combat and exploration arenas.&nbsp;We experimented with different approaches, how we wanted our cover system to work, how we wanted our enemies to work. Just for combat arenas, we had six prototypes in the beginning just to make the combat basics feel right.</em></p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn doesn't have a release date yet, but we look forward to learning more about it in the coming months. Stay tuned for more coverage on Wccftech.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve been enjoying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091183/netflix-games-hades-release-date-ios-march"><em>Hades</em> on mobile via Netflix</a>, you better get in those last few runs while you still can. First spotted by Engadget, and confirmed via the Netflix app, Supergiant’s Greek mythology inspired roguelike and 21 other games are being delisted from the service next month. Several titles like <em>Braid</em>, <em>Katana Zero</em>, and yes, <em>Hades</em>, were available exclusively on mobile via Netflix, meaning that when those games go, that’s potentially it for them on Android / iOS.</p><p>Here’s a full list of the games leaving Netflix next month. Most games depart the service July 14th, but <em>Hades </em>goes a little earlier on July 1st. (<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, however, doesn’t have a confirmed date for delisting, only that it’s “leaving soon.”)</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Battleship </em></span></li><li><span><em>Braid, Anniversary Edition </em></span></li><li><span><em>Carmen Sandiego </em></span></li><li><span><em>CoComelon: Play with JJ</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Death’s Door</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Dumb Ways to Survive</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Ghost Detective</em></span></li><li><span><em>Hades </em></span></li><li><span><em>Katana ZERO</em></span></li><li><span><em>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</em></span></li><li><span><em>Ludo King</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley 2</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley 3</em></span></li><li><span><em>Rainbow Six: Smol</em></span></li><li><span><em>Raji: An Ancient Epic</em></span></li><li><span><em>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</em></span></li><li><span><em>TED Tumblewords</em></span></li><li><span><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></span></li><li><span><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></span></li><li><span><em>Vineyard Valley</em></span></li></ul></div><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to the developers of the games that had their mobile versions available exclusively via Netflix to ask if they had plans to distribute them as premium titles. In an email, Nigel Lowrie, a spokesperson for Devolver Digital, wrote, “We are looking at bringing games that leave services like <em>Poinpy</em>, <em>Katana Zero</em>, and <em>Death’s Door</em> to mobile stores as premium titles.” </p><p>He also said that the developer for each of these games has its own timeline for when that will happen but Devolver is working to get them up on mobile storefronts “as soon as possible.” Devolver Digital has some experience with this as <em>Exit the Gungeon</em>, which had a mobile version available exclusively via Apple Arcade, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/689374/enter-the-mobile-gungeon">will become a paid game on iOS and Android</a> after it was delisted from Apple’s gaming subscription service last year.</p><p>In the Discord server for Color Gray Games, the developers of the <em>Golden Idol </em>series, Andrejs Klavins, the games’ lead designer and programmer, wrote, “This is all recent news for us and all the practical implications have yet to be worked out.” The statement suggests that some developers were only recently told their games would be leaving the platform and not something that was necessarily pre-planned.</p><div><p>This removal of third-party games, many of which had decent, mainstream success outside of Netflix, reflects the platform’s shifting games strategy. It has halted its acquisition spree and, in October of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix closed the new studio it spun up to produce a multiplatform AAA game</a> before it could release anything. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">In an interview with <em>The Verge</em> at the Game Developers Conference in March</a>, Netflix’s new president of games Alain Tascan said, “we need to find our voice.” </p></div><p>Netflix plans on streamlining its offerings to focus more on games that are tied to Netflix-owned shows, multiplayer party games, games for kids, and “mainstream” titles that have their own large fanbases. And when you look at the numbers, that strategy makes sense.</p><p>According to data from Appfigures, a mobile analytics company, the most popular game on Netflix is – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">coming at no surprise</a> – <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> with an estimated 37 million downloads. The next most popular, though it has less than half the downloads of <em>San Andreas</em>, is <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, a tie-in game for the Netflix-produced Korean social thriller <em>Squid Game</em>. Those two games aren’t going anywhere for now. But if you’re a fan of any of the games above, they will be leaving soon so try them while you can.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I'm not entirely sure of the cultural relevancy of Chicken Run, even if it did get one of those trendy legacy sequels back in 2023, and yet here we are with the reveal of an entire video game. The name of said game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chicken-run-eggstraction">Chicken Run: Eggstraction</a>, and quite fittingly it is an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, one that might even look quite good? 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It certainly matches the look of the films for starters, though that's not much of a surprise given that Aardman themselves are making it, with Outright Games on publishing duties. It seems that Aardman have also made some new bits of stop-motion animation just for the game too, and it looks as good as it always does, to no one's surprise.

<p>
The game is also a sequel to that aforementioned legacy sequel, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with Frizzle taking the lead this time. Josie Sedgwick-Davies is back as Frizzle, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>' Bella Ramsey returning as Molly (the chick of the original film's protagonists Ginger and Rocky) too.
</p>
<p>
How about gameplay? Well, this time around you'll be setting out to rescue chickens from the nugget industry, so missions see you embarking with different characters from the movies all with their own abilities. Levels see you having to do classic stealth game things like avoiding security cameras by hiding in traffic cones, and solving puzzles and the like. You'll also have to guide the chickens you're rescuing Pikmin style throughout the levels, so it's just as much about infiltration as it is exfiltration (or eggsfiltration, I suppose). Oh, and you can play it in co-op too!
</p>
<p>
I quite like the idea of something vaguely like Pikmin meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> meets XCOM (specifically the squad forming bit), it just looks like a silly good time. A light bit of Untitled Goose Game energy about it too. No exact release date for it just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419690/Chicken_Run_Eggstraction/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

Part of a $60 bundle that includes an open face dock so fans can play in TV mode without removing the case (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is also having some issues</a></span>), the main culprit are the plastic grips that hug the new Joy-Con. As Dbrand itself has explained following all of the customer complaints, there’s a small lip on the inside edge of the Joy-Con case that’s meant to keep it from easily sliding out. But that lip also fills in an air gap engineered into the Switch 2 between the screen and the Joy-Con to help with the magnetic locking mechanism.</p><p>Dbrand sent me the Killswitch case at launch and I’ve been testing it along with a bunch of other accessories. When I started to wonder why I never encountered this issue before, I realized it’s because I didn’t have my Joy-Con fully in their cases so the lip was never filling that air gap. The result was that the Joy-Con never popped out while I was holding the console. Instead, the problem I encountered was that the Joy-Con cases easily popped off if I moved my hands laterally at all. </p><p>Dbrand actually brings up that exact problem <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a long Reddit</a></span> post on June 22 defending the Killswitch case for the Switch 2. It mentions the sliding issue with a “different brand’s NS2 case,” which in this case is Genki’s Attack Vector.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I’ve been testing that kit as well and have had that precise issue. So it’s a design challenge that’s not unique to Dbrand, but it’s also clear from the issues people are experiencing that it’s one Dbrand hasn’t adequately solved either yet.</p><p>After making sure my Joy-Con were firmly locked into my Killswitch case, I did some testing today and sure enough the Joy-Con kept popping out, leaving the rest of the console to plunge to its doom. Dbrand claims, in its defense, that this is only an issue for people holding their Switch 2 wrong. The company claims all three of the following criteria need to be met for the Killswitch case to fail:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></li><li>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></li><li>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The notoriously irreverent and abrasive accessory maker then went on to blame customers for user error, stating “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” That set off a fresh firestorm in the subreddit of people showing that many have in fact held the Switch 2 like that, including YouTuber LinusTechTips and <em>Tonight Show</em> host Jimmy Fallon. Also my oldest kid, who walks into my home office flapping the Switch 2 by the Joy-Con with one hand  at least three times a week despite my constant threats to never let him play it again if he doesn’t stop.</p><p>Dbrand maintains that only a small number of the over 100,000 Killswitch cases it’s manufactured are exhibiting real problems. Its position is that while people who want to make their Switch 2 fall off while using the case can, most won’t experience that under normal usage. For those that do, Dbrand is changing the variance in size of the Joy-Con case lip to filter out overly big ones during the manufacturing process starting with July shipments. “For those that have received their order and are having issues that they believe fall within ‘regular use,’ we’re fucking sorry,” Dbrand wrote on Reddit. While the explanation makes sense, the tone and lack of accountability do not. <br></p><p>“People bought a case to protect damage for their expensive product but also expected to use it as the original console design intended, and there’s a point where [you] need to drop the act and start acting like adults, not children behind a keyboard,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one person in response. “To see the company not only blame the consumer, but also refuse to retool their clearly defective product, and then have the gall to ask dissatisfied customers to not use the product and pay expensive return shipping rates to a completely different country in order to get a refund, erodes the trust Dbrand has gained from its community,” wrote another.</p><p>Implying that at least some of the people who bought the Killswitch case and then posted videos of the Joy-Con popping out on Reddit were disingenuous clout chasers was a bold strategy that doesn’t yet appear to be paying off. It’s easy to see the obstacles on Dbrand’s end. The Switch 2's magnetic connectors are a bespoke and precisely engineered solution to a design challenge by a different company. Designing around that is not easy task, especially if you’re racing to manufacture inventory for launch in the middle of a chaotic trade war without early access to the actual hardware in question. </p><p>But after testing the Killswitch off and on for a couple of weeks, I’m not convinced that it’s any more deserving of special considerations than other accessories, especially cheaper ones on offer from any number of generic copycat shops. The Killswitch doesn’t feel so good or so premium that it’s worth overlooking a key vulnerability. The rail locks for the Joy-Con on my older Switch OLED were treated so roughly over the years that one of the tiny screws fell out without me even noticing and it jiggles now. So for now I’d hold off on the Killswitch until the air-gap problem is fixed across the board. </p><p>What I can recommend is Dbrand’s screen protector. It’s hands-down the best on the market thanks to a specialty case that makes applying it perfectly with no bubbles or botched angles completely dummy proof. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dbrand-killswitch-case-joy-con-magnets-instock-1851785019]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Final Fantasy Universes Beyond crossover</a> is already proving to be a massive hit. After breaking preorder records, the set is now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">flying off shelves and selling out everywhere</a>, with collectors and Commander fans alike scrambling to pick up iconic characters in card form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're opening boosters, sorting through prerelease pulls, or keeping tabs on the market for trade value, it's clear this set is drawing serious attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're curious which cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today">in highest demand right now</a>, either to cash in or just to see what the hype is all about, we've broken down the top 12 best-selling Final Fantasy cards based on data from trusted marketplace TCGPlayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve simplified the list for clarity, grouping some variants, like Borderless and Surge Foils, with their base versions, while also noting the specific card number that’s proving most popular (i.e, Aerith Gainsborough - 519). Not every slot is a Mythic Rare either. This list includes a bit of variety to reflect what’s actually trending, while still focusing on the standout cards from the set. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Aerith Gainsborough - 519</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEggxX?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aerith Gainsborough</a> is a deceptively powerful engine for life gain and +1/+1 counter strategies. With lifelink built in, she can start growing immediately,every time you gain life, Aerith picks up a +1/+1 counter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And when she dies, she passes that strength on, putting <em>X</em> +1/+1 counters on each legendary creature you control, where <em>X</em> is the number of counters she had. In the right deck, that can be a game-ending swing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card’s popularity is reflected in its pricing. The standard print is just $1.83, while the foil version goes for $16.81. For collectors or premium deckbuilders, the borderless version is around $39, but the rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEggxX?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>borderless surge foil</strong> sits at a much steeper $140+</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Starting Town - 289</h2><div id="223183" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Starting Town - 289</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting Town is an early-game powerhouse, especially in multicolor decks. If you can play it on turn one, two, or three, it enters untapped, giving you immediate access to mana without slowing your tempo. Beyond that, it taps for colorless, or you can pay 1 life to generate one mana of any color, making it a flexible piece in almost any deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That versatility comes at a price. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW4VZ?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regular version is currently going for around $14</a>, while the foil will set you back just under $17. Still, for decks that care about fast, reliable mana across multiple colors, it's proving to be well worth the cost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Summon: Knights of Round - 359</h2><div id="223175" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Knights of Round - 359 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summon: Knights of the Round</a> is one of the hottest cards from the Final Fantasy crossover right now, and it’s not hard to see why. For just five mana, you create three 2/2 white Knight creature tokens, instantly building a board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it gets even better with its [V] ability, Ultimate End, which gives all your other creatures +2/+2 until end of turn and puts an indestructible counter on each of them. Combined with the card’s own indestructible keyword, it turns even a modest board into a nearly unstoppable force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version is currently going for $35.99</a>, which marks a 25% drop in market price this month. The standard print is more budget-friendly at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb8K1?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$21.88</a>. Either way, it’s a powerful pickup for Knight, token, or white-based Commander decks, and one that’s likely to remain popular.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Traveling Chocobo - 210</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase card of all chase cards, there are just 77 gold foil Traveling Chocobos out there, available. There are other versions, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/z622ER?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neon Ink versions going for well over $1000</a>, but if you manage to find the gold foil, it is <em><strong>the one</strong></em> you’ll want to find when you’re cracking open <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q477Xd?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering how much the ink versions are <em>already</em> going for, I can't imagine how much the Gold Foil variant would actually be valued at, maybe you just win at money and never have to pay for Magic cards again, now that would be nice. But, that being said, one did recently sell for <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/golden-chocobo-40k-sale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around $30K on eBay</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Summon: Bahamut - 1</h2><div id="223174" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Bahamut - 356 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love a big ol’ dragon in my Magic collection, and Bahamut certainly fits that bill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only does this Summon create a 9/9, but it can remove permanents, trigger card draw, and use Mega Flare to essentially finish a game of Commander. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All yours for around $93 in the borderless variant, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg8rq?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">around $30 for the standard print</a> right now at TCGPlayer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Lightning, Army of One - 545</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">How many card variants do you NEED? Apparently, Final Fantasy 13’s protagonist, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48Ab?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning</a>, needs at least five. To be fair, that makes sense considering how many spin off games she got. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Army of One is all about the Stagger mechanic, teeing your foes up for double damage while also offering lifelink, first strike, and trample in a three-cost card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Market price is already up to around $256.50 for the most popular <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xx6W?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderless Surge Foil</a> version, while my personal favorite is seemingly the cheapest (but still just as popular), <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7B4g?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">normal print for $20.58</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Yuna, Hope of Spira - 549</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yuna's an interesting one, as it's just her <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OOo8?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">549 Borderless Surge Foil</a> that have drawn the <em>most </em>interest from eager buyers in the secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, her <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVX5wN?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standard variant</a> is also going through much more of geniune surge in value over the past couple of weeks, rising +143.65% in value, jumping from a low of $5.68 to around $20.15 most recently. It's a big jump in such a short space of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Tifa Lockhart - 536</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8ob?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tifa Lockhart</a> continues to be a main stay of the best selling Final Fantasy cards, and even featured as one of the most popular during the presale period just before the Universes Beyond set launched. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tifa has a Landfall trigger that doubles her power alongside her existing Trample keyword. As TCGPlayer points out, you can grow her attack power with something like Titanic Growth and then use Fabled Passage to double it again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’ll set you back between <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4755k?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$9.10 for the standard version</a>, and all the way up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j30q?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$187.60 for the Borderless Surge Foil</a> variant. Otherwise, and quite surprisingly, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObjjO?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">non-foil Borderless version</a> is pretty good value for money at around $25.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Buster Sword - 255</h2><div id="223171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword - 351 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s Cloud without the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1A1P?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buster Sword</a>? Thankfully, this iconic weapon gets the treatment it deserves in Magic’s Final Fantasy set, with a stunning borderless version illustrated by Karuta Shiki. It’s more than just a collector’s piece too, it’s a powerful piece of equipment in its own right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buster Sword gives the equipped creature +3/+2, making it a serious threat in combat. But the real payoff comes when that creature connects with a player. Not only do you draw a card, but you can immediately cast a spell from your hand with mana value equal to or less than the damage dealt, without paying its cost. </p><div id="223177" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword - 255</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a card this flashy doesn’t come cheap. While current listings on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwJw6?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer hover around $66</a> for the standard issue, it has already sold for as much as <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1A1P?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$208.30 this month for its fantastic borderless version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a fan of Cloud or just love flashy, high-impact equipment, this is one to watch, and anything under triple digits is looking like a bargain right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Vivi Ornitier - 248</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 9 spellcaster <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW44O?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a>, by Toshiyuki Itahana (character designer on the game), might just be one of the best cards in the game right now. So, it's hardly surprising that it's standard card is up there as the third most popular in the set currently. Market price isn't too bad either (at least compared to the rest of this list), if you're looking to buy one standalone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version is also the absolute definition of a collector’s item if I've ever seen one, and proving to have plenty of interest as well. Both of these can also be considered a top 10 card for collectors, also demanding a rather mighty price at around <a href="https://zdcs.link/av484E?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$72.13 for the former</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ3J2?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$232.71 for the later</a> in the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Cloud, Midgar Mercenary - 520</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ342?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is, unsurprisingly, by far one of the most popular cards from the Final Fantasy x MTG Universes Beyond set. Low mana cost and double equipment triggers make Cloud very close to Stoneforge Mystic, but with some striking new anime art from Kazto Furuya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ342?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderless Surge Foil</a> variant one of the priciest cards from the new set (sitting at around $466 market), the Borderless, Extended Art, and Normal print all also fetch a pretty penny right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of popularity, the Borderless Surge Foil is shoulders above the rest, but the Normal print is also exceedingly popular right now according to TCGPlayer, and still one of the top 20 cards players have been chasing since the new set released. Finding any of these, or deciding to buy them out right standalone, are good reasons to get excited. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier - 527</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8bw?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier - 0527 (Borderless) (Surge Foil)</a> is the most popular card in the game right now, and has surged to a market price of $701.55 this week, up +74.09% just this month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's not the only version that's proving popular either, with the 382 and 317 Borderless, alongside the 115 Normal print also proving to increasingly sought after right now, which is unsurprisingly reflected in the market prices right now as well. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Cards</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/where-to-buy-mtg-final-fantasy-ign-new-update-1750332391774.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to give it to you straight right from the off. It's painfully hard to get hold of any of these sets from major retailers right now. While we saw some big restocks over the past month, pretty much everywhere is sold out of Final Fantasy MTG at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can provide some handy links to bookmark so you can check back in, but for now, your best chance of securing <em>anything </em>will be via the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a033mN?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most trusted third-party resellers like TCGPlayer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, collectors will instead be most interested in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair"><u>new Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</u></a>, instead. It’s been a busy year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Wizards of the Coast’s limited-time mini-sets</a>, and while the company sold out of all three Final Fantasy drops in record time (leaving many disappointed), you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still get them via third-party sellers</a>... if you're willing to pay the inflated costs, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a trio of Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets, Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over, each offering unique art and names for Magic: The Gathering cards. Everything is available in standard and foil, alongside the Japanese variants as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, since they've sold out, you won’t find Secret Lair drops at the same price as you’d find them directly from Wizards of the Coast (<strong>standard $30 nonfoil, $40 rainbow foil</strong>), with most being listed anywhere between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80-$150 or above</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a huge markup, so if you're looking to buy, be sure you're 100% informed of what you're paying for.

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>'s main endgame activities, Nightmare dungeons, will be permanently changed come Season 9, as Blizzard looks to make them both more challenging and surprising going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a new <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215863/purge-the-sins-of-the-horadrim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, when Season 9 launches July 1, Nightmare dungeons will receive some major updates. Most notably, there will be a new activity within them called Horadric Strongrooms. Described as a "potent micro-dungeon," strongrooms will be found more frequently on higher Torment difficulties and can also be reliably found by using a Nightmare dungeon sigil that guarantees the appearance of a strongroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players are inside the dungeon, players can discover a portal that will take them to the strongroom. In a system somewhat similar to Diablo 4's Infernal Hordes activity, players will be able to select from a number of statues that add modifiers to the strongroom, increasing the challenge but also the rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W5UkhQVtMQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6W5UkhQVtMQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will then need to attune themselves with the strongroom by slaying enemies within the vicinity of Horadric Pillars within a time limit. Those who complete the attunement process will be transported to the micro-dungeon's final boss that when defeated will reward a Grand Horadric cache that scales its rewards based on the amount of attunement players earned. These caches will include Obducite as a reward, an endgame material needed to Masterwork weapons and armor. Completing the strongroom will also grant a buff that lasts for the remainder of the Nightmare dungeon, which a chance to receive more XP from monsters, increased reputation gains, increased Obducite drops, 25% more gold, or Horadric Phial drops (a seasonal item that is used to make Horadric Jewels).</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be another new way to experience Nightmare dungeons--Escalating Nightmares. This new endgame activity is a sequence of three Nightmare dungeons that see dungeon affixes stack from one to the next, with monster difficulty additionally increasing for each subsequent dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">To access an Escalating Nightmare, players will need to find Escalation Sigils from completing Horadric Strongrooms. In pre-Torment difficulties, completing all three dungeons will finish the Escalating Nightmare. However, those playing on Torment difficulties will instead be transported to a boss fight, where players will take on a new version of Astaroth from the Diablo 4 main campaign. Players will need to defeat both Astaroth and his steed, which will become separate bosses over the course of the fight. Defeating Astaroth's mount first will see it go into a resurrection state, after which it will rejoin the fight if players can't defeat Astaroth in time. Astaroth can also be modified by Nightmare dungeon affixes, making the boss fight even more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164"></a><figcaption>A look at everything coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Nightmare dungeons will receive new affixes.

                <p>A decade after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light/" data-ref-id="5000-182057">Dying Light</a> came out in 2015, developer Techland is revisiting the zombie game with a major new update to refresh the game's visuals and other elements--just don't call it a remaster.</p><p><a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The "Retouched" update</a>, as it's called, launches on June 26. This update is focused on "squeezing out even more" from Dying Light, the studio said. "It's not a complete overhaul or remaster," the developer clarified, adding that the team has found new ways to "squeeze more from the tech we already have."</p><p>"One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets--and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game," technical game director Grzegorz Świstowski said.</p><p>In the Retouched update, players can expect increased texture quality and upscaling for textures to help them look "sharper" and better overall.</p><p>Additionally, the "maximum level of detail range" in Dying Light has been increased from 260% to 340% in the view distance menu from the game's settings. The studio is also adding new "8K Ultra shadow quality" and improved lighting for many surfaces. Surfaces that might have previously looked "flat" should not "really pop out and get depth."</p><p>Check out some of the images in the gallery below to see the improvements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148" data-ratio="0.55555555555556" data-width="738" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148"></a><figcaption>The wood now looks more like wood.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520149,1300-4520150" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond visuals, Techland said composer Paweł Blaszczak came back to "give the soundtrack a complete remaster" with a unique twist.</p><p>"He even recreated that retro-tape sound by actually recording on tape! Talk about dedication. It’s authentic, nostalgic, and absolutely fantastic," Techland said, adding that the Retouched update will have new tracks and ambient sounds. Audio in combat has been "juiced up," too.</p><p>"Every swing, every crunch, every zombie takedown will sound more satisfying, more impactful. You'll feel those hits," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abQYwONaKgk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/abQYwONaKgk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This Retouched update was first hinted at in January, and Techland said it took so long to realize because of the manual effort required.</p><p>"I basically walked through the entire map, looking for assets to be improved. And all of those had to be changed manually by our artists," lead 3D artist Krzysztof Knefel said.</p><p>The Retouched update doesn't require players to invest in new PC hardware, however, as Techland said it was important to keep the system requirements the same. The Retouched update is also available on PS4 and Xbox One, requiring Techland to test the game "endlessly" to ensure "we didn't run out of memory" for those older consoles.</p><p>The Retouched patch launches June 26 and it's free for everyone across PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Retouched update promises improvements on all systems, Techland said, "the level of changes may vary by platform," but it didn't dig into specifics.</p><p>June 26 is also the date that CD Projekt Red planned to release Cyberpunk 2077's big new 2.3 update, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620">it's been delayed</a>. Techland and CD Projekt are two of Poland's biggest developers, and fans of their games no longer have to decide what to play first on June 26.</p><p>Dying Light was followed up by 2022's Dying Light 2. The next entry in the series is Dying Light: The Beast, which launches in August for console and PC.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, you're able to select one of four classes for your character, with another being available later on in the game. Your class determines the ability trees you have access to, your stats, and certain playstyles that mesh better with specific classes. While you can make any class into what you want, it's most beneficial to choose a class that you can scale properly and efficiently as you advance in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>There are some classes that are best for beginners, but these classes won't benefit most players in the long run. If you're just looking for the best overall classes in Dune: Awakening, then you can check out the guide below to see a full class tier list and explanations for why each class is ranked where it is.</p><h2>Dune: Awakening class tier list</h2><p>One of the most important aspects of the class system to remember is that you're not locked to your class's ability trees for the entire game. You can eventually interact with "trainers" in Dune: Awakening that allow you to unlock other classes' ability trees, giving you the chance to create a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-best-starting-class-and-build/1100-6532573/" data-ref-id="1100-6532573">build </a>entirely or add some abilities you previously didn't have access to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517702" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517702"></a><figcaption>Selecting a starting class in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png"></figure><p>However, not all trainers are accessible at the same time in Dune: Awakening. You can find some trainers early on in your journey, while others can't be found until much later. So, if you're looking for the optimal class route, you want to select a class that has a late-game trainer unlock, as this gives you that class's ability trees right away.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't always apply when it comes to picking a class, as one or two classes in Dune: Awakening are strong enough on their own that they don't necessarily need abilities from other trees.</p><p>With all of that in mind, here's our current class tier list for Dune: Awakening:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Tier</th><th scope="col">Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Mentat, Planetologist</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Trooper</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Naturally, there is quite a lot of room for debate with this tier list, as the classes in Dune: Awakening are all varied and can appeal to different players. However, we have a few concrete reasons for our rankings, which we'll outline below.</p><h3>S Tier</h3><p>In S tier, we have Swordmaster and Bene Gesserit. Starting with Swordmaster, this is arguably the best class in all of Dune: Awakening, regardless of your skill level, experience, etc.</p><p>Swordmaster begins with the Knee Charge ability, which can absolutely shred through enemies at close range in the early game and maintains its value in the late game as well. Knee Charge makes going through camps and other enemy spots an absolute breeze, allowing you to save ammunition and healing items when they're most crucial to have.</p><p>As for Bene Gesserit, this is one class you'll want to use if you're an experienced survival player or you've gone through Dune: Awakening a time or two already. The Bene Gesserit begins with the Voice: Compel ability, and the class emphasizes a psychological approach to combat rather than a physical one. This can make the early game a bit challenging, as you need to utilize your wits and avoid relying on abilities for every situation. However, if you can master the Bene Gesserit class, it's incredibly powerful as you progress.</p><h3>A Tier</h3><p>Moving on to the A tier, we have selected Mentat and Planetologist. The Mentat class could make an argument for the S tier, while Planetologist is just an all-around solid class that's good, not great,t for the duration of Dune: Awakening.</p><p>Mentat begins with The Sentinel ability, which is a terrific way to fight enemies without your character having to do much. The ability places a turret down and allows you to deal damage and get out of sticky situations with ease. One of the more intriguing parts of the Mentat, though, is its access to poison damage, which scales particularly well with ranged weapons.</p><p>As for the Planetologist, this technically isn't a starting class, but it's still a class you can unlock as you approach the late game. The Planetologist is arguably the best late-game class, but it's only in A tier, seeing as you can't use it for a majority of your playthrough. The class excels at base building, resource management, and other survival aspects of the game. It's seen as a utility class that doesn't have a major focus on combat, but you'll still have loads of combat abilities to access in the late game in addition to your new abilities from the Planetologist's trees.</p><h3>B Tier</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517701"></a><figcaption>The opening ability tree for the Trooper in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png"></figure><p>Finally, in the B tier is the Trooper. This ranking is slightly unfair, as the Trooper is actually a highly enjoyable class with a ton of use, especially in the early game. The only reason we put it in B tier is because you can access the Trooper's trainer early on in Dune: Awakening, allowing you to access its ability trees. So, you can essentially get the best of both worlds if you select another class at the start.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Trooper has some of the best mobility out of any class in Dune: Awakening, primarily thanks to its starting Shigawire Claw ability that acts as a grappling hook. The Trooper also has some terrific early combat abilities, making it a solid beginner class as well as a decent class for all skill levels.</p><p>And that wraps up our class tier list for Dune: Awakening. Of course, as time goes on, developer Funcom might make some updates to the classes and even add new ones, so this tier list may change over time. </p>

It’s a money-making machine for the right type of playstyle—specifically a thief or pirate-type—and with the appropriate upgrades, it even features a bonafide Fence, Spymaster, and a personal Fletcher for you stealth archer types out there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-selling-stolen-goods-scaling-gates-1851781929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-selling-stolen-goods-scaling-gates-1851781929">Three Essential Things <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> Doesn’t Tell You</a></span></p><p>For now, let’s focus on finding the player house.<strong> It’s located southeast of Anvil.

The cave icon is on the wrong hill. <strong>If you follow the in-game map precisely, you’ll wind up in the wrong location.</strong> Instead, head to said location, then turn back toward the Anvil castle to the north. You’ll note a little cove between the castle and a rocky outcropping.

                <p>Few games pack the technical punch of Cyberpunk 2077, making it an interesting proposition for Nintendo's shiny new handheld. While the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade to the original, Cyberpunk 2077 is considered one of the most hardware-intensive games in recent years. Despite this, CD Projekt Red's ambitious Switch 2 port is a commendable one that makes the most of the console's power, but with some noticeable drawbacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 for the Switch 2 offers a performance mode and quality mode for both docked and handheld play, with the key difference between the two play styles being resolution. While docked, Cyberpunk 2077's resolution ranges between 540p and 1080p. In quality mode, it shouldn't fall below 720p. Handheld play, depending on the graphics mode, scales between 360p and 810p. This sounds rough, but given the screen size and DLSS, Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty palatable on the Nintendo Switch 2. Post-processing effects help offset this low resolution and the Switch 2 screen boasts a clean image, especially at a standstill. The quality can vary depending on what's happening on screen, though. If you're speeding through Night City or in the heat of combat, the resolution may plummet, but most players probably won't be able to tell.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143"></a><figcaption>Johnny Silverhand looking at V with Night City in the background captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quality mode targets 30 frames per second and performance mode targets 40. The caveat is that performance mode while docked only works with 120Hz TVs and monitors, meaning that not every display can utilize the frame rate boost. However, in my testing, the frame rate boost seemed pretty negligible when compared to quality mode. This is largely due to the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 does not support variable refresh rate while docked, meaning the frame rate dips are noticeable. Fortunately, the quality setting appears to be more consistent. The frame rate can fluctuate depending on where you are in the world and what's happening. Thanks to the Switch 2's built-in VRR screen, performance mode feels pretty solid while playing handheld. That said, Dog Town--the new district added in the Phantom Liberty DLC--appears to be particularly taxing on the Switch 2. It's far from unplayable, but it does run slightly worse than other parts of the city. This shouldn't come as a surprise considering Phantom Liberty never made it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One due to technical limitations. That makes its inclusion on the Switch 2 all the more noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2, the visuals have noticeably been pared back. While it doesn't feel as extreme of a downgrade as The Witcher 3's 2019 Switch port, those who played Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-end PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5 will definitely see the difference. Draw distances are reined in, textures aren't as detailed, and the lighting isn't as crisp. That said, it does appear to outpace last-gen consoles--perhaps not in every way, but I'd much rather play Cyberpunk 2077 on my Switch 2 than my creaky old Xbox One. For me, the most notable differences are the smaller crowd sizes and emptier roads. At times, especially in the downtown areas, Night City feels a bit empty. Concessions had to be made, and I understand why this was chief among them, but wandering around a quiet city center can take me out of the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144"></a><figcaption>The hacking menu on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a straightforward port to the Nintendo Switch 2. CD Projekt Red has leveraged the console's hardware to add in some new ways to play. The most interesting of the bunch are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">mouse controls</a>. This lets you use a Joy-Con as a mouse in order to aim, and it works well. Once I tweaked the sensitivity, I had no trouble lining up headshots and gunning down enemies from afar. It's a little awkward maneuvering with mouse controls outside of combat, and the default button layout took some getting used to, but it feels like more than just a gimmick. I could see myself playing for dozens of hours with mouse controls turned on. However, the gyro controls <em>do</em> feel like a gimmick. Using a Pro Controller or Joy-Con, you can aim using motion; it's not quite as imprecise as it sounds, but it's certainly not the ideal way to play Cyberpunk 2077. The more approachable, middle ground is to use the gyro controls for subtle adjustments while aiming. You can control your camera with the right stick, but when you need to make a slight adjustment you can use the motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, CD Projekt Red has added touch controls to the experience. This primarily lets you navigate menus with your finger. As someone who has put in over 250 hours into Cyberpunk, navigating the menu with analog sticks is muscle memory at this point, so I've largely ignored this feature (I also don't like getting fingerprints on my screens). However, the touch screen controls are intuitive and could alleviate some of the inventory management issues that newer players might experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145"></a><figcaption>V holding a pistol outside of Night City captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quite possibly the coolest feature in the Switch 2 version is cross-progression, letting you transfer your saves between PC and console. This isn't new for Cyberpunk or CD Projekt Red, but it makes this package considerably more inviting. After I completed Phantom Liberty for the first time in 2023, I've been slowly chipping away at a 100% playthrough, and cross-progression makes that even more attainable. The Witcher 3 for Switch eventually got cross-play, but for that functionality to work on day one with Cyberpunk 2077 is commendable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've never played Cyberpunk 2077 and the Switch 2 is your only means to do so, then it's an easy recommendation. The base game is excellent and the Phantom Liberty expansion is phenomenal. However, if you've already played Cyberpunk 2077 and don't feel an itch to return to Night City, then this may not be worth your time. The Switch 2-specific features are a nice touch--and it's great to see CD Projekt Red embracing the hardware--but they don't elevate Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its already impressive pedestal.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-3-gets-first-trailer-and-autumn-release-date">unveiling</a> earlier this month drew some mixed responses; there was, for instance, ample excitement over the fact baby dinosaurs will finally be wandering all over the place come its arrival later this year, but less enthusiasm for Frontier Developments' decision to whip the theme park sim's scientist avatar art into existence using generative AI. But now, the studio has confirmed it's reversing course on the latter after "some initial feedback".
</p>
<p>
Word Frontier would be relying on generative AI to create its boffins first emerged via Jurassic World Evolution 3's Steam page, which, alongside the game's modest system requirements, included the AI disclosure statement - as mandated by Valve - that "Scientists' avatars" would be created using the controversial technology. This, seemingly, referred to the face portraits accompanying employable staff - rather than key characters - throughout the game.
</p>
<p>
Some fans have dismissed concerns around the use of generative AI by pointing out that scientist avatars are a fairly minor element of Jurassic World Evolution 3, and there've also been suggestions the game's 2021 predecessor made similar use of the technology - albeit before Steam's mandatory disclosure rule came into play. But the pushback among the community has been significant enough that Frontier has taken note and ditched its AI usage.

It shared the news on the game's Steam forum, but a longer statement was provided to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback">Game Watcher</a>. "We have removed the use of generative AI for scientists portraits in Jurassic World Evolution 3 following some initial feedback," Frontier wrote. "The team are continuing their diligent work on the game and are very much looking forward to launching on 21st October."
</p>

Frontier, of course, is far from the only developer to have dabbled with generative AI, and far from the only one to face criticism for doing so. Activision was accused of creating "AI slop" by Call of Duty fans after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated art was used in promotional material for the billion dollar franchise</a>, including a Santa zombie crafted with so little artistic regard, apparently nobody at Activision noticed it had six fingers. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">recently drew criticism</a> after releasing an AI generated playable (in the loosest sense of the word) demo "inspired" by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a>.

For all the controversy, though, it's clear AI is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">changing game development forever</a>, and numerous companies, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-generative-ai-is-just-another-new-technology-to-be-tested">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Take-Two</a>, have discussed exploring generative AI "tools". Nintendo's Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">recently addressed the technology</a> too, acknowledging its potential to "enhance productivity", while adding, "There's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For once, the unflappable Hideo Kojima was overwhelmed. Even close to four decades of game-making experience didn’t prepare him for his biggest tribulation so far: developing <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> during the covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>“I thought I can’t pull this off. [I can’t] meet people or scan people, or shoot with people. I almost gave up. And also the staff were all remote, and I became sick as well. I thought it was just the end of the world,” he says through an interpreter as part of a group interview in Sydney. “I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p><p>Even his initial scouting of Australia, where<em> Death Stranding 2</em> is predominantly set, had to be carried out remotely via Zoom, with Kojima painstakingly directing a local contact to document the landscape on his behalf. “Looking at it from a camera and to be there is totally different, so that’s disappointing.”</p><p>For Kojima, those experiences led to a different approach for the sequel. His own sense of isolation that arose from having to develop <em>Death Stranding 2</em> with a remote team saw him reconsidering its tale — yet it’s also this isolation that led to Kojima realizing the perils of digital connectivity.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>Kojima’s curiosity around Australia was eventually sated. As part of a promotional world tour for <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, he has made his way to Australia to chat about the game with film director and his personal hero, George Miller, at the Sydney Film Festival. So drawn is Kojima to the local sights that the noted cinephile says he hasn’t caught any movies at the festival. Instead, he spent the day at the zoo.</p><p>Kojima’s legacy as a game designer is anything but typical, from his earliest days as the creative force behind the much-acclaimed<em> Metal Gear</em> series to his less-than-amicable departure from Konami. And like <em>Metal Gear</em>’s anti-war narrative, tumultuous world events have shaped the <em>Death Stranding </em>series, the first game being conceptualized in the midst of a politically charged climate back in 2016. He points to key events such as Brexit and the first Donald Trump administration, with thoughts of creating a game that focused on bringing people together.</p><p>“[Back then] there was no theme in games about connections,” he explains. And a few months after <em>Death Stranding</em> was launched, the outbreak of covid soon upended everyday life, including Kojima’s. The isolation he felt almost mirrored the sense of solitude that’s so prevalent in the first <em>Death Stranding</em>. But at the same time, he seemed wary about the digital overload that came with having to stay online — to connect with one another — during the pandemic. </p><div><p>“I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p></div><p>“We had internet when we had this pandemic. It wasn’t like during the Spanish flu,” he says. “We could order things online, we could work online, we could connect via Zoom, or you could go to concerts; they do live concerts on the internet. So the society kind of changed to being very digital.” This digital dependence struck him as “not always very healthy,” which is compounded by the prevalence of surveillance technology, such as facial recognition, during the pandemic. The sum of these experiences inspired him to rewrite <em>Death Stranding 2</em> as a cautionary tale.</p><p>The contrast between the two titles’ messages lies in their logos. Kojima remarks that there’s a marked difference between the original <em>Death Stranding</em>’s logo and the sequel’s. Unlike in the original, the tendrils — or the “strands,” as he refers to these lines — are no longer emerging from the title, but are instead holding the name up in the sequel’s logo. “You see the strands coming to the logo. It’s almost like [<em>The</em>] <em>Godfather</em>,” he says, referring to the seminal 1972 crime film.</p><div><p><figcaption>The different logos for <em>Death Stranding</em> and its sequel.</figcaption></p></div><p>Seated at the front of a small conference room in the PlayStation office in Sydney, the 61-year-old Kojima appears more reticent since the previous <em>Death Stranding</em> world tour — perhaps a sign of weariness and prudence in the pandemic’s aftermath. When I attended the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-on-tour">Singapore leg of the tour</a> in 2020, Kojima shook hands with journalists and conducted individual interviews, while fans who attended the event were invited to take pictures with him. “It was an indirect connection to the game,” he said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/12/16/21019773/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-death-stranding-world-tour-machine-hideo-kojima">in an interview</a>. The promotional event was, in a way, an extension of <em>Death Stranding</em>’s themes of connectivity. </p><p>But for the second world tour, at least in Sydney, journalists were invited to a group interview, and there was no fan interaction beyond his appearance at the Sydney Film Festival when he waved to eager fans who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the game designer before the event. I was informed by the PlayStation PR team that Kojima didn’t want to risk getting ill again for the rest of the <em>Death Stranding 2</em> world tour. This feels understandable; Sydney is, after all, only the second stop, and perhaps his bout of illness during the pandemic was alarming enough that he prefers putting some physical distance between himself and the public.</p><p>Nonetheless, he is still in good spirits during the group interview, at one point even exclaiming that he is probably talking too much. “This is another reason why I’m doing this world tour. I couldn’t go out, travel, and meet people the past five years, so I thought it’s about time.” </p><p>Yet, at the heart of Kojima’s introspection is still a desire to connect with people, particularly his fans. Part of the reason he’s working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> is due to their desire to see another action-espionage game in the vein of <em>Metal Gear</em>. <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, meanwhile, has a greater focus on combat than the first, a feature that Kojima also partly attributed to <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-has-more-combat-thanks-to-metal-gear-fans/"><em>Metal Gear</em>’s popularity</a>. With more players familiar with <em>Death Stranding</em>’s idiosyncrasies as a “delivery game,” he’s ready to make the sequel a tad more approachable. In a way, it’s his way of bringing more people together through the <em>Death Stranding</em> series, which he refers to as “a game of connections.”</p><p>“I think we’re a little stronger,” Kojima says of the world after pandemic lockdowns. “If you could use that experience [of connecting with one another] from the game, I want you to maybe use that experience in real life. Not just in your <em>Death Stranding</em> world, but after you go outside, you feel something in your real world every day, and I want you to link what you felt playing the game as well.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/691570/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2]]></content:encoded>
