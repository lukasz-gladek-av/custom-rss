		<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:28">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, the free-to-play vehicular combat game, has had its early access release date confirmed, and that date is August 6th. The announcement comes after a successful open beta was held in May 2024. Players who participated in the beta got a taste of the brutal races and explosive combat that Speed Freeks had to offer. It featured a game mode called Kill Konvoy, where two teams of eight players battled it out to get their Stompa to the finish line first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLRTsjrCP00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">In Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, players take control of different warbands of Orks, with the two modes confirmed as the aforementioned Kill Konvoy, and Deff Rally. The latter has teams of 8 battle against each other, or race to capture points. The game is entirely free to play, with developer Caged Element Inc stating that there will be no pay to win elements. All paid content will be optional and just customisation options. The progress players make in Early Access will carry over to the full release, which is expected later this year. When that full version releases a new map and new vehicle will be added, along with significant gameplay upgrades.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">To play Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, players will need to create a Speed Freeks account. The dev team explain the reason, saying, <em>“We understand that some gamers are tired of making accounts, we get it. But collecting anonymous user data allows us to improve the game, and the ability to get in touch with players directly impacts the number of users that will be playing it. Free to play games have always survived with the assistance of user accounts, and we’re asking you to make one so that it helps create a better, free experience that you guys can possibly enjoy for years.The Speed Freeks account takes a few minutes to create, but we hope that you’ll take that time to quickly sign up and try our game.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, the Gamescom staff sent out an email to the press mentioning some of the confirmed exhibitors, and that list included KONAMI. Indeed, when checking the Gamescom biz app, I could verify that KONAMI has secured a booth in Hall 4.1, A071/D080, which is in the business area.</p>
<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that they'd bring their highly anticipated remakes: Silent Hill 2 and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, that's not at all what KONAMI is showing there this year: as I confirmed with their PR agency, the Japanese publisher will be focusing solely on the popular Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that's extremely disappointing both to us as press members and especially for you as readers, since there won't be any new impressions or information to be shared for either game. It is surprising, to say the least, especially for Silent Hill 2, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch just a month and a half after Gamescom</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date yet for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but KONAMI has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> pre-orders for the retail editions. As such, it is unlikely that the game is more than a few months away from its launch.</p>
<p>Both remakes are powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. While MGS is being made at an internal studio (with some additional help from Virtuos), Silent Hill 2 has been developed by Bloober Team, the Polish studio behind Layers of Fear, Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium.</p>
<p>While Gamescom attendees and fans all over the globe will be inevitably disappointed with this news, it's still possible KONAMI is keeping new info and/or trailers for one or even both games in store for the Tokyo Game Show event, which will take place between September 26 and 29 this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, look forward to our live coverage from the German event in about a month from now.</p>

<p>When Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred launches on October 8, players will get to experience an all new class for the first time known as Spiritborn. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">live stream on its official channels</a> on Thursday, Blizzard unveiled Spiritborn for the first time to the world.</p>



<p>This reveal gave players a look at the design, gameplay, items, lore, and more. You can check out the reveal trailer below. You can also see all of the details you need to know about Spiritborn below.</p>



<h2 id="h-diablo-4-spiritborn-features">Diablo 4 Spiritborn Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-lore">Lore</h3>



<ul>
<li>Calls upon spirits to assist in combat. </li>



<li>Spirit guardians include the gorilla, jaguar, centipede, and eagle.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Design</h3>



<ul>
<li>The design of the class was inspired by the jungles of Nahantu in Diablo 4. </li>



<li>Rather than wear its armor, it fuses armor within the character itself.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>It centers on dexterity and will be the fastest class in Diablo 4.</li>



<li>Spirit guardians are summoned, each having their own skills while summoned</li>



<li>Jaguar spirit guardian is designed around movement, AoE damage, and attack speed</li>



<li>Gorilla is more of a tank with a focus on damage reduction, damage reflection, and defense</li>



<li>Eagle focuses on movement speed, range, and being precise with attacks</li>



<li>Centipede “represents the abstract concept of life and death” that focuses on persistence. It utilizes life steal, poison damage, and crowd control. </li>



<li>You can go all-in on one spirit guardian or choose to mix and match with a combination of the four.</li>



<li>“All about personalization and expressing yourself,” the developers say.</li>



<li><strong>Spirit Hall Mechanic</strong> – gives you more customization options in the form of various bonuses.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-itemization">Itemization</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hybridization, Power Augmenting, Sub Power, and Unique Items are the four primary focuses</li>



<li>Hybridization are items that will allow stats to work together</li>



<li>Power Augmenting that will allow you take skills and boost it to a higher level</li>



<li>Sub powers are similar to skills but don’t exist in your treet</li>



<li>Unique Items such as the Score of the Earth boots allow you to build your character in the way you see fit within the class.</li>
</ul>

The easiest way to reach it is by starting at the Highroad Cross Site of Grace and then heading north to a large encampment. If you haven’t defeated the Furnace Golem in this area yet, you may want to do so.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4c686a9bdd054a8b2c56a84aeec39c5" data-recommend-id="image://d4c686a9bdd054a8b2c56a84aeec39c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows the location of the Highroad Cross." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows the location of the Highroad Cross." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c686a9bdd054a8b2c56a84aeec39c5" data-recommend-id="image://d4c686a9bdd054a8b2c56a84aeec39c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows the location of the Highroad Cross." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To the east of the encampment are multiple smaller Perfumer encampments. High above one of these is a flying scarab that can be easily missed if you don’t know to look for it. When you spot it (using the image below to pinpoint its location if needed), use a ranged attack to bring it down.</p><figure id="" data-id="263de6552a57af585e8c0007fb96ac66" data-recommend-id="image://263de6552a57af585e8c0007fb96ac66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a map shows a specific location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a map shows a specific location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="263de6552a57af585e8c0007fb96ac66" data-recommend-id="image://263de6552a57af585e8c0007fb96ac66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a map shows a specific location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the flying scarab lands on the ground and perishes, you’ll automatically receive the Ash of War: Rolling Sparks as a reward.

We really do seem to be living through a craze for PS1-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>. Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Vultures, you play as a Vulture. No, not a grizzled bird that picks apart corpses with its beak and sits atop rocks for the vast majority of its lifecycle, but a human special operative - an operative who must clean up an infested metropolis through the power of turn-based clicking.</p>

<p>Vultures is neither a linear story like Resident Evil nor an open world. Instead, it's a roguelike where you're attempting to survive increasingly difficult scenarios and "get out alive with the target". At the beginning of each mission, you'll choose from a number of agents with their own combat styles, customise their loadouts, and grow stronger by scavenging things along the way. From my experience with survival horror: take the shotgun and everything will right itself.</p>
<p>Going off the trailer, it looks like blowing off limbs to thwart zombie approaches in tight spaces is the move. Otherwise, there's a strong Resi feel to the item rotating, keycode smashing, and inventory Tetris. I'd imagine with this roguelike, the horror element lies more in the fear of impending death by turn-based RNG or a gaggle of zombies you can't quite outmuscle. If you're after genuine scares and persisting in a space that only gets spookier and scarier, I can't see the bittiness of a roguelike being conducive to that. But then again, I don't think this is what it's going for and/or I'm very happy to be proven wrong!</p>

<p>Ubisoft released its first quarter financials for the 2025 fiscal year on Thursday. With the financial results came praise for the launch of the free-to-play shooter xDefiant.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s release</a>, xDefiant had what it viewed as an “encouraging” start to its life since launch on May 21.</p>



<p>“The game outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per<br>session day,” the studio said.</p>



<p>After its launch, xDefiant reached 10 million players in its first two weeks. The game also saw multiple updates, including the addition of two game modes in Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-just-xdefiant">It’s Not Just xDefiant</h2>



<p>In addition to the success of xDefiant, Ubisoft says that Rainbow Six Siege, The Crew, and Assassin’s Creed have all helped with early financial success. That success comes in the form of $316.5 million in revenue. That is up 8.3% year-over-year as well as up 5.5% from initial target numbers.</p>



<p>The company also says that it’s expecting the upcoming launch of Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows to add to that yearly revenue. For the second quarter, Ubisoft expects its net bookings or revenue to be about $545 million (€500m).</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio, once again, reaffirmed its push to expanding its Games as a Service (GaaS) offerings. They specifically mentioned the upcoming Year 2 roadmap for The Crew Motorfest as well as the Season 3 content for Skill and Bones.</p>



<p>Two games that will no longer be coming in fiscal year 2025 are Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence due to the teams “taking the necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimized KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market.”</p>

<p>Ahead of the game’s global release, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-team-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports has released</a> full details on College Football 25 Team Builder. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, Team Builder will launch on Thursday night for College Football 25 for everyone. It’ll be accessible via <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/team-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official website</a> when it goes live.</p>



<p>As far as what you’ll be able to create, it appears that almost nothing is off limits for players. Features of the mode include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Logo and identity creation</strong> — You can create a primary, secondary, and tertiary logo. You can upload your own or choose and edit a generic logo</li>



<li><strong>Choose your uniform provider </strong>— Nike, Under Armor, or Adidas can be selected. The choice will impact the equipment available to your team as well as patterns on the jerseys and more.</li>



<li><strong>Multiple Uniform Combinations </strong>— You can have up to five total presets. To break it down, that’s five helmets, five jerseys, five pants, and five socks. This gives you 625 different combination options for your school.</li>



<li><strong>Helmet Freedom </strong>— There are matte, shiny, and chrome options for your helmets; custom logo placement, multiple color options, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Custom Layers </strong>— Rather than all one flat image, the designs for your uniform are individual custom layers. On helmets, you can have up to seven layers.</li>



<li><strong>Stadium and Field </strong>— There are eight components overall to choose from. For your stadium, there is no custom stadium creation. Instead, you select one of the 134 team stadiums within the game. From there, you create the name, how the crowd looks, the type of playing surface, the colors of the surface, logos, endzone design, benches, and sidelines.</li>



<li><strong>Custom Roster </strong>— With your team made, you get to modify your roster and set your playbooks.</li>
</ul>



<p>Team Builder Teams can only be used in private Online Dynasties. You can import up to 16 teams per Dynasty.</p>

                    Nintendo's Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) seems useful, but it's coming out at a strange time in the console's lifecycle.                   </p>

<p>Nintendo's Switch launched in March 2017, and all available information indicates that the company is on track to announce a successor early next year. It's that timing that makes the launch of Nintendo's latest Switch accessory so odd: The company has announced a first-party charging cradle for Joy-Con controllers, which up until now have been charged by slotting them into the console itself, via Nintendo's sold-separately <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N33MFPK/?tag=arstech20-20">Joy-Con charging grip</a>, or with third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p>The Nintendo of Europe account on X, formerly Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1813846178439557413">announced</a> that the charging accessory—formally called the "Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way)"—will be released on October 17. It will work with both Joy-Cons and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers/">Switch Online wireless NES controllers</a>, and the charging cradle can be separated from its stand (where it looks a lot like the Joy-Con charging grip but without the grip part).</p>
<p>Power is provided via a USB-C port on top of the stand, which can either be connected to one of the Switch dock's USB ports or to a separate USB-C charger.&nbsp;Other Switch controllers, including the Pro Controller and the SNES and N64 replica controllers, are charged via USB-C directly.</p>
<p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201071/nintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-accessory-gaming">reports</a> that the accessory has only been announced for Europe and Japan so far, though it will presumably also come to North America at some point. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, either.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 is around the corner</h2>
<p>Why would Nintendo release a new first-party charging accessory for your old console just months before it's slated to announce its next-generation console? Rumors about the design of the Switch 2 could hold some hints.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Accessory makers and others <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">with firsthand knowledge of the Switch 2</a> have suggested that the new console will come with redesigned Joy-Cons with additional buttons and a magnetic attachment mechanism. This would likely make it impossible to attach current-generation Joy-Cons, which physically interlock with the Switch and its various accessories.</p>

<p>But reporting also suggests that the Switch 2 will retain backward compatibility with digital and physical Switch games, which could justify retaining some kind of backward compatibility with existing controllers. This new Joy-Con charging cradle could provide current Switch owners a way to continue charging Joy-Cons and NES controllers even if they can no longer be attached to and charged by the console itself.</p>
<p>But that's just speculation at this point. It could just as easily be the case that Nintendo has to keep the Switch going for one more holiday season, and it's eager to sell every accessory it can alongside the shrinking but still significant number of consoles it will sell between now and the time the Switch 2 is released. Nintendo recently announced new games in the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series, which will give past and future Switch buyers a reason to keep their Joy-Cons charged in the first place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has taken pains to make old controllers compatible with new consoles before. Most Nintendo Wii consoles came with built-in GameCube controller ports, which enabled backward compatibility with GameCube games and also allowed GameCube controllers to be used with compatible Wii games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. Wii remotes also continued to function with the Wii U.</p>
<p>One thing we don't know about the Switch 2's backward compatibility is whether it will provide any kind of graphical enhancements for Switch games. Several titles released in recent years, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/nintendo-is-working-on-improvements-to-latest-pokemon-games-after-buggy-launch/">newer Pokémon titles</a>, have suffered from performance issues. Nintendo had reportedly planned to release a more powerful "Switch Pro" at some point in 2021 or 2022, but the update was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/rumour-switch-pro-was-real-but-got-cancelled-claims-digital-foundry">apparently scrapped</a> in favor of the more modestly updated OLED Switch.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced delays for Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence, its two upcoming free-to-play mobile shooters, as part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf">first-quarter earnings report</a>, which is says marks a "solid start" to the current financial year.
</p>
<p>
Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence - a 5v5 competitive FPS and third-person, open-world "shooter RPG", respectively - were both originally due to launch some time before the end of its current financial year on 31st March 2025. However, the publisher has now delayed both games out of that window to give their development teas the "necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimised KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market."
</p>
<p>
Both titles - which Ubisoft is referring to as "triple-A" mobile games - were announced back in 2022, and have hosted closed beta since then.
</p>

<p>
Beyond those delays, Ubisoft's latest earnings report sees the publisher in a buoyant mood, describing its Q1 results as a "solid start" to its current financial year, with net bookings "above target". CEO Yves Guillemot called the results proof the company was "on the right track" after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">disappointing results</a> for its 2022-23 year which saw the company cancel a raft of projects and adopt a strategy "increased cautiousness over the coming years".
</p>
<p>
Some of its Q1 success can be attributed to the launch of its free-to-play shooter XDefiant back in May, which Ubisoft says got off to an "encouraging" start, managing to attract 10m players in its first two weeks of release. Rainbow Six Siege is also said to have seen "very strong year-on-year growth" as far as player activity and monetisation goes, while the The Crew Motorfest has seen "solid engagement".

<p>
As for Assassin's Creed, it continues to be a big winner for Ubisoft; the series is said to have "overperformed" this quarter, with sales getting a boost from Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-gives-us-our-first-look-at-the-new-current-gen-engine">Assassin's Creed Shadows announcement</a>. The company is even reporting its critically panned pirate adventure Skull and Bones continues to "perform well" in terms of engagement and annual revenue per user. All that has led to net bookings of €290m, ahead of its €275m target. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, Ubisoft says it's "too early" to talk about its next financial year, but we do at least known Anno 117: Pax Romana, the next entry in its long-running strategy series, is due in 2025. Up first, though, are Star Wars Outlaws and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, launching on 30th August and 15th November respectively.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/european-game-sales-decline-by-1-9-in-first-half-of-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compared to other places across the world, European game sales suffered the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UK experienced a decline of 30%</a> in the first half of 2024, whereas European game sales only experienced a decrease of 1.9% in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-game-sales-down-just-16-during-the-first-half-of-2024-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Games Sales Data</a> report, 80 million games were sold across Europe in the first half of 2024 on PC and console. Compared to other parts of the world, this is a solid start to the year for Europe, as there weren't many hard-hitting games released in the first half of the year compared to 2023. For example, the first half of 2023 saw games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, and Diablo IV be released and be hugely successful right out of the gate.</p>
<p>Only two of the top ten best-selling games of 2024 were released this year: Helldivers 2 and The Last of Us: Part 2 Remastered. Compared to other big releases, these games had a lower selling price than other AAA games released in recent years, which has helped contribute to the boost in sales.</p>
<p>Looking at European game sales in June at a glance, 11.3 million video games were sold in the last month, which is a drop of 19% from June 2023. June 2023 saw some big releases, such as Diablo IV and Final Fantasy 16, which helped elevate sales massively. However, June 2024 did not see a big AAA game come through this month, which has led to a decline in sales.</p>
<p>The one huge positive for this half of the year was the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring DLC</a>. Looking at month-on-month data, sales shot up by 454% for the base game of Elden Ring alone. For the highest charted game of this half of the year, it goes to Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. However, only physical sales for this game were counted, with no data on how many digital sales the game received.</p>
<p>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD was nearly the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game this year, but it narrowly avoided the title, with Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door taking its place instead. Nintendo has had a jam-packed first half of the year, with games such as Princess Peach: Showtime and Mario vs. Donkey Kong also being released in the first half.</p>
<p>While most places have their digital and physical data tracked, Nintendo's digital data for Europe is missing, making it difficult to know if they are excelling in sales or falling behind.</p>
<p>Overall, European game sales have stayed strong for the first half of the year, with a very minimal decline compared to the UK and the US.</p>

A disillusioned junior at a law firm, Luisa packs up her bags and flees the tedium and numbness of her life for a chance at feeling <em>something </em>through the literal magic of the town of Hinterberg. And let me tell you, <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>is teeming with magic. Across 20 hours of plumbing its dungeons, meeting its townsfolk, and hiking up and down the Alps’ numerous terrains, I was <em>enchanted</em>. It isn’t without some jank, but it’s without a doubt <em>my </em>feel-good game of the year so far, and a wondrous attempt at an indie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Zelda</em></a></span>-like.<br></p><h2 id="h15923"><a id=""></a>A clean escape</h2><p>The crux of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s charm is its simplicity. At the beginning of every day, you will often have a short conversation with another character, and then embark on a journey to one of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s regions to explore a dungeon. At that point, you hike through the picturesque park (rendered in stunning pop art) looking for one of the game’s 25 dungeons, and eventually enter one. Upon its completion, you return to town where you are allowed to shop for potions, gear, and upgrades, as well as talk to some of the townsfolk and other tourists and engage with a straightforward adaptation of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">Social Link system</a></span>. Then, you rinse and repeat.</p><p>By cutting a lot of the filler and bloat that a much bigger game might load up on, <em>Hinterberg </em>is allowed to shine a spotlight on its most honed edges, namely its titular dungeons. Each of the game’s 25 dungeons has some sort of gimmick, and though they begin simply enough, they eventually evolve into much grander fare. An early dungeon funnels you from encounter to encounter via minecart, but a much later one might become a multi-stage auto scroller on a river raft or a puzzle box with the mind-bending perspective of <em>Fez </em>or <em>Monument Valley</em>. Some of them are low on encounters in favor of puzzles (or vice-versa), but each is a mostly refreshing experience that riffs on an aesthetic, as well as a mechanic that fans of dungeon-heavy games might recognize.</p><figure id="" data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot showing Luisa skating on a rail in one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s later levels.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-recommend-id="image://4ace673557e1f2954fee4701233cc889" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it really gets going, <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzling is wonderful. It is never so abstract or convoluted that you’re absolutely stumped, but it does demand focus. The solutions to puzzles are never far off, meaning you just have to think about it for more than a few seconds to piece together what’s got to be done. As someone who can be a bit of a brute, I <em>love </em>this school of puzzle design. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s puzzles are intuitive, and because many of them build off of one another to grow subtly more complex as you progress, you, too, gradually evolve, informally learning the language of its philosophy and getting to gel with it. In a lot of puzzle games, I bang my head against a wall till I triumph over it, but in <em>Hinterberg </em>it felt more like I was in sync with the puzzles and we had achieved a mutual sense of cohesion.</p><p>One way in which <em>Hinterberg </em>remains novel is by inventively playing with conventions and camera to radically change on the fly. One level might present itself as a sort of 2D platformer, another might come across as an action-RPG like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/diablo-iv"><em>Diablo</em></a></span><em> </em>complete with an isometric angle, and some of my favorite levels appear in a snow region whose various dungeons riff on the level design of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, of all things. It even has a Lost Woods-style dungeon in the vein of <em>Zelda</em>, its chief influence, and while <em>Hinterberg </em>remains fundamentally the same through these shifts, it embraces a vivacity as it pays homage to these genres and specific games, and becomes a celebratory and triumphant pastiche of its various forebears.<br></p><p>Speaking of, though <em>Hinterberg</em>’s dungeons lean heavily into <em>Zelda </em>territory, its combat most notably cribs from <em>Dark Souls</em>, though it’s never so grueling. You have a light and heavy swing which can be woven into short and simple combos that might stagger and even topple opponents. When you’re not on the attack, though, you’ll be dodge-rolling like a motherfucker, as well as managing your stamina and MP gauge, which are tied to the use of two abilities which rotate depending on the region you’re currently in. The cherry on top are these super-effective moves called attack conduits which have cooldown timers rather than gauges, and can be swapped out at nearly any time. If this sounds pretty standard, it’s because it is, and <em>Hinterberg </em>doesn’t mess with this winning formula for the sake of player comfort. In a game brimming with novelty, it’s a little disappointing how cut-and-dry encounters grow to be.</p><h2 id="h15924"><a id=""></a>More than meets the eye</h2><p>As Luisa, who has come here to become an adventurer—known as a slayer—ventures out and talks to the townsfolk, it becomes apparent that magic isn’t all that the brochures and marketing machines have made it out to be. Magic came to Hinterberg and transformed the town, which is led by a mayor who seems hellbent on commodifying the experience and pimping it out to as many people as possible. Theresa, who runs the inn Luisa stays at, has never enjoyed more success thanks to the constant influx of tourists, but it comes at the price of the constant <em>noise</em>. Not literal noise, though a club for adventurers does exist just around the corner from the inn. Rather, the noise of gears churning beneath the surface of it all; a noise that threatens to drown out the denizens of Hinterberg who once had a say in what happens in their small town for the sake of capital.</p><p>Soon enough Luisa, who befriends various folks around town and benefits from these relationships through its social system, becomes an avatar for their collective will. As she gets to know people like the smithy Hannah, Luisa begins unraveling a conspiracy that threatens to unmake Hinterberg, whose leadership has tried to capture and sell magic. <em>Hinterberg</em>’s “coziness” disguises an uglier truth as it provides commentary on the things we aren’t willing to do and forsake for a dollar or an ounce of powermoney or influence.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot of Luisa talking to Renaud, one of Dungeons of Hinterberg’s more eccentric slayers.</figcaption><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games / Curve Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-recommend-id="image://ca25fa8189d39274b3a7303f68ad689c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I really appreciated the nuance with which <em>Hinterberg </em>tells this story, which wound up going places I didn’t expect. The game’s very conscious of even Luisa’s role as tourist, and acknowledges how her and many of the people she meets are very much part of the problem plaguing the village. Whether it be for fame, a fantasy-fulfilling vacation, or as a way to exorcize some personal demons, everybody looks to Hinterberg and its magic to solve some ill of their own, but never really give back to the town or invest in it and its people. Instead, Luisa and her ilk come to town and <em>take</em>. If magic were real, <em>Hinterberg </em>believes there’s no way we wouldn’t abuse it, and maybe we’re better off without it. Maybe what we all need to do is take stock of our lives and the lives around us and ask how we can resolve to make things communally better, rather than looking to the divine or magical to fix it all.<br></p><h2 id="h15925"><a id=""></a>10/10, would slay again</h2><p>Despite <em>Hinterberg </em>telling me that I should confront my problems rather than run away from them, I’d happily run back to this game time and time again. The beauty of its rendition of the Alps is hard to overstate, and I was enamored by the mere act of jogging up and down its sumptuous trails. Its top-notch dungeon design only further complements what an absolute joy it was to sink into its world filled with magic. Like the best vacation spots, I can’t wait to be drawn in by <em>Hinterberg</em>’s magnetism again and revel in its luxuries for a long time to come.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fully known as "The Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project," it is a document created by a conservative nonprofit think tank called The Heritage Foundation. The project's aim is to establish policy goals for the possible next presidential administration under Donald Trump and the means by which to achieve them, authored by political insiders with past and present affiliation with the candidate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An external nonprofit organization posting and promoting such a plan is unusual on its face, even if its contents echo the policy platforms of Republican Party elected officials for at least the last two decades. Its plans to radically rewrite laws around taxes, LGBTQ rights, regulation, and more are not dissimilar to the policies of many prior administrations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, 501(c)(3) nonprofits are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/the-restriction-of-political-campaign-intervention-by-section-501c3-tax-exempt-organizations">prohibited from participating in political campaigns by the IRS</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/project-2025-reported-irs-1923145">some have questioned</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if its championing of this project runs afoul of tax law.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's even more unusual is how conversation around Project 2025 has gone widely viral.

We took a look at Project 2025's ambitions to see how it could impact the game development community. The results were disturbing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers should know that Project 2025 contains implications for possible media censorship, worsening health and well-being of workers, and drastic threats to gender and racial equality in an industry still struggling to close decades of unconscious discrimination.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Project 2025 includes &quot;transgender ideology&quot; under the definition of &quot;pornography&quot;">Project 2025 includes "transgender ideology" under the definition of "pornography"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.project2025.org/">Project 2025's foreword,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> authored by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Richardson, PhD, the organization makes an explicit connection between supporting transgender rights and the act of producing pornography. "Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare," he writes, adding that it has "no claim to First Amendment protection."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a wide-reaching expansion of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pornography">the definition of pornography</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He does not mince words as to what action the government should take. He follows this by stating pornography should be "outlawed," and calls for harsh punishments for any involved in its creation or dissemination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned," he continues. "Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is here that we can draw a line between this proposed plan and video game development. Such restrictions may outlaw gender-inclusive character creators like those seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This may also lead developers to stop including transgender characters in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' Bloodhound and Catalyst. It is unclear if the mere representation of a transgender individual would violate the terms, but studios fearful of litigation would have reason to deny their creation altogether.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With regards to its singling out of "technology companies," much is made further down the document in a section on the Federal Communications Commission authored by former Trump administration FCC chairman Brendan Carr. Carr writes that Congress should set about scrapping the current implementation of Section 230 of the Communications Act. Section 230 is legally understood to absolve telecom providers and platform holders of broad responsibility for content transmitted through their services.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Altering its language would allow agencies to hold internet providers, social media platforms, and digital storefronts for the content they share. This could lead to companies who own said services to apply downward pressure on each other to preemptively enforce said censorship.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We should also note that expanding the definition of pornography in vague and uncertain terms may mean video games featuring sexualized characters of any type could be targeted by such legislation.

The plan takes a multi-pronged approach to targeting said protections, and Richardson writes that this begins with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity ("SOGI"), diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI"), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The effects of said action may already be seeping into companies that contract with the federal government. Recently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-microsoft-shuts-down-dei-team-ex-lead-claims-similar-programs-at-risk">laid-off DEI workers at Microsoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> raised the alarm bell that the Redmond-based corporation may be shuttering DEI efforts in advance of a possible second Trump administration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">reactionary backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> against DEI initiatives has also fueled renewed harassment campaigns against marginalized groups and their advocates in game development. The campaigns' furor has grown so absurd that even Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot took time to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yves-guillemot-denounces-assassin-s-creed-shadows-racist-malicious-backlash">condemn the racist reaction</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the dual leads of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a section authored by former chief counsel to the President-Elect Trump Transition team Jonathan Berry, he writes that the Department of Labor and related agencies should cease enforcing what is known as the "disparate impact" standard in determining the existence of racial discrimination in the workplace. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/T6Manual7">This standard</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is shorthand for explaining how regulatory agencies determine if unintentional or covert discrimination has been enabled through rules or policies that disproportionately target people of different racial groups, particularly minorities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eliminating it would likely empower companies to willingly or inadvertently discriminate against workers so long as they do not specify which protected groups they are targeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Berry also explicitly calls for the Department of Labor to "rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics." Employers would be free to discriminate against LGBTQ+ workers with no intervention by the federal government.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, developers should know that Project 2025's assault on abortion access impact benefits studios provide in the United States. Berry's section of the Mandate for Leadership states that the potential next presidential administration should "keep anti-life 'benefits' out of benefit plans."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lever to eliminate said benefits would be pulled through a judicial reinterpreting of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/retirement/erisa">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The law currently denies states the ability to ban companies from providing abortion coverage in their medical benefits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"ERISA should not be allowed to trump states’ ability to protect innocent human life in the womb," writes Berry. "Congress and DOL should clarify that ERISA does not preempt states' power to restrict abortion, surrogacy, or other anti-life 'benefits.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The successful restricting of abortion access has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/insomniac-games-bungie-issue-statements-supporting-abortion-rights">prompted backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from game developers. Many </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/texas-anti-abortion-law-is-a-threat-for-diversity-in-the-game-industry">already worry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that if studios or publishers set up new offices in states with abortion bans on the books, they will have to choose between their careers or their personal safety when considering where they can work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combined eliminations of these protections risk exacerbating inequality in the video game business. If employees cannot fight discrimination or receive equal access to healthcare, they will not have the same opportunities as many of their colleagues when seeking work in the field of game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Proposed overtime regulations in Project 2025 could empower more crunch">Proposed overtime regulations in Project 2025 could empower more crunch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last decade has been marked by workers at companies large and small advocating for an end to "crunch," commonly understood as periods where developers work intense extra hours to meet harsh deadlines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game Developers Conference State of the Industry survey </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/diving-into-the-nuance-of-self-imposed-crunch">indicates</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that while developers still experience crunch, its presence in the industry has slowly declined in response to said advocacy. Those gains could be wiped away by proposals in Project 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These proposals attack overtime benefits from multiple angles. In his chapter on the Department of Labor, Berry argues that overtime laws are too restrictive on companies who wish to offer other benefits like reimbursement for education, childcare, or free meals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As he states, "overtime requirements may discourage employers from offering certain fringe benefits such as reimbursement for education, childcare, or even free meals because the benefits' value may be included in the 'regular rate' that must be paid at 150 percent for all overtime hours."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elsewhere, Berry writes that overtime laws should be adjusted to offer "flexibility" to "employers and employees" to calculate overtime over two-or-four-week periods. "This would give workers greater flexibility to work more hours in one week and fewer hours in the next and would not require the employer to pay them more for that same total number of hours of work during the entire period," he says.</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means that if an employer were to demand developers work 60 hour weeks to hit a milestone, they would be able to not pay overtime so long as equivalent time off was offered in the weeks after. Such a regulation does not account for the strain that excessive work hours can inflict on workers, even in the software industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elsewhere, Berry writes that home offices should not be considered workplaces under OSHA guidelines, and employees should not be entitled to overtime protections while working from such locations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, Project 2025 seeks to reverse changes to the "overtime threshold" implemented by President Joe Biden's administration. Earlier in 2024 the president </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-labor-department-overtime-pay-expansion-who-qualifies-cbs-news-explains/#:~:text=About%204.3%20million%20U.S.%20workers,rule%20from%20the%20Biden%20administration.">announced it</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would raise the income threshold for non-exempt salaried workers to be eligible for overtime. It was raised to include workers making up to $58.6k annually, up from $35.5k under the previous administration. About 4.3 million Americans benefitted from this expansion. This expanded range band covers many junior positions in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Berry states that the threshold under the previous administration was "high enough" to cover "line workers in lower-cost regions," an eyebrow-raising implication that only certain types of workers deserve overtime protections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take-home pay for working overtime could also be reduced under Project 2025. Berry advocates that Congress should clarify that the 'regular rate' for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided." In other words, if your overtime pay was calculated as 1.5 times your total pay including benefits, you would now only receive 1.5 times your base salary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Project 2025 proponents may point out these changes would be counterbalanced by proposals that would expand accumulation of paid time off based on overtime. This again does not account for the physical and mental strain that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/">overtime can exert on the human body</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It isn't unreasonable to expect that if the costs of implementing crunch are lowered, more American employers would gladly push for employees to work more and more hours per week.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Project 2025 is an attack on the video game industry">Project 2025 is an attack on the video game industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A deeper examination of Project 2025's impact on the game industry would need to explore how it brutalizes the civil rights of undocumented immigrants while slashing immigration rates for workers on visas. It would also have to account for how proposed changes to tax law would increase taxes on workers to subsidize cuts to corporate tax rates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But to quote political reporter Dave Wasserman, "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Redistrict/status/1554639811595669505">I've seen enough</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." The Heritage Foundation's ambitious plan for a possible Trump Administration is nothing less than an all-out assault on workers of all stripes, and particularly harmful for the creative and inclusive community that makes game development a joyful vocation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I call out the word "joyful" here because joy is a fundamental element of the art and business of making video games. In one way or another, joy is what we offer players. We create that joy through creativity and collaboration, higher-order skills that suffer when one fears for their civil rights, their health, or their life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The threats of Project 2025 to the well-being of Americans everywhere should be front-and-center in readers' minds, but it's also worth noting how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>joyless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its authors are. The way these people write, you realize they know nothing about the relief of embracing your gender identity or sexuality, the sense of comfort that comes with being in safe spaces at work or out in the community, or the satisfaction of rest that follows a hard 40 hours of work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This document is written by miserable people who are upset that Americans have many ways to find happiness and satisfaction. They seem to be fueled by the same self-hatred powering reactionary campaigns targeting game developers and other artistic communities that have reared their heads since Gamergate in 2014. I half-expected to turn the page and read complaints that "Disney's woke agenda ruined Star Wars." That's how bitter and awful it is!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's inevitable that the authors of Project 2025 would promote policies so harmful to developers and players alike. The only question remaining is if they will have the opportunity to implement them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GDC and Game Developer are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With the release of No Man's Sky Update 5.0 (known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-update-part-i-refreshes-the-universes-flora-fauna-weather-and-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Update Part I</a>), Hello Games has also added NVIDIA DLSS 3 support on PC. Keep in mind that the studio's comparison image is not representative of the frame rate boost GeForce RTX 40 will be able to get after enabling DLSS Frame Generation, as they simply picked the same comparison used for the original DLSS 2 (Super Resolution) when the feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-coming-to-no-mans-sky-and-vr-titles-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-days-gone-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was added to No Man's Sky over three years ago</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man’s Sky | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHiB8g0Klok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3 certainly has the potential to boost frame rates even further. However, Frame Generation currently makes things actually worse when enabled. The game feels far less smooth than it does without it, and it also introduces some weird flickering. Perhaps that's why NVIDIA did not advertise the addition yet. Anyway, I checked with Hello Games and was told the developers are aware of the issue and will be pushing a hotfix. There's already an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/4526764179300014742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimental branch</a> available on Steam, but its current list of fixes does not include DLSS 3 yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a PC-only crash that could occur at the transition from the starfield to the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused graphical corruption on Mac.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to interaction with NPCs on freighters.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when taking damage from the brood mother.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash related to planetary objects.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that occurred when playing PSVR1 on PlayStation 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a whole, this new No Man's Sky update brought many tech improvements to engine, improving both fidelity and performance. Here's the related excerpt from the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li>
<li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate, and saves significant amounts of memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significant memory and performance optimizations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation, and procedural mesh generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is on top of the many rendering enhancements made to the sky, cloud, water, and environmental effects. Are you already back into No Man's Sky, or are you waiting to actually be able to use NVIDIA DLSS 3?</p>
