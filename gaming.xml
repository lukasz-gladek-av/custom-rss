              <p><span>The Nintendo Switch ports of </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> and <em>LeafGreen</em></span><span> have officially been out for just a few hours, which may as well be a few months as far as dataminers are concerned. In the past two hours alone, the internet has been doing its best to speedrun all of the secrets hidden within the ROMs for </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>That includes t<span>he saddening news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-nickname-rival-censorship-2000674512"><span>profanity is now banned</span></a><span> when naming your in-game character/rival and, according </span><a href="https://x.com/_Gon_z/status/2027423326285750594"><span>to one player</span></a><span> who has somehow already made it to the end of the game, the inclusion of the Aurora Ticket and Mystic Ticket limited-time distribution items. You can shiny-hunt Deoxys, but you can no longer call your arch-nemesis ASSCLOWN. Nintendo giveth, and Nintendo taketh away.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the most interesting revelation, according to a dataminer by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027442636810838416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2027442636810838416%7Ctwgr%5Ee6838a986b66fc7a54c129f59ae6b3f7529b29fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000674544action%3Dedit">Yakumono/LuigiBlood</a>, is that the emulator used to boot </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> and <em>LeafGreen</em></span><span> reportedly </span><span>supports ROMs</span><span> for </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Emerald </span></i><span>as well</span><span>. That would hint at possible plans for Nintendo to bring more classic Pokémon games from the series’ GBA days to the Switch and Switch 2 libraries.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to a dataminer, the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen releases from today internally also have compatibility for Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, meaning those could be coming in the future. <a href="https://t.co/MvdB0sJS7N">pic.twitter.com/MvdB0sJS7N</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027442636810838416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luigiblood.bsky.social/post/3mfu5wabxac2t">In a post on Bluesky</a>, LuigiBlood stated that they’d uncovered a few interesting tidbits about the new GBA Switch ports, including that the emulator in question is Sloop, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-emulator-leak-p-1848809116">the same emulator Nintendo uses for the Game Boy Advance games</a> featured in the Nintendo Classics library, and that the ROMs have been “heavily modified and rebuilt.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, that’s small potatoes compared to their biggest reported discovery. “The only other information I will put out is that the emulator explicitly recognizes ROMs of<em> Ruby</em>,<em> Sapphire</em> and <em>Emerald</em> alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-version-exclusives-switch-2-2000674027"><em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em></a>. I found this alongside the initialization code that is related to enabling emulator hacks for specific games.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If this is indeed correct, does this mean that ports of the third-gen </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games might be coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop in the near future? In a follow-up reply, LuigiBlood was quick to state that we shouldn’t be getting ahead of ourselves on that front. “What we see is a snapshot of current code at the moment it was built. It’s not an oracle. Maybe it means RSE is next, maybe it’s never actually happening. It just means they had intentions at one point and nothing else.”</span></p>

<p>WWE 2K26 features a stacked roster of top names from professional wrestling history. The Superstar overalls reflect that, as there are more than a dozen names who are rated over 90.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/48046034/wwe-2k26-ratings-reveal-rhea-ripley-stone-cold-steve-austin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">There was a ratings reveal on ESPN2</a> as part of the hype for the upcoming WWE Elimination Chamber event, and now we know the top 10 men and women in the game, all of whom exceed a rating of 90.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Top 10 Rated Men</h2>



<p>The men’s side of the top-ranked wrestlers in WWE 2K26 is interesting. Many of the names are just different variants of top wrestlers. There are plenty of wrestlers who take up multiple roster slots in modern WWE games, as each slot represents a different era of their career.</p>



<p>The top 10-rated men’s WWE Superstars feature 3 with a rating of 97, and they’re three of the top names in WWE history: Steve Austin, Roman Reigns ’22, and John Cena. Check out the full top 10 below:</p>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-s-top-10-rated-women">WWE 2K26’s Top 10 Rated Women</h2>



<p>The modern-day women’s roster in WWE is as stacked as it’s ever been. Names like Becky Lynch, Rhea Ripley, IYO SKY, Liv Morgan, and Charlotte Flair continue to redefine women’s wrestling.</p>



<p>Their respective ratings in this year’s video game reflect that, and Ripley is one of the only names who would make a top 10 overall list. Check out the full top 10 below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rhea Ripley: 96</li>



<li>Becky Lynch: 94</li>



<li>Bianca Belair: 94</li>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-review</link>
            <guid>1449133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Darkness falls.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the very outset of World of Warcraft’s Midnight expansion, we are summoned by an actual prayer to aid in repelling recurring big bad Xal'atath's invasion of the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. And while I'm all for starting out in medias res, this feels like a particularly hamfisted and contextless way to begin a story. It's almost disorienting at first, and I imagine even more so if you haven't watched the five or six pre-expansion cinematics Blizzard has released at this point. Thankfully, from that point onward, the 10 hours or so I've spent with Midnight so far have otherwise been delightful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riding into the reimagined elven capital of Silvermoon is one of those WoW moments I'm not going to forget for a long time. Its gleaming ivory spires towered above me as an excellent new musical theme that references multiple previous ones filled me with awe. The layout does feel a bit alienating sometimes while on the ground since it's clearly built for flying mounts, and I think there's a bit too much open space. But the level of detail is maybe the highest we've ever seen for an in-game city in WoW ever, with evocative interiors that interconnect in unexpected ways and invite exploration. My framerate has been less than stellar, though.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding legacy areas like Murder Row into extensive subzones with a lot going on helps the city come alive. And I spent more than half my playtime so far without ever venturing outside the walls, excitedly completing every side quest. It's no secret that I'm a big "Thalassaboo," having been a fan of the elves of Quel'Thalas since Warcraft 2. And even the smaller, optional adventures in Silvermoon excellently immerse you in the decadence, pridefulness, and political maneuvering that characterize the city. As an Alliance player, I was also impressed with how much of it we get to explore – only about a quarter of it is off-limits to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the shining capital, Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously. It was already one of my favorite zones in the entire history of WoW, and to see it get such a glow-up, finally healed from the scars of Arthas' invasion all those years ago, is fantastic. The brewing story about the dangers of fanaticism hasn't completely gripped me yet. But Xal'atath's Voidstorm being held back by essentially a giant drain plug that won't last forever adds an ominous urgency to all of it. And I feel like I have a little bit more context now for who Xal is as a villain, thematically, though most of that comes from those out-of-game cutscenes I mentioned.</p><p>Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played several different classes to level 80 in the pre-patch event, which included most of the class changes for Midnight, focusing on my trusty Marksmanship Hunter main and the new Devourer Demon Hunter that unlocks with the expansion. I'm not ready to pass judgement on any spec until I see how they play at max level in difficult content. But as far as Marksmanship goes, I mostly agree with the changes so far thematically. Aimed Shot should be a big nuke that takes a long time to cast. But with the removal of talents like Streamline, the damage needs to feel a lot chunkier than it currently does to earn that fantasy. Our final apex talent, which will give it a 100% critical chance at level 90, could be the answer. We'll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as Devourer, I'm not sold on it quite yet. I like the other Demon Hunter specs quite a bit, but the flavor of Devourer is a bit more caster-coded than the melee monsters Demon Hunters have always been in the lore. Baseline abilities like Consume don't feel kinetic enough to me. They don't feel… Demon Hunter-y, if that makes sense. And it could just be an animation thing. I kind of wish Reap was our main button instead. But the mobility is there, and the mid-range DPS playstyle is interesting. Again, I'll report back on how it feels at max level.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft Early Access Housing Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since player housing, probably the biggest new feature of Midnight, launched way back in December, I've put well over 100 hours into it already. And while the decor I've seen after 10 hours with the expansion proper makes me think Blizzard was <em>really</em> holding out on us with the initial offerings, it's already become one of my main motivations to log in. The tools are very powerful when you learn how to use them, and I'm astounded and inspired to see what some people have done with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, housing definitely shows that it's a first try in some places. The hotkeys to switch between editing your house and normal gameplay are kind of clunky and add too many steps to certain tasks. There are some common sense features missing, like being able to copy and paste a decoration or furniture item if I have another one in my storage. And it's neat that dyes can be made by other players, but currently I get frustrated previewing different colors on a piece, then having to make a shopping list and go all the way back to town to visit the auction house and buy the paints I want. I'd like for that process to be faster and have fewer steps.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions</h3><p>Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/len-ranks-all-the-wow-expansions" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Early Access period for Midnight is well underway as I'm writing this, Blizzard is also withholding quite a lot of key features for the start of the first proper season this time around. Not just raids and Mythic+, but even Heroic dungeons and Bountiful Delves are going to be gated off until March 17. That's a long time! It gives us plenty of space to level and see the pre-raid 12.0 story at our own pace, but if gear progression is your main thing and you're not currently subscribed, you could definitely hold off a couple more weeks because you're not going to have much to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll be updating this review as I make my way through the story and try out a few different specs at max level, with a final score to come some time after Season 1 launches so I can get an idea for how the endgame feels this time around.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-review]]></content:encoded>

"A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to have some sort of cooperative gameplay and ongoing support," the report reads. However, PlayStation canceled this project in January of 2025. Tasked with figuring out its next project, something PlayStation helped with, Bluepoint eventually pitched the aforementioned (rejected) Bloodborne remake.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> fans and the rest of the video game industry are still reeling from the fact that <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, a long-running and beloved studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">was <strong>shut down</strong> by <strong>Sony</strong> just last week</a>. It's another closure that is difficult to wrap your head around, but a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has just shined a bit more light on how things broke down, and also revealed that Bluepoint had indeed pitched the game that everyone wanted them to make: a <strong>Bloodborne Remake</strong>. Only for it to get shut down by <strong>FromSoftware</strong>.</p>



<p>You're likely wondering how that even works, because while FromSoftware created and developed Bloodborne, <strong>Sony</strong> and PlayStation own the IP. They can, theoretically, do what they want with it, with or without FromSoftware's involvement. </p>



<p>Of course, the extra layers to this include the fact that no one would take any kind of Bloodborne project that didn't involve FromSoftware seriously, whether it was a remake, remaster, or a Bloodborne sequel, but if Sony wanted to try and tell players to kick rocks and make something Bloodborne related anyone, they could do it, on paper.</p>



<p>The other layer is something that Bloomberg's report notes that we heard from PlayStation veteran and video games industry icon, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/">Shuhei Yoshida</a></strong>. When his retirement went into effect at the beginning in 2025, the day after he was officially retired, he did an interview with Kinda Funny Games, during which he was asked about why nothing has ever been done about Bloodborne, despite it being one of the most beloved titles within PlayStation's portfolio.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">Yoshida's theory</a> is that FromSoftware, and specifically its president, <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/">would not be against</a> bringing Bloodborne into the modern age with a native <strong>PS5</strong> port or a new <strong>PC</strong> version, but Miyazaki wants to be the one leading the project. He doesn't want another team to do it, he wants it to be a project that FromSoftware takes on.</p>



<p>"<em>I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created," </em>Yoshida said<em>. "I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em>"</p>



<p>Today's report from Bloomberg seems to corroborate Yoshida's theory. After Bluepoint got the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> out the door and worked on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> as a support studio, we know the team moved on to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live service game</strong>,</a> one that the report adds some previously unknown info on.</p>



<p>It was reportedly going to feature <strong>Atreus</strong> falling into <strong>Hades</strong>, not as in Atreus would land in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/"><strong>Supergiant's</strong> beloved indie game,</a> as in it would bring Atreus out of the Norse setting and into the series' original Greek setting, featuring Atreus fighting his way through Hell. The game was supposed to have some kind of cooperative elements to it, but Bluepoint ultimately struggled to land on a game design and gameplay loop that could keep players engaged in the long-term way that is required in live service titles. It was then cancelled at the start of 2025.</p>



<p>It's at this point, according to Schreier's report, that Bluepoint pitched a Bloodborne Remake. Sony was reportedly on board with the idea, and it also wasn't the first time that Bluepoint had brought it up, which is arguably why we've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">hearing rumours for years</a> that a Bloodborne Remaster/Remake project was on the way.</p>



<p>Once again though, the pitch was unsuccessful, as the report adds, "<em>the studio was told that the numbers made sense but <strong>FromSoftware didn't want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process</strong></em>."</p>



<p>So it seems like there's some weight to Yoshida's theory, or at least to the theory that either Miyazaki himself or FromSoftware as company will be the ones to make the call as to when a Bloodborne remaster/remake/sequel happens, if it happens at all.</p>



<p>The report adds that after the Bloodborne Remake was shut down once again, it tried to go back to the hits and pitched another version of <strong>Shadow of the Colossus</strong> that got rejected by Sony. Bluepoint tried pitching games in other Sony franchises as a way to still try and make something original, like a spin-off <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong> game, but ultimately nothing got through.</p>



<p>Then, when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">God of War Remake Trilogy</a></strong> was revealed, and Bluepoint knew it wouldn't be working on it, that seemed to signal to them that it was over. A week after that reveal, we learned that Bluepoint was getting shuttered. An upsetting end to an altogether upsetting story.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" id="177979">Bluepoint Studio</a> was recently shut down by Sony. A new report sheds some light on the studio’s closure, including the desire to remake Bloodborne and why that didn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier of Bloomberg.</a> It was noted that following the cancellation of the live-service God of War game in January 2025, Sony was working closely with the studio to determine their next project. Also in early 2025, there was a pitch to remake Bloodborne. However, while they were told the numbers made sense, people familiar with the situation stated that FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen.</p>







<h2 id="h-bluepoint-studio-pitched-other-ideas">Bluepoint Studio Pitched Other Ideas</h2>



<p>The report also notes that Bluepoint pitched other PlayStation studios on developing new projects. One idea was a Ghost of Tsushima spinoff, but it was not approved. Other studios were said to be wary of allocating substantial resources to another team’s project, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p>



<p>It was also noted that when the God of War remake trilogy was announced without Bluepoint involved, some within the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was being shut down.</p>

              <p>For years, PlayStation fans have begged for a remake of<em> Bloodborne</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Bluepoint Games</a>, the PlayStation studio behind the excellently received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remake, seemed like the obvious candidate. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA">According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the first-party team actually did pitch a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake not too long ago, but FromSoftware rejected the idea.</p> <p>In fact, many at Bluepoint had assumed for a long time <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988">that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake was inevitable</a>. Then in 2025, after its <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project was cancelled, Bloomberg reports that the idea of the studio fielding such a remake was formally pitched within Sony. Unfortunately, FromSoftware wasn’t onboard. While Bluepoint scrambled to come up with other ideas, including a potential <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> spin-off, Sony never greenlit any of the other pitches.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> doesn’t report exactly why FromSoftware rejected the pitch. The only real theory for why is one offered by former PlayStation Worldwide Studios executive Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">in an interview last year</a>. “I have only my personal theory to that situation,” he said in 2025. “I left first-party Sony so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is— because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved<em>&nbsp;Bloodborne</em>, what he created—and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p> <p>All of this suggests that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake by FromSoftware itself could still happen at some point in the future, but that possibility is little consolation for fans who don’t want to see one of the last console generation’s best games locked away exclusively on PS4. It’s also of no use to the folks at Bluepoint who might have had their studio saved if their remake pitch had actually come together.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the ultimate reason for the studio’s closure was a loss of faith among the higher-ups at Sony that Bluepoint could still deliver a high-quality original game as it has once been tasked with. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">The <em>God of War</em> live-service project</a> it had previously been working on would have reportedly featured Atreus navigating the underworld, but shift to co-op gameplay that never came together. Sony has moved forward with a remake of the original single-player trilogy, just without its best remake studio at the helm.</p>

<p>Well, look at this little fella! Our second Grass-type bird starter (following Rowlet from Sun &amp; Moon), Browt has a heck of a pair of eyebrows and some lovely lime green colouring.</p>
<p>They're smoll, they're round(-ish), and they have a big puffy tail. Very cute indeed.</p>
<h3>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon</h3>

<p>Oh goodness, dog lovers beware, we have the bestest boy (or girl) right here. Pombon is a pomeranian-inspired 'mon, fluffy and chipper just like the real pup.</p>
<p>We have a feeling this one'll be popular — just look at their face!</p>

<p>Water and lizards go hand-in-hand, right? Gecqua is a sleek-looking 'mon (more excellent eyebrows, too) who looks right at home in this water-filled region.</p>
<p>Will they give Sobble a run for their money? Who can say at this point...</p>
<hr>
<p>That's pretty much everything we know about the three at this point, and they're the only <em>new</em> Pokémon we've seen too. So don't go building a whole new team in your head. Even if lots of returning Pocket Monsters have already been shown off.</p>

			<p><strong>Fallout 76</strong>'s free <strong>Update 66</strong> goes live across all platforms in a few days, on Tuesday, <strong>March 3</strong>. Dubbed "<strong>The Backwoods</strong>", it aims to revitalize world events and activities while also introducing an iconic Cryptic enemy, the <strong>Bigfoot</strong>. Ahead of the release, a few folks from <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> provided a remote presentation to press (Wccftech included) and answered several questions in a roundtable format about The Backwoods and the game as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="the-backwoods-update-overview">Fallout 76 "The Backwoods" Update Overview</h2>



<p>The most sweeping change in the upcoming update is arguably the <strong>fundamental redesign of how events and activities are categorized and balanced</strong>. <span>What were previously all called "events" have now been split into two distinct categories:&nbsp;<strong>Activities</strong>&nbsp;(designed for one to five </span>players, spawning every ten minutes with up to three or four, including an Enclave activity, happening simultaneously) and&nbsp;<strong>Public Events</strong>&nbsp;(designed for larger groups with greater rewards). In total, <strong>nearly 50 pieces of content were touched: around 25 activities and 25 public events</strong>. Key changes applied globally include tightened timers wherever events felt like they were dragging on for too long, improved reward tables ensuring every event and activity pulls from a global loot table with guaranteed caps and XP, guaranteed legendary enemies at every public event, enemy scaling up to level 125 to match higher-level players, and XP rewards that now scale dynamically with player level.</p>



<p>Two specific events were showcased live: <strong>Moonshine Jamboree</strong>, which received additional ranged enemies and floaters to counter the common tactic of camping rooftops, along with slightly tightened timers; and <strong>Most Wanted</strong>, which had its buckaroo requirement reduced from 600 to 500 and its timer count trimmed for a tighter feel.</p>



<p>Beyond events, the update includes a significant <strong>armor overhaul and rebalance</strong> aimed at making all armor sets viable rather than funneling players toward specific meta builds; <strong>improvements to the Pip-Boy</strong> making it significantly snappier and laying groundwork for future expansion of its functionality; an expansion of the <strong>You Might Map</strong> treasure hunt system, which now appears as possible rewards in activities and events; <strong>improved lockbox loot</strong> scaled to lock difficulty with legendary item chances; <strong>contextual ammo crates</strong> that drop ammo relevant to the weapon you're currently using; <strong>contextual seasonal item drops</strong> relevant to active weekly and daily challenges; <strong>Camp Titles</strong> (a new cosmetic system mirroring player titles but applied to camps, earnable through challenges, quests, and seasons); updates to <strong>one-star mod effects</strong>; new weapon mods and adjustments to armor and power armor mods; a new <strong>four-star Super Sledge</strong>; and <strong>vanity lights in photo mode</strong> for improved character photography.</p>

<h2 id="new-party-crasher-system">The New Party Crasher System</h2>



<p>The update's headline new mechanic is the so-called <strong>Party Crasher system</strong>, which triggers at the conclusion of certain public events, giving an "<strong>uninvited guest enemy</strong>" a chance to spawn. Each public event has one specific thematically appropriate party crasher assigned to it, with one exception: <strong>Bigfoot</strong>, a new four-star legendary cryptid, who can appear across multiple events.</p>



<p><strong>Bigfoot is the centerpiece of the update and the first four-star enemy to appear outside of a raid</strong>. He carries a large club and throws exploding ticks, and comes with a five-minute kill timer, making it a DPS race before he retreats back into the forest. Killing him guarantees a four-star item drop, and he has an exclusive mod called the <strong>Thrillseeker mod</strong> that only he can drop. The spawn rate will be boosted for the first week post-launch, with a dedicated hourly events playlist specifically for Bigfoot, before settling to a lower default rate estimated at roughly once per hour of consistent event play. Bigfoot's footprints were also scattered across Appalachia as an environmental hint for eagle-eyed players, and a hidden secret tied to Bigfoot is discoverable only through the camera/photo mode. Standard three-star uninvited guests are weaker, have no time limit, and always drop two three-star items.</p>



<p>In the presentation, the team also showcased a <strong>Storm Goliath</strong>, which appeared as the uninvited guest at the Most Wanted event. Other confirmed party crashers are the Scorchbeast, the Deathclaw Matriarch, the Wendigo Colossus, and the Mirelurk Queen.</p>



<p>Here's the full transcript from the Q&amp;A portion. The questions were answered by Bethesda's Live Producer <strong>Keaton Bracy</strong>, Senior Systems Designer <strong>Kevin Wienecke</strong>, Senior Producer <strong>Bill LaCoste</strong>, and Creative Director <strong>Jon Rush</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="developer-qa">Developer Q&amp;A</h2>



<p><strong>What inspired the Party Crasher concept, and was it difficult to implement while staying true to Fallout 76's design?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> The inspiration was really about <strong>offering additional incentive to participate in public events</strong>. Party crashers only have a chance to spawn once the event concludes, so if you're a lower-level player and Bigfoot comes running at you after the event ends, you don't have to stick around. It's an added bonus, not a requirement. As for why Bigfoot specifically, Fallout 76 is steeped in cryptids, and we're in a forest setting, so <strong>it seemed like Bigfoot might have taken notice of what folks were doing in his forest and didn't appreciate the disturbance</strong>. It also felt like a fun, challenging way to offer players a different path to getting a four-star legendary outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> When we were choosing which creature to assign as each event's uninvited guest, we went through every event and asked what enemy would be thematically appropriate. You can't just throw a Deathclaw everywhere. Well, you could, but we wanted to make sure the uninvited guest fits the theme of the event it's tied to.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> <strong>The initial idea for Bigfoot actually came from playing Campfire Tales at night, finishing the event, and thinking how cool it would be if Bigfoot just appeared and smashed your face in</strong>. That's where the original thought came from.</p>



<p><strong>What is the spawn rate for Party Crashers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> We're not going to pin down the exact number; the data miners already know it anyway. For the initial launch period, spawn rates will be slightly elevated to add to the excitement of the new content. Once the default rates kick in, it's on the lower end, but <strong>you should see roughly at least one per hour if you keep attending events consistently</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> For the first week specifically, we'll be running an hourly events playlist for Bigfoot, so he'll be showing up much more frequently during that window.</p>



<p><strong>Can Bigfoot appear at multiple events, or is each Party Crasher exclusive to one event?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Bigfoot is the only uninvited guest who can appear across multiple events. <strong>Every other party crasher is specific to one event, chosen for thematic fit</strong>. We didn't want enemies showing up in events where they didn't make contextual sense, so every standard uninvited guest is tied to one specific event.</p>



<p><strong>Are four-star items guaranteed when defeating Bigfoot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Yes, <strong>four-star items are guaranteed when you kill Bigfoot. He has a reduced loot set compared to what you'd see in Gleaming Depths</strong>. It's not the full range, but he has one exclusive mod that only he can drop, called the Thrillseeker mod. That's a rarer drop from him, but it's a good one.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a quest associated with Bigfoot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> There isn't, and that was a deliberate choice. We didn't want the overhead of a quest telling you to go kill Bigfoot, we wanted it to be a spontaneous thing. <strong>He just shows up and you think, "Oh my god, what is that?"</strong> We felt that it was better served without the quest UI framing around it. Sometimes he spawns. Watch out.</p>



<p><strong>What is the time limit to kill Bigfoot? Is this the same for all Party Crashers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Based on PTS feedback, <strong>we settled on a five-minute internal timer for Bigfoot</strong>. If you can't kill him in that window, he stomps off in a cloud of dust. That said, the standard three-star uninvited guests do not have a time limit. They're significantly weaker, so they're not really a problem, though one of them is actually pretty tough. They're a fun little surprise without the pressure of a timer.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more ways to obtain four-star modules beyond Bigfoot, such as through bounty hunting or head hunts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> That's a really good question, and <strong>we are in talks about expanding bounty hunting</strong>. One thing I've said in a few interviews is that when we designed the headhunt targets, we as developers thought they were genuinely hard, and then we released them and players demolished them instantly. Players always surprise us. <strong>We do want to make head hunts more challenging</strong>, and we have tentative plans down the road to expand that feature in a couple of directions that would increase both the challenge and the rewards. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>



<p><strong>How big are Bigfoot's feet in Fallout 76?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> He has two differently sized feet, as you might expect. One foot is approximately a size 62 and a half men's. His other foot is about a size 36. Makes shoe shopping really difficult.</p>



<p><strong>Are there female Bigfoots?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Well, you had to come from somewhere. We may never know. Maybe that's for a future update.</p>



<p><strong>How did you determine which Fallout 76 events needed revisions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> Our first goal was really to establish the separation between what we're now calling Activities and Public Events. Beyond that, we knew these were some of the older areas of the game that hadn't changed in years, while some of the newer public events were already in good shape. We wanted to go broad, touch everything and bring it all up to the current standard of the rest of the game. So <strong>we went through every single activity and every single public event and made sure they were all up to that bar</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be any changes coming for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-qa-the-game-is-thriving-and-we-have-no-plans-to-stop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghouls</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Future content takes ghouls into account much more. <strong>If you're playing as a ghoul, future content will feel meaningfully different</strong>. That's one way we're expanding on the ghoul experience. As for more specific additions like quests or perks, we do talk about those and we have some plans I can't disclose right now, but we definitely want to continue making the ghoul experience worthwhile and distinct from playing as a human.</p>



<p><strong>Given the positive community response to raids, are there plans to introduce new raids to Fallout 76 in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> There are no plans I can speak to, but <strong>there are plans. You'll be hearing about that pretty soon</strong>. We're always looking for ways to introduce more challenges, and bigger challenges mean bigger rewards. <strong>We love raids, and we'll definitely be expanding on them</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Are there more exciting things in Update 66 beyond what was shown?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Yes, absolutely. The Pip-Boy performance improvements might not sound exciting, but once you use it, you'll really feel the difference: <strong>it's significantly snappier now, and it also gives us as developers more room to expand its utility in the future</strong>. We've also expanded the You Might Map treasure hunt system and added those as possible rewards across activities and events.</p>



<p><strong>Bill LaCoste:</strong> A lot of the lockboxes throughout the world have had their loot improved. Based on the difficulty of the lock, you now have a chance to get a legendary item. We've also added contextual seasonal item drops relevant to your active weekly and daily challenges, and contextual ammo crates that drop ammo matching whatever weapon you're currently using. And we have Camp Titles coming, similar to player titles but for your camp, earnable through challenges, quests, and seasons. <strong>There's also the big armor overhaul and rebalance, which is really about letting players play how they want without being forced into specific meta sets</strong>. A lot of the base stats are being normalized across armor types, so you can choose based on look and feel rather than being locked into one set for its numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> There are also a ton of updates to one-star mod effects, new weapon mods, adjustments to armor and power armor mods, and the new four-star Super Sledge. <strong>It's a really broad update that touches a lot of systems people engage with most regularly</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Oh, and vanity lights are coming to photo mode. <strong>When you enter photo mode there'll be a new lighting option that lets you really change how things appear when you're taking screenshots</strong>. And one more thing, there's a super secret tied to Bigfoot that's only revealed under a certain lens. That's all I'll say.</p>



<p><strong>Will more cryptids be coming to Fallout 76?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> I can't speak to that specifically, but maybe there will be. Most of us on this team love cryptids. They are fun to add and fun to blow up. <strong>There may be more</strong>. We'll see.</p>



<p><strong>Are there hidden lore elements or Easter eggs related to Bigfoot in the Backwoods?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> Use your camera. It'll be fine.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> We also seeded Bigfoot's tracks across certain spots in Appalachia ahead of the update. Eagle-eyed players could have noticed them as a preview of where he may or may not appear. It was really fun watching players discover those.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more fishing challenges or legendary fish added per season?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kevin Wienecke:</strong> There are some fishing changes coming. I can't reveal too many details yet, but <strong>there will be new fish to chase, very good reasons to use cooking recipes with them, and completionists are going to like what I'm working on</strong>. Looking forward to sharing more on that.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be camp building updates in Update 66?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Not specifically in this one. We think about updates in terms of identity; who are they for? Camp Revamp was very much for builders and changed everything about how building works. <strong>The Backwoods is more of an adventurer's update</strong>. That said, our player base is mostly a bit of both, so there's always something for everyone. But big structural changes to building? No, not in this patch.</p>



<p><strong>What was the most requested or challenging quality-of-life improvement to add in this Fallout 76 update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> <strong>Probably the Pip-Boy work</strong>. It may not have been the most loudly requested thing, but it was very necessary. <strong>The difference is significant once you use it</strong>: you don't realize how much time you sink into just waiting for it to transition between tabs until it's gone. It's a lot snappier now, and it's one of those things you don't know you wanted until you have it.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-jelly-roll-isn-t-featured-on-wwe-2k26-s-soundtrack">Jelly Roll Isn’t Featured on WWE 2K26’s Soundtrack</h2>



<p>Earlier today, WWE Games revealed the full soundtrack for WWE 2K26. Jelly Roll is not featured on that soundtrack. Rather, this year’s tracks are heavy in the world of Rock. Linkin Park, Bad Omens, Turnstile, and Andrew WK got the nod instead. Check out the full soundtrack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-soundtrack-revealed-linkin-park-bad-omens-more-featured/" id="181124">here</a>.</p>







<p>Contemporary music artists in WWE games are not a new phenomenon. All the way back in the year 2001, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit was featured in two WWE games: WWF Raw on the original Xbox and WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It on the PlayStation 2. Other celebrities who have made it into WWE games include Tyrese Haliburton, Pat McAfee, Mr. T, and more.</p>

              <p><span>Well, folks, it looks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>may have finally broken the series’ bad graphics curse. At least, that’s what it looks like based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, which appears to be a marked visual improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which have become </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><span>a poster child for the series’ poor technical performance</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, released in 2022,</span> <span>were the last Switch-exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, and were heavily derided for not only being a buggy mess, but for looking like a GameCube tech demo. They had a big map that had no real texture or life to it. When they got a Switch 2 update, they ran at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second, but they still looked really rough and old. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, meanwhile, have a notable technical and graphical leap, with much more dynamic lighting, shading, and water physics. The Pokémon themselves have a bit of texture to them similar to </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s models, but beyond that, any direct comparisons we might make work in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’</span> <span>favor. I’d still argue that it doesn’t look incredible by any stretch, but it definitely is the most dynamic-looking </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game we’ve had in a while.</span></p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
