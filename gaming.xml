<figure data-uuid="c15f0e18dd225"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c15f0e18dd225/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are getting ever closer to the release of <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> on <strong>1st April</strong>, and over the weekend, Nintendo revealed its official roster of character posters for the film's main players.</p>
<p>We took a look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marios-joined-by-some-familiar-foes-in-new-galaxy-movie-poster">foe-filled Mario one</a> last week, but an additional six posters have since been released, each showing a different character in a unique locale. These have been shared across the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supermariomovie/">Galaxy Movie social accounts</a> and as a daily upload on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a>, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather them all together for you check out in one place.</p>
<p>Below, we've done just that! You'll find each of the seven posters in the order they were revealed, accompanied by a write-up of some smaller details you might have missed. Let's-a go!</p>

<h3 id="mario">Mario</h3>
<figure data-uuid="2033ad3ec6889"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2033ad3ec6889/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure."</p>
<p>You might have already spotted this one in our coverage from last week, but it's too good not to mention again. Aside from Mario pulling his iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Galaxy</a> 'spin' pose, we'll also give a shoutout to the range of enemies on display here. <em>Sledge Bro</em>? That's a deeper cut than we expected.</p>
<h3 id="luigi">Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cf1ecf62abd60"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf1ecf62abd60/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Conquering his fears, no bones about it."</p>
<p>Luigi's spotlight is expectedly fear-filled, <em>but</em> we do get a closer look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Tostarena setting that we first saw in the film's initial reveal trailer and its skeletal inhabitants. It looks... well, like Tostarena.</p>
<h3 id="bowser">Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="39ee7a3fa8d61"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39ee7a3fa8d61/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"He's got an ax (or two) to grind."</p>
<p>Aside from looking really rather threatening with those two axes held aloft, Bowser's poster crams a lot into the background. The big wheel and Bullet Bill merry-go-round have a whiff of World Bowser from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and what's with that giant UFO in the sky? Huh, looks like the King of the Koopas will be getting big again after all.</p>
<h3 id="peach-andamp-toad">Peach &amp; Toad</h3>
<figure data-uuid="40287951410dc"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40287951410dc/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Always looking out for the little guy."</p>
<p>Wow, there are <em>a lot</em> of cameos in this one. The penguins make a return from the first movie, but we've also got the Galaxy Star Bunnies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s Pianta, a Conkdor, and even some Whittles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. And what's with all of those rockets blasting off to a nearby galaxy? Hmm, a lot to digest here.</p>
<h3 id="rosalina">Rosalina</h3>
<figure data-uuid="de4cce9f161ca"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de4cce9f161ca/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The stars of a new story."</p>
<p>Yep, we're fans of this Rosalina design. There's a particularly cute Baby Luma on the left, and our first proper look at the Comet Observatory in the background on the right.</p>
<h3 id="bowser-jr">Bowser Jr.</h3>
<figure data-uuid="5464d43f9f1e2"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5464d43f9f1e2/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"No wonder he's a menace."</p>
<p>A Bowser Jr-shaped planet, battleships, and a magic paintbrush that spits Piranha Plant ink? It's no wonder those Koopas down the bottom look scared.</p>
<h3 id="yoshi-baby-mario-andamp-baby-luigi">Yoshi, Baby Mario &amp; Baby Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0b37fe21a2978"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b37fe21a2978/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The realistic T. rex model and waterfall-covered planet in the background have us wondering whether the Cascade Kingdom is joining Tostarena as another Odyssey cameo. It seems likely, no?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“No One Is Safe on the Platform”: Developers Call Out Valve’s Lacking Moderation of Abuse and Bigotry on Steam Forums and Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-lack-of-steam-user-reviews-forums-moderation-called-out-by-developers/</link>
            <guid>1437511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's well known that user reviews on <strong>Steam</strong> are a mixed bag, to say the least. You'll get everything from actually thoughtful reviews to snap reactions based on less than an hour spent with the game, and often see a slew of negative reviews that are clearly part of a review-bombing campaign of players complaining about a singular issue, regardless of that issue factoring in on the game's quality.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/16/bigotry-steam-pc-moderation-developers-speak-out">The Guardian</a> delves into another aspect of Steam's user reviews and forums, with developers and even some content creators speaking out about the <strong>abuse</strong> and <strong>bigotry</strong> that <strong>Valve</strong> allows to run rampant on the platform, despite several statements directly violating content guidelines set by Valve.</p>



<p>More than calling out the content itself, the issue developers and creators have is Valve's apparent unwillingness to do anything about it, offering little to no support, even with reviews that violate their own content guidelines. </p>



<p>One example included in the report describes how game designer <strong>Nathalie Lawhead</strong> wasn't able to get reviews with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3mbgpbpewsc2i">antisemitic comments that also mocked allegations she made regarding her sexual assault</a>, without using her public following, and ultimately, had to step outside the moderation process by directly asking someone they knew at Valve to remove the reviews.</p>



<p>Valve's moderators had cleared both reviews after Lawhead initially reported them, which prevented Lawhead from reporting them a second time, since developers cannot report a cleared review without the author editing it. The reviews were also cleared despite Valve's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B">user-generated content</a> and online <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct">content guides</a> citing "<em>insults or harassment</em>," "<em>discrimination</em>," and "<em>public accusations towards others</em>" as examples of what not to do in user reviews. </p>



<p>Lawhead was able to remove the antisemitic review, while the other, which, like its antisemitic counterpart, accused Lawhead of lying about their sexual assault, cleared moderation even after it had been reported by others. It was then that Lawhead was able to get it removed after speaking with someone they knew at Valve. Before Lawhead took that route, all Valve said in response to their report was "<em>We aren't in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews</em>," with Valve adding, "<em>we don't try to moderate reviews based on accuracy</em>," and claiming it was against removing reviews as it could be seen as "<em>censorship</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone is at one another's throats all the time in reviews</em>," said content creator Bri 'BlondePizza' Moore. "<em>It ensures<strong> no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike</strong></em>." For Lawhead's part, getting the response they got from Valve was "<em>crushing,</em>" adding, "<em>the implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it. I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It's an obvious stance. It's a choice</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews</em>," Lawhead added. "<em>I think this entire process of moderation is <strong>broken</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another example shared in the report describes how another developer, who did not have the kind of public following Lawhead did to fall back on, was unsuccessful in getting user reviews removed that had nothing to do with their game, and everything to do with whether the developer properly observed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year.</p>



<p>Their game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785940/COVEN/">Coven</a></strong>, is a first-person shooter and action game described as a "<em>hyper-violent retro FPS</em>," and it has also been targeted by a Steam curator, '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915">CharlieTweetsDetected,</a>' which recommends games based solely on whether the developer has posted something negative or not about Charlie Kirk's death. The developer, who wished only to be identified as Ethan, said that Steam was not interested or didn't seeminigly care that several of Coven's negative reviews stemmed from the curator list.</p>



<p>"<em>For sure, the 'anti-woke' curators brought insincere negative attention to the game</em>," says <strong>Émi Lefèvre</strong>, a developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/">Caravan SandWitch</a></strong>, a game that has several negative reviews that call it "<em>too LGBTQ...there is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians</em>."</p>



<p>Lefèvre continues, "<em>Valve's refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalized people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought</em>."</p>



<p>One developer who tried to report transphobic reviews to Steam was told they should "<em>continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed</em>," language that was exactly similar to what Lawhead was told five years prior, showing no change or growth in its process in half a decade.</p>



<p>"<em>To us, it seemed that in Steam's [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse - but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that's welcome speech,</em>" said Phi, who received the above response when trying to remove transphobic reviews from their game. "<em>We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They're still up there today</em>."</p>



<p>Lawhead concluded, "<em>If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse. <strong>This shouldn't be normal.</strong></em><strong>"</strong></p>



<p>Valve's apparent unwillingness to moderate these reviews or even update its moderation process is only compounded as a problem when you consider that Steam is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/">largest digital platform for PC games</a>, one that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-majority-of-game-developers-believe-steam-has-monopoly-on-pc-game-distribution/">many developers believe to be a monopoly</a>. Beyond the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">economic issues this causes</a>, developers are forced to choose between publishing their games on platforms where Lawhead admits game publishers "<em>don't take you seriously</em>" because you're not on Steam, or stay on Steam, and endure reams of abuse. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Dev Bullied By Toxic Gamers Into Deleting Post About Toxic Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-developer-delete-post-toxic-reviews-2000669452</link>
            <guid>1437502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, recently laid off <em>Highguard</em> developer Josh Sobel opened up about what it felt like revealing the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">at the Game Awards 2025</a>&nbsp;and then watching some of the loudest parts of the internet dunk on the game up through its January launch. One of the things he called out was people <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-dev-who-just-lost-his-job-calls-out-toxic-online-reaction-2000668306">“gleefully” trying to manifest</a> the online hero shooter’s immediate downfall. The response to his earnest inside look at having worked on the game was immediately greeted by such a harsh and toxic backlash he’s now deleted the post as well as the rest of his account.</p> <p>“I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>. And it worked,” Sobel wrote on X on February 12, just days after Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">announced sweeping staff cuts</a>.</p>

 <p>The post kicked off a fresh firestorm from a diffuse mob of angry online gamers and social media clout chasers who used the message to attack <em>Highguard</em>‘s developers as out of touch. They were accused of trying to deflect blame for making a game that just didn’t connect with many players. As happened with<em> Concord</em> before it, some people started looking for any post by anybody who worked on <em>Highguard</em> that they could find to start dunking on the person and the game.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update:</p> <p>Josh Sobel has now deleted his X account entirely, just days after publishing an article blaming gamers for Highguard’s failure.</p> <p>Looks like the deflection didn’t land the way he expected. <a href="https://t.co/IQCneqclUm">https://t.co/IQCneqclUm</a> <a href="https://t.co/faxHwewyK4">pic.twitter.com/faxHwewyK4</a></p> <p>— MasteroftheTDS (@MasteroftheTDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasteroftheTDS/status/2023075675348074690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Look, a few different things can be true here at same time. According to the <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2022730613141442903">data firm Ampere Analysis</a>, an estimated 1.54 million people played <em>Highguard</em> last month. That’s around what Palworld hit when it launched. In other words, tons of people tried <em>Highguard</em> and then didn’t come back. That already makes it completely different from the apathy bomb Concord launched into. It also suggests that despite despite all the people trying to “manifest” failure on social media, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em> had its shot</a> to find a big audience and just couldn’t capitalize.</p>

 <p>But it’s also true that regardless of whether it had any impact on initial downloads and playtime, anyone who paid attention to <em>Highguard</em> at all during it’s launch would have though the developers had advertised the game by dropping kittens off rooftops. Thousands of negative reviews by people who barely played a single match did get posted to Steam and plenty of people online were jonesing for a “Concord 2.0” flameout.</p>

 <p>Even if you think Sobel’s argument that an artificial gravity well of bad-faith negativity hurt the game is wrong, it still sucks that it happened. It’s also, frankly, bizarre. Another overlooked point made by the developer who, remember, had just lost his job working on his dream game, was that Wildlight Entertainment was not some mega publisher chasing market fits on a spreadsheet. <em>Highguard</em> was not a live service game designed in a lab by Excel.</p> <p>Not every game can succeed. Even great ones fail. But you can’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">champion risk-taking in game development</a> while also engaging in witch hunts against people just for placing bets you don’t like.</p>

<p>The fifth chapter of Poppy Playtime is almost upon us, and console fans are bound to be wondering whether they can get in on the action. </p>







<p>It’s not one they’ll want to miss, either, as it’s rumoured to be the final part of the long-running saga. If you’re a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch owner and a fan of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, here’s whether you can continue the journey or not.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On PlayStation 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Watch your step. Image by Mob Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Chapters one through three being available on Sony’s latest console, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime will not be readily available on PlayStation 5 at launch. </strong></p>



<p>The franchise was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released on PC</a> all those years ago, and ever since, the titles have first and foremost debuted there. Console ports were eventually developed for some older chapters, but it looks like PS5 fans will have to miss out—at least at launch.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that a PS5 port will be developed in the future, but how far away it is remains to be seen. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s equally bad news for Xbox fans, as Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 won’t be available on either Xbox console alongside the PC launch. </strong></p>







<p>Xbox fans often get the short end of the stick, with numerous titles opting to miss their systems in recent years. However, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime should arrive on Xbox eventually; it’s just a matter of when. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans don’t fare any better; Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 will not be on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>It might be majorly disappointing for Poppy Playtime fans, but there is a silver lining. As has been mentioned numerous times, console ports will arrive in the future, typically a few months after the PC release. It’s a shame, but console ports take time, especially for Indie devs like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has excelled at delivering grit-your-teeth, bite-your-nails action through the Poppy Playtime series. It’s always been a well-priced franchise for such replayable content, but questions are being asked about Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s price.</p>



<p>Greater quality means more work, which unfortunately factors in increased cost. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> has gotten bigger as the years have gone on, but so has its price tag. Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 could be the end for the franchise, and it could go out with an expensive bang.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Needs more light. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official confirmation as yet, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is expected to cost about $25, possibly going up to $30.</strong></p>



<p>Everything shown from the Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 gameplay trailer suggests this is the most complete game to date. Mob Entertainment’s indie project has gone from free-to-play to a fairly premium price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s unlikely Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is going to buck the trend, and it’s looking very likely that the price will go up again. In keeping with the previous chapter’s increase, Chapter 5 is probably going to cost in the region of $25-30 or £20-25. </p>



<p>Chapters 2 through 4 have seen a five-dollar increase each time. Still, this is mostly guesswork based on previous games and logic, so this is only a prediction for now.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated with the accurate price once the game is out and everyone knows for sure, so keep checking back!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-have-previous-poppy-playtime-chapters-cost">How Much Have Previous Poppy Playtime Chapters Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data shows that each new chapter has raised the price between $5-10, with the first game having started as a free-to-play download.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the first game was (and still is) completely free to play. The journey had to start somewhere, and the price has only gone up as the years have gone by.</p>

"Obviously we want to get that mix right, so no matter what kind of Star Wars media you've engaged with, whether it be a movie or game, there's a bunch of familiarity in there when it comes to the space. Otherwise it wouldn't feel like an authentic Star Wars experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So there's both familiar faces and new characters," Crimmins continued, acknowledging Sebulba and Quadinaros. "We can't talk about who exactly they are just yet though, sorry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who else might appear? While less well known, it's possible that other participants seen in Episode 1's podrace might appear, alongside Sebulba and Quadinaros. The Boonta Eve Classic had 18 participants, though poor Ratts Tyerell died during the race, while Anakin Skywalker... well, we all know what happened to him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've seen racing as an activity and as a sport in Star Wars has been around in many forms, right?" Fuse Games founder and CEO Matt Webster said at another point, going on to potentially hint at racers from other parts of Star Wars being included. "Episode 1's podracing we all know and love, Bad Batch's riot racing in Season 2 was just awesome. Star Wars Resistance has got the Aces and low-altitude starfighter racing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Galactic Racer is set sometime after Return of the Jedi, so anyone could potentially put in an appearance. It seems unlikely we'll see Luke Skywalker, who was quite busy doing other things during this period, but who knows? He sure knows how to race a speeder bike across Endor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week brought our best look yet at Star Wars: Galactic Racer, though we delve much deeper into its clever two-tier boost system, environmental effects, and how the game will let you nuture rivalries and interact with characters on foot in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">big Star Wars: Galactic Racer interview that you can go read right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>The first thing I noticed about turn-based tactics game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dobbel-dungeon">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is that you can see fingerprints on the playdough character models. Even hard metallic objects such as swords are decked with faint, glimmering whorls. I’d have liked the game to let me leave my own prints on those playdough characters, care of the biometrics functionality I assume is secretly built into my work laptop. Perhaps they could have made this part of a proper degradation system, with high level characters looking all greasy and smooshed.</p>
<p>Alas, Dobbel Dungeon has no time for such <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a>-grade simulation elements. Going by the demo, it is simply a cheerful and well-made, tabletop-style game of leisurely flanking and special ability usage with a gentle twist. The twist is that every time a character takes a turn, they fling a bunch of dice. These dice are then slotted into ability boxes to perform them. Some abilities deal effects proportionate to the dice score – stick a dice roll of 5 into a fireball and you’ll inflict 5 points of damage. The three starting characters also have the ability to reroll one die per turn. </p><!--more-->

<p>I’m not sure it’ll get too fiendish, going by the laidback presentation, but I can imagine scenarios where you’re umming and erring over whether to spend a 3 on a healing spell, or reroll in the hopes of that 6 you need to one-shot a boss boggo. </p><p>The Dobbel Dungeon feature rundown hints that “if you find yourself disagreeing with your dice, there are ways to ‘gently nudge’ them in the right direction via various manipulative actions gained through items and skills”. Hey, they’re trying to make us cheat! No <em>thank</em> you, Gamepie. You won’t find me trying to get one over Lady Luck. You won’t find me strolling down the Trickster's Highway. In the shorter term, the maps are pleasant to gaze down upon, the music is catchy in a Viva Pinata sort of way, and the controls and interface feel like second nature.</p>
<p>The story here is that a witch’s cottage has blown up and transformed local wildlife into slightly angrier, humanoid-looking wildlife. It's definitely not in the same bracket of atrocity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mewgenics-review-a-roguelite-where-sacrificial-arse-maggots-and-frightful-defecation-are-the-keys-to-success">Mewgenics</a>.</p>
<p>You get a hub town with surrounding jetties that ship you out to islands full of individual mission-battles. You’ll also encounter merchants where you can buy gear for your clayfaced critter clubbers, and yes, there are the expected skill trees. All very genre-standard, but executed with enough bouyancy that I can see myself plugging on for another few hours.</p>
<p>Dobbel Dungeon is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">out today on Steam</a>. There’s still a demo as of writing, but demos tend to vaporise fast, once the game is on sale. For a considerably less saccharine take on the ‘what if your characters were made of physical arts and crafts materials’ racket, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mashina-is-a-chill-stop-motion-adventure-with-friendly-robots-from-the-judero-team">Mashina</a>, which we really should have reviewed. Curse the limitations of my non-playdough body.</p>

<p>From a new map to multiple new weapons and vehicles, it’s a great time to jump back into the war and fight on the frontline. But make sure you don’t miss the start times if you want to get in early for the new progression. </p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared its Winter Roadmap for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>The roadmap includes a community parkour challenge, as well as full manual jump, a detailed stats page and critical hit visual improvements. These particular upcoming additions all arrive tomorrow, 17th February.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has said Shadows' upcoming detailed stats page will be ideal for "all the min-maxers out there". As for that manual jump being added to Parkour, players will need to enable Advanced Parkour Options in the gameplay settings to get this chap working.</p>
<p>If you are curious about that aforementioned community parkour challenge, here is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535499747044098727">Ubisoft</a> has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your perfect one-shot run</li>
<li>Think flow, style, momentum. Choose a unique location or craft the coolest combo you can imagine. Your clip must be: One unedited shot, 45 to 60 seconds long and set anywhere in the world of Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>
<li>Upload and share: Upload your run to YouTube before March 8th, then share it on X using #ACShadowsParkourChallenge.</li>
<li>Get noticed: You might become one of the lucky few that'll be showcased across Ubisoft social media or win cool prizes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then looking ahead to next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> players can expect the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a> on 10th March. This expansion introduces a new region, as well as a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. Ahead of its release elsewhere, Ubisoft said this expansion would add over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>
<p>Last up for this batch of winter events, all players can look forward to livestreams and giveaways to celebrate the game's first anniversary on 20th March.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong debut on its release last year, and in July Ubisoft celebrated five million players (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">which also made up 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted</a>). That number will of course be higher now, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Shadows' Switch 2 release in December</a>.</p><p>It hasn't all been good news for the Assassin's Creed franchise and Ubisoft, though. In October, then-Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté left the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios. It soon transpired that Côté "did not walk away" but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">it was reported Côté was suing Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation is finally picking up some momentum, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">having been initially announced several years ago</a>. The show is set to star Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor said to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-is-considering-a-switch-2-price-hike-this-year-according-to-new-report</link>
            <guid>1437448</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c2c025ed95807"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2c025ed95807/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rising demand for RAM for AI data centres and the associated rising costs are having a massive effect across the tech world, and with Sony reportedly pushing back the launch of its as-yet-unannounced PS5 successor, Nintendo is considering raising the price of Switch 2 in 2026, too, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">a new Bloomberg report</a> (paywall).</p>
<p>Speaking to "people familiar with its plans", Bloomberg reports that Sony is now eyeing 2028/29 for its next console hardware, and that Nintendo is looking at how to approach what the article says is being coined "RAMmageddon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">Niko Partners predicted</a> that Nintendo would be forced to follow suit and raise hardware prices as its competitors have.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the possibility of a price increase in an interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">back in January</a>, but refused to be drawn on plans at the time, saying "I cannot comment on hypotheticals".</p>
<p>With most tech firms reliant on memory and microchips produced by other companies, this precarious situation around RAM manufacturing has been a concern for some time now, with the crisis growing as AI-invested firms such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchase DRAM for data centres to drive chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Prices have been driven up at an alarming rate as demand outstrips component availability, with Bloomberg stating that the "cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January" alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, tech firms must choose between slimmer profit margins or raising prices in an already-fraught economic environment. The Switch 2's launch pricing and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price tag <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">proved controversial</a> with gamers in June last year, and Nintendo raised the price of all its Switch 1 hardware in the US <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">last summer</a>. Sony and Microsoft both <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-series-xs-how-their-prices-have-changed-over-the-past-five-years">raised their hardware prices recently</a>, with PlayStation getting a $50 hike on all PS5 models in the US <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/ps5-price-increases-confirmed-for-usa-effective-21st-august">last August</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have gotten its latest console to market ahead of full-scale "RAMmageddon", but it still has to keep the ball rolling and keep up production numbers. With the tech sector's reliance on RAM for almost everything and the AI bubble yet to burst, one thing is for certain: Switch 2 certainly isn't getting <em>cheaper</em> anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Are you tempted to push the boat out for a Switch 2 before it gets even more expensive? Happy you jumped in early? Let us know below.</em></p>

              <p>Roger Clark, who plays&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s lead character Arthur Morgan, has a sideline in Cameo messages. The actor recently posted to his X account (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">thanks&nbsp;<em>IGN</em></a>) to talk about an all-time favorite request he’d received, from a man who had just deleted his fiance’s&nbsp;<em>RDR2</em> save game and was looking for any hope of getting out of trouble.</p> <p>“I just deleted by fiance’s saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident,” began the anonymous buffoon’s message to Roger Clark. And as if that weren’t bad enough, he underlined the severity of the situation. “She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed.” Oh dude. There’s surely no coming back from this.</p>

 <p>Although reaching out to Arthur Morgan himself is likely an excellent first step. Posting <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022059161887137920%7Ctwgr%5E9637e6ec535fb2abda3e575092f1fa3e90fd65de%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flet-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">to his X account</a>, Clark told his followers how much he values their support on his Cameo, thanking them for “liking my shout outs.” He notes that he enjoys them all, but adds “it’s ones like these that I live for.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo. Thank you for liking my shout outs. I enjoy them all but it’s ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes.

After explaining the situation, the requester added, “Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?”</p>

 <p>What a situation to be in. This is dozens of hours of impassioned playing, lost forever, somehow not stored in the cloud. And this is a fiance, remember—it’s not too late for her to walk away without any paperwork. Will a message from the game’s main character be enough, or will that just rub salt in the wound?</p>

 <p>The agonizing thing is, unless the perpetrator reveals himself, we’ll never know how this worked out! Did the message patch things up? Is she some sort of angel who can forgive an enormity of this scale? Please, anonymous person, find your way to Reddit.</p>

              <p>I hope Capcom doesn’t spoil<a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em> Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>‘s momentum with an annualized release roadmap. Someone modded Goku into <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></a>. And I bet you can’t guess how upset God of War’s creator is at the new 2D <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367"><i>God of War Sons of Sparta</i></a><em>&nbsp;</em>game. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. All the clipped drama that’s fit to print!</p> <p>Let’s remember some games. How about <a href="https://x.com/RagnarSan22/status/2022639748796588448"><em>Radiata Stories</em></a>? Now <em>that </em>was a great game. <a href="https://shmuplations.com/radiatastories/">Here’s an interview</a> with its development team, including its director, Naoki Akiyama, who, as far as I can tell, hasn’t worked on a new game since. It’s one of the only JRPGs that’s ever been brave enough to <a href="https://kotaku.com/revisiting-radiata-stories-my-favorite-video-game-as-a-1819006170">let you kick kids</a>. “Radiata Stories is supposed to feel like these characters are really living this world, and for that, kicking seemed like the perfect interaction,” he said.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Resident Evil</em> game every year until 2030</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) RE"10" (though likely won't be called that) is a bit shorter than usual (presuming RE10 doesn't get delayed too, it's right now aiming for a 2029 release date, but could be delayed to 2030, 2031 at worst, up to the whims of game dev), &amp; DLC for RE9 has had time to cook.</p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s what a new leak from <em>RE</em> insider AestheticGamer, formerly known as Dusk Golem, <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022244942085832763%7Ctwgr%5Ef221d152e261de65c9565b722ec4964e84884a3f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000669435action%3Dedit">is claiming</a>. They suggest the horror franchise’s upcoming roadmap is as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> – February 27</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem DLC</em></strong> – TBA 2026</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica Remake</em></strong> – 2027</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil Zero Remake</strong></em> – 2028</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil 10</strong></em> – 2029</li> </ul> <p>That is a relentless amount of zombie knifing action. Some fans might think this unverified pipeline rumor sounds too good to be true. I think it sounds like way too much. Hype levels for Resident Evil Requiem are currently off the charts and it’s not just because Leon is back and the previews have all been very solid. It’s also because it’s been five years since the last mainline game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, and three years since the last remake, <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p>

 <p>In an era of way too many games, four remakes and sequels in four years might look great on an investor sheet but it feels like overkill for a franchise that’s currently at the top of its game. And we all know what happened the last time<em> Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review-5948171">got overexposed</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> has a new roadmap and it doesn’t include Cardi B skins</h2> <p>After a rough couple of years, Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale is <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap">promising to double-down on rapid improvements</a> and new content, including two new characters joining in 2026. What this roadmap doesn’t include is a bunch of wild crossover skins.</p> <p>“When we’re designing skins, we try to keep in mind the personality of the Legend,” lead Legend designer Brett Marting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/titanfall-legacy-change">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We haven’t always hit it perfectly, but most of the time we do try to keep that in mind when we’re picking a skin for a character, or a visual to match with them. We like to hit their personality, otherwise it’s going to feel off for the entire immersion of everybody playing the game.”</p>

 <h2>Who needs a <em>Dragon Ball</em> racing game when you’ve got Goku in <em>Sonic CrossWorlds</em>?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn">https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn</a></p> <p>— Boost ☆ 🇵🇷🐵 (@Boos2fer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boos2fer/status/2022173524384002530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Sega go-kart game continues giving <em>Smash Bros.</em> a run for its money with all of the crossover characters getting added, but where licensing deals fail, modders will prevail. Someone recently replaced the Monkey Ball character in the game with Kid Goku riding on his Nimbus cloud and it looks really awesome (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-goku-fan-creation/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). I hope Bandai Namco is paying attention.</p> <h2>No <em>Spider-Man</em> on Xbox, probably</h2> <p>Fans have been told over and over again that the game will never be ported to Xbox. Insomniac Games responded to the latest wave of speculation as more companies explore multiplatform releases to reiterate that its Spider-Man games coming to Xbox remains “<a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766">unlikely</a>.”</p> <h2><em>God of War</em>‘s creator loses his mind over the new pixel art prequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Jaffe absolutely  rips the new GoW game apart.

Jaffe, never one to flinch when it comes to exploring the full range of the King’s English, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k">unloaded on the game in a recent video</a>.</p>

 <p>“Every time you make a new game, you don’t have to go, ‘You know what? Let’s not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let’s see him as a little kid, some generic boring little fucking kid,'” he said. “It’s just insulting to the fans.

<p>It’s been a while since a new chapter brought the nightmare-inducing Huggy Wuggy to the fore, which is why you should check out Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s release date and start times to let some new horrors fester.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> is rumored to be the final part of the saga. Whether this ends up being the case remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: You shouldn’t miss out on Chapter 5. The Prototype is there to explore in its entirety, and it’s not long until you can do so.</p>

<p><strong>Mob Entertainment has issued a February 18 release date for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been on this journey to this point, number one, you’re brave, and number two, this could be the culmination of a five-year journey that has seen hilariously evil-looking Poppy Playtime merch appear all over the world and capture the minds and haunt the dreams of everyone in that time.</p>

<p>Huggy Wuggy has been anything but cute and adorable in that time (maybe the most misleading name in history), and it’s back to chase you around The Prototype.</p>



<p>The new chapter is scheduled for February 18, so prepare yourself.</p>

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

			<p>Last month, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios </strong>announced that the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, would be making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">console debut on February 26, 2026</a><strong>.</strong> Now, less than three weeks after that announcement, the studio has confirmed that ICARUS: Console Edition has been delayed by <strong>one month</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles on <strong>March 26, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>In a statement sent to Wccftech, the studio says that while the game is "<em>in a strong and stable state</em>," the delay will add enough time for the team to add further polish, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>After careful consideration, we've decided to move the release date to Thursday, March 26,</em>" the studio begins in its statement. "<em>This additional month will allow us to polish the gameplay and ensure the best possible launch."</em></p>



<p>"<em>While the game is in a strong and stable state, we've identified a few areas that need further refinement. Rather than launch with known issues, we believe taking these extra weeks is the right decision for the game and players. Our team is fully focused on polishing the experience and game content to ensure it plays as intended across Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Thank you for sticking with us, we're looking forward to welcoming you to Icarus soon</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the announcement of the delay, RocketWerkz has also revealed that it will host an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/">AMA session in the r/SurvivalGaming Reddit tomorrow</a>, Tuesday, February 17, beginning at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>, to give players a chance to ask any and all questions they have about the console edition, the delay, and anything else ICARUS-related.</p>



<p>The upcoming console edition will include the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and if you pre-order the Console Edition, you'll also receive the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>. On top of the base game, this gives those new to ICARUS plenty to dive into when it arrives on consoles next month.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Preview – Is An Emphasis on LTMs Enough to Reinvigorate EA’s 2025 Hit in 2026?]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1437406</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> launched in October 2025, I couldn't help but be enamoured with it. I have years of memories in previous Battlefield games, and I was happy to see the series return with a very solid military shooter. It was, for the most part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">exactly what I wanted</a> out of a modern Battlefield game.</p>



<p>I was one of the millions of players jumping into Battlefield 6 constantly during those opening weeks, especially with the arrival of <strong>Season 1</strong>, with three new maps, the new battle royale <strong>REDSEC</strong> mode, and new weapons, gadgets, and vehicles to earn. I was also one of the players who found the stretch between each phase, and the new content that came with it, to be coming at a slower pace than what I would've liked.</p>



<p>Which wouldn't have been too much of an issue if the progression system through the battle pass and unlocking new weapons and accessories wasn't also extremely slow. Thankfully, that's something EA has already been clear <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-looking-ahead-to-season-2">it'll look to address</a> in Season 2, but whether it'll actually be better tuned this time is something we won't know until we're into the full swing of Season 2 when it arrives on <strong>February 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>So while I can't talk about most of the retooling that EA and Battlefield Studios have done for Season 2, after spending two hours playing Conquest and Escalation on the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, I can talk a bit about what Season 2 has in store.</p>



<p><em><strong>For more on Battlefield 6 Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown</a> of everything coming from last week's full reveal.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-impressions">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Impressions</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reiterate, all I got to play from Season 2 was the new Contaminated map. We weren't given the chance to check out the new <strong>Hagental Base</strong> map, the new <strong>Nightfall</strong> mode, or <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, which are all set to arrive later in the season. So these impressions will just be focused on the Contaminated map and some of the weapons arriving in the Extreme Measures phase of Season 2. I specify just the weapons because I unfortunately didn't get a chance to check out Little Bird. Unlucky respawns meant I didn't get a chance to grab it before someone else, and with only a couple of rounds played across the two hours, I was grounded for the whole session. </p>



<p>For what I did get my hands on: starting with the Contaminated map, which honestly felt like a pretty bog-standard Battlefield map. It's got a couple of great interest points that make for good concentrated battles, but unlike my first impressions of Blackwell Fields and Eastwood, I didn't feel there was anything separating Contaminated from the rest of the pack of maps already available in Battlefield 6. It's a slightly different flavour of maps like Mirak Valley, which isn't the worst thing to be, but it also doesn't make for an exciting first new map since November 18, when Eastwood launched.</p>



<p>What's more exciting about the Contaminated map is something that doesn't directly relate to the map at all. The introduction of the <strong>VL-7 </strong>hallucinogenic smoke is probably my favourite new feature added with this new season. It's not a survival layer because the gas itself doesn't do damage to you if you're running in it without a gas mask, but it will make you see things that aren't there almost immediately if you don't have a gas mask on.</p>



<p>It makes for more interesting close-quarters combat and is another gameplay layer that I would welcome on every other map. It's a shame that, at least for now, it only features on Contaminated in multiplayer and on Fort Lyndon in Guantlet. I understand that it's only on those maps for narrative reasons at the moment, but I would love to see it used more liberally and add that layer to other game modes. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>I know some might find it annoying to deal with, but I think the VL-7 gas will make for more chaotic and engaging fights.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures, the new DMR, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a solid addition and will probably be my new choice of DMR, but my appreciation for it was outweighed by my lack of appreciation for the new assault rifle, the <strong>VCR-2</strong>.</p>



<p>My hope would be that it gets tuned in an upcoming patch, because it felt absolutely useless in the few rounds I tried it. I should say again that I only had two hours to check everything out, which doesn't leave a lot of time to get stuck in menus trying out different attachments. I went with the default layout, swapping to a couple of its different pre-determined builds, but nothing seemed to help. I'll add one more caveat that, because I was playing a build that was flagged as a "<em>work-in-progress build</em>," there could be a bug causing the weapon to do less damage than it should. Again, I would hope that's the case, but as someone who enjoys playing as the Assault class and utilizing an array of assault rifles, it flat out sucks to see the newest one be as useless as this.</p>



<p>I did, however, quite enjoy using the new <strong>M121 A2</strong> belt-fed LMG for the reps I had with it. Again, you can only get so much experience with everything in just two hours. But as Meatloaf always reminds me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s">two out of three ain't bad</a>, so I'd still call the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures to be an overall win.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Coming back to the question I asked in the title of this preview, could LTMs like the addition of VL-7 gas and the upcoming Nightfall mode and Operation Augur be enough to bring lapsed Battlefield 6 players like myself back to the game? It's possible, of course, but it'll depend on how quickly Battlefield Studios and EA are in responding to player feedback, especially if that feedback is similar to what I would offer, which is that the addition of features like the VL-7 gas should stick around and not be limited.</p>



<p>Regarding Nightfall, it'll also depend on whether the mode is executed in a similar fashion to the VL-7 gas, where it adds a fun layer of chaos or if it pushes further into the territory where it's frustrating to play through. And as for Operation Augur, frankly, that seems like it'll be the most fun by the time it comes around, which makes it even more disappointing for me that we didn't get a chance to try it out in this preview.</p>



<p>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</p>



<p>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Season 2 right now.</p>

<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has confirmed that the visuals will not be lowered for the multiplatform release. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has already been released for Xbox and Switch 2, and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth</a> has also been confirmed for both platforms. The developers have announced that FFVII Remake Part 3 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on additional platforms</a> as well. However, players have expressed concerns that optimizing for lower-spec systems might compromise the graphics quality. The director has now addressed these concerns and assured players.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-won-t-impact-the-visuals">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Multiplatform Release Won’t Impact the Visuals</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 director Naoki Hamaguchi said the multiplatform release would not affect the graphics. Hamaguchi stated, “our decision to go&nbsp;multiplatform&nbsp;with&nbsp;the FFVII Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment.&nbsp;Our development structure simply&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;work that way&nbsp;to begin with.&nbsp;…I suppose&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;just have to keep saying&nbsp;it.” </p>



<p>The director split it into 4 aspects to explain how quality won’t be affected. First, he stated that, in terms of ROM, none of the platforms is a concern. Coming to RAM, the Switch 2 has “ample” memory, whereas the Xbox Series S has its limits, but they optimize&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;platform individually. </p>



<p>Coming to CPUs, the studio doesn’t&nbsp;“design the game to fully saturate a high-end CPU at 30fps”; instead, they “scale density elements,&nbsp;like&nbsp;increasing the number of NPCs in towns”. Lastly, for the GPU, the director stated that assets are created for&nbsp;high-end environments first, then optimised for each platform’s constraints. The highest-end environment is PC, PS5, and PS5 Pro, which are considered mid-range platforms. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is sticking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 4</a>. The Switch 2 gameplay experience for FF7 Rebirth will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to other platforms</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has confirmed that the upcoming open world action adventure game does not have a cosmetic cash shop or microtransactions of any kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert, due out March 19 priced $69.99, is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. But one thing players won’t have to contend with is a cosmetic cash shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop,” Will Powers, director of marketing at Pearl Abyss America, told weekly talk show <a href="https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=JPSch4-nwZYHCeDv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Okami13_</a>). “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s a monetization model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that’s microtransactions ruled out, which is sure to go down well with gamers who are hoping for a traditional single-player experience from Crimson Desert. The game has been slowly gaining hype over recent years, but that’s ramped up significantly in the last few months as Pearl Abyss shared more gameplay footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-reveals-more-about-combat-and-progression-confirms-dual-wielding-and-a-bear-you-can-actually-ride-on">You can even ride a bear</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Powers has called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor. "The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Powers said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-going-gold-crimson-desert-developer-deep-in-optimization-phase-to-make-the-game-run-as-good-as-it-possibly-can-before-launch">the developers were doubling down on the "optimization phase”</a> in a bid to get performance as smooth as possible across all platforms ahead of Crimson Desert's release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>1437379</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> gameplay trailer reveal, I sat down with the game's makers for an in-depth chat revealing its new systems and story mode, and a proper discussion on why this marks the triumphant return of track-based racing, after so many open world games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Galactic Racer is the first project from British studio Fuse Games, which was founded in 2023 by a core of former colleagues from Criterion, the beloved band behind Burnout and later Need for Speed titles, before it got gobbled up to become part of Battlefield Studios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as Fuse Games' team races towards a galaxy far, far away, I caught up with its CEO and founder Matt Webster, plus creative director Kieran Crimmins, for an intriguing chat on what's to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obviously you've been announced for a little while now, but I've been looking forward to seeing more from the moment Fuse Games was announced, considering your long heritage at Criterion. And the game looks great, from what I've seen of it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Matt Webster:</strong> Was it along the lines of what you imagined? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, I remember you did that </strong><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GI interview</strong></a><strong> and you were sort of hedging your bets on what genre of game you were going to be working on... And I was like, 'they're clearly making a racing game, I don't even know why they're pretending.'</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kieran Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] We've made spaceship stuff before, so that was possible. It's not [what we're making] but possible. Who were we kidding!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Maybe you were working on another Battlefield game! But probably not. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, fair enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I had lots of questions about what </strong><em><strong>kind </strong></em><strong>of racer you guys were planning to make — open world or not, and we'll get onto that. But when you made that announcement about first setting up, did you have an outline of what you wanted to do? What was that journey like from leaving Criterion to the announcement of Star Wars? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> We thought we were going really fast, but we're three years old now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> That's crazy isn't it, you've made whole games in that time before. [But] we've never set up studios in that time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> That is true. Where this comes from is, first of all, a shared love of racing and a shared love of Star Wars. But when there's a new studio, new team, new tech, new creative... every time there's new, you've got an element of risk. So when we're thinking about it at studio level going, 'well, okay, well how do you mitigate some of those risks?' We can mitigate tech risk by using Unreal or technologies that exist. We can mitigate people risk by working with some folks that we already know and we can mitigate some creative risk by playing in some things that we already know. So I guess it's a mixture of those two, but the more you think about it, you then say, 'okay, why hasn't there been a Star Wars racing game for so long?'</p><p>"We always play to our strengths..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, I mean obviously we kicked around a bunch of concepts because that's good game making. You want to think about what you're doing. We always play to our strengths. We've got a certain sensibilities of how we like to make games. I'm sure if you've played any of what we've worked on that DNA is going to be present here, as it is in everything we do. And that's one of the things that the studio is based, that mutual understanding and long history of shared love for certain types of mechanics and experiences around thrilling, fast arcade racing games. [And then there was that] shared love for the Star Wars universe... we were like, 'oh my gosh, imagine all the things that we love but actually transferred into there as well as the heritage of the movies with podracing or all the racing experiences in there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, when you put that together, it was fairly obvious that was probably going to be the best game we could make for our first game. It would just be the best game that we could make full stop. And then we took that to our partners in Lucasfilm, because we worked with them before, we know them, so we could say, 'Hey guys, what do you think of this thing?' And they basically said the same thing back to us where they were like, 'yeah, we are really excited about this stuff. We love that stuff that you doing. That absolutely makes sense for us.' And as soon as you have that kind of mutual excitement, it's like, we've got to make this happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It sounds like there was a sort of mutual appreciation there from Lucasfilm. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Well, we've got a shared history. I think our first [time on Star Wars was] when we were at Criterion, I remember the folks at DICE were like, 'we think it's an impossible mission, but if anyone can do it, you can,' and it was speeder bikes through Endor, just that fantasy. We've all got it in our heads. And so we just approached that as we would do delivering on any fantasies. Our previous fantasies used to be sports car fantasies. Well, the best way around the corner for me was always all four wheels smoking and sideways with a big smile on your face. We work on those levels, and as Kieran was saying earlier, there's that shared appreciation of the type of experience we want to do, but that history just means something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then through to the [Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One] X-Wing VR mission [a free VR add-on to Star Wars Battlefront], which was one of our most favorite things to do and was really wonderful. There's clearly an appreciation of the work and that goes a long way. So I think there's the meeting of those two things together, people with an understanding of how both sides work, a mutual respect of one another and a desire to go and execute on something that looks like a wonderful opportunity. It's a  great starting point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned a question there that I'd love to ask back to you, which is: why hasn't there been a Star Wars racer in so long? Is it that you guys weren't free, you were busy making Battlefield? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Maybe! I dunno, the obvious answers are only obvious once they exist, I suppose. For us at least, there's that thing of 'can we make a Star Wars racing game?' And then there's the 'okay, well what should we do?' Because I think we wanted to do things a little differently or we wanted to do something different, and that extends to what you are racing. Some of the mechanics inside racing we want to bring some fresh life into, as well as it being a Star Wars racing experience. I can't answer the question of how come no one else has thought about it? Maybe it's a question of timing. But once we had that, it was like, 'okay, how can we do something different with racing and Star Wars?' </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, it's funny. I see it more like the time was right now rather than the time was wrong before. You're right we were on other projects, we were talking about other things and I'm sure there were other teams working other things, but it's that weird thing of both luck and timing. Whenever you make a video game, it's a mixture of so many elements. It's a little bit hard to get the lightning in the bottle, but when we did this brief and we got this together, we were like, 'this is the perfect time to make this thing.' And I believe we're the perfect studio to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned wanting to do things in a Star Wars racer that haven't been done before. We got a look at gameplay last week but what more can you say about what you are doing, and also how people familiar with your past work might feel that DNA in this? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Well, you'll be the best judge of that. It should come through immediately what we're aiming for here in terms of the experience, [addressing] that in some ways HD players have been a little bit underserved by just some kickass track racing experiences. We love those types of games. We love making them, we love playing them, but we wanted to bring a modern view on what that experience could be. You touched on it a little bit earlier about open world, but we wanted to actually come back to tracks. There's a lot of great stuff about tracks in that I replay, my mastery of a circuit comes from replayability, and we definitely are leaning into that from a game structure perspective. That recognition and the repetition and the familiarity of racing circuits,  gets you outside some of the compromises you might make when you do an open world racing game. We knew we wanted to come back into delivering that type of experience for a modern player at 4K 60 with just really super strong visuals in a galaxy far, far away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But like I said, we want to do things differently. So how can we breed some innovation in racing? We're doing that in a couple of ways we can touch into. One is the mechanical boost system. Boost has been in and around racing games forever. Press the button, go fast, consume the boost, and you've got a sort of a tactical decision-making going on there. But we wanted to do something more. So we have a two-phase boost system. The second phase is something called a ramjet, which just goes really, really, really fast, but it's got a consequence too — it generates a load of heat, and if run it for too long, you're going to explode. So you've got consequence there. You've got a second phase of tactical decision making going on. And more importantly, it ties into Star Wars locations. So when we think about where we race in Star Wars, the locations are characters in amongst themselves. </p><p>"So we have a two-phase boost system..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know them by name — Hoth, Endor, Jakku, Tatooine — and we really wanted to bring that in as an integral part of the game. So the environment has a tactical part to play in terms of your racing, and it plays its part in the ramjet. So in Lantaana — a lush, tropical rainforest vibe on an active volcano island planet — we've got rivers of lava and rivers of water, hot and cold. And so you have those decisions — the environmental heat helps get my ramjet up to operating temperature, but it's obviously going to get it hotter, quicker. I can also cool the ramjet, running it for longer over the colder water. And that's just a little example of a mechanical change that we're getting people thinking differently about [as they're making] their racing line choices at a second to second level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, this is probably the first game we've made where the racing line can be that variable depending on the vehicle you're driving, the kind of build you've got within that vehicle, and the environment. This is a game where there isn't just one racing line, there's the one for your current situation, which means every time you attend the galactic tour it's a different experience and a different set of things that you're thinking about. There's quite a lot there and we're not talking about all of it now, but high level, we want to make an arcade racing experience that's richer than it's ever been before with more options and more things to do than ever before. I really think we've got some interesting stuff in this game that I've certainly never done in a video game, and I don't think I've seen it in other racing games either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> While not losing that essence of delivering a racing pilot fantasy from second one, [where you] pick up the path, have a great time, but because you'll know from our past and the way we go about engineering things, you've got a pretty high skill ceiling there for players that really want to drive for mastery so we can support a really broad range of play motivations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've given some great reasons for this to be a track racer, but I wanted to get your thoughts on open world racing, which you've got a lot of history with too. It was really interesting to see the debate about it going on last year — sparked by Mario Kart World, which obviously is a very different kind of racer — but I saw a lot of people come out and suggest there was a nostalgia for a track-based experience. Have you noticed that too? Did it help you feel more emboldened with your approach?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] I didn't notice that, but I would say this... I did play all those games and felt all those things. I absolutely love making open world racers. I've made a bunch, there's plenty more in me, I look forward to doing some of those at some point. I absolutely love track based races, some of my favorite early games are track based racers, and I think there's wonderful experiences to be had there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Has open world reached a point where it's just been done a lot?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins: </strong>I don't think it's as simple as that overall. I think there's great fun, innovation and things to do in both of those spaces. And I certainly, if I go to design a game or picture a game, I'm going to pick the version that does the thing that we want the best rather than I want this one or I want this one. In this game we really wanted something that was really replayable, something that really had that great replay loop, something that every time you replayed it, you felt like you got something new out of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is weird, I can't remember who wrote it but there was an article about 'why aren't racing games like shooters, why is the innovation different?' I think it's because racers, you just need more stuff to do in the race in the second-to-second. We talked about the tactical layer of the ramjet system and how that works with the boost, but I think that goes across the board with the whole genre. It used to be a very, very innovative genre, but it's hard to push innovation in a space where your cognitive load is fairly small because you're in a kind of dynamic system of where you're moving around. Getting that right is a lot harder than other games. I just like to see really, really great experiences that really tighten focus. Then that's what we want to make here. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Games That Never Were</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason we're a track-based racer is because we wanted to have that replayability loop that expands over time. All those benefits people learn in the tracks, the more they play, learning the handling, that familiarity getting them better rather than just a massive smorgasbord of a thing, which is a slightly different kind of 'play with the toys' experience. This is high consequence, high action, high replayability and something that creates player stories that you wouldn't have seen in other games. And I don't think we could do that if we would go in and say, okay, we're also going to do this open world thing. That's a whole set of different challenges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> You're right, and you can also say, well, this is the Galactic League, right? This is sport, and we've seen racing as an activity and as a sport in Star Wars has been around in many forms, right? Episode 1's podracing we all know and love, Bad Batch's riot racing in Season 2 was just awesome. Star Wars Resistance has got the Aces and low-altitude starfighter racing. Racing as a sport and activity is something that's inside Star Wars, and tracks lend themselves to that really well at an action level. And the other thing we realize more broadly is we are inside Star Wars. And Star Wars fans crave the characters and a story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we wanted to go there as well, in a way that frames the racing action. So, you play as a character who is racing, as opposed to it being a racing game. We've made plenty of racing games where you're just a faceless silhouette in a car. Now you're inhabiting Shade, you're a canonical new Star Wars character. You walk down one of the shots in the trailer, you're walking down the ramp of your starship, you're going into a paddock. And this is really interesting addition here where the paddock gives us a place, a low intensity space where we can get up close with our Star Wars stuff, we can move a narrative on, we can see characters inside there. It gives us a low intensity space as a counterpoint and a contrast to the super high intensity racing. And I think it's a really important distinction for us now as we call this a racing adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In the trailer, we see Shade interacting with other characters in that area. So to be clear, it's not just a place for cutscenes between races. There is an area where you can walk around rather than drive around and interact with characters.</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> In those spaces, yeah, you can walk around, interact with characters, you can build rivalries, you can upgrade your plethora of skimmers and have some nice character moments as well, because as Matt said, this is the story of the Galactic Racing League and Shade coming to that and to tell that story, we needed some time with the characters as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is funny, I wasn't thinking about it as a key innovation because it's kind of a no-brainer. This is a Star Wars racing game, and we wanted to have a proper single-player mode in there where we could actually tell a story in this world of what this Galactic Racing league is and immerse people in the authentic Star Wars world with both familiar characters and a plethora of new characters as well. We had to have a space where you're able to do that and we're a gameplay first studio, so we didn't want that to be a cut-scene space.</p><p>"We learned making Burnout: you can only spend so long with your eyes on stalks at 200 miles an hour — or in our case, 400 miles an hour"<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've shown podracers, but these things are like seven or eight meters long and they're enormous, but you don't really get that sense of scale unless you are walking around them as a character and looking around at all this beautiful detail that we built into them. That space serves so many purposes for us in terms of as an immersion space, as a lower intensity. We learned while making Burnout: there's only so long you can spend with your eyes on stalks at 200 miles an hour — or in our case, 400 miles an hour. You need a decompressed moment. And the paddock does a brilliant job of allowing us that mechanism for us to do all of those things. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm running out of time, but </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-trailer-confirms-the-return-of-another-phantom-menace-character-sony-state-of-play"><strong>we've now seen Ben Quadinaros and Sebulba</strong></a><strong>. Are there any more familiar faces in there?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> There's going to be a good mix of familiar faces and new characters. Obviously we want to get that mix right, so no matter what kind of Star Wars media you've engaged with, whether it be a movie or game, there's a bunch of familiarity in there when it comes to the space. Otherwise it wouldn't feel like an authentic Star Wars experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you using any kind of season pass model? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> No. This is a premium release, right? We have our campaign and we have arcade mode and we have multiplayer, and it's a self-contained thing. But what we also recognize is that the landscape of Star Wars evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more Star Wars or new Star Wars over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post launch is going to look like, that's not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that's not what we are making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Our mindset right now is a premium release, to try and get an amazing experience out the box. Obviously we wouldn't close the door to doing something later, but that isn't what we are really thinking about right now. We just want it to be the very best game it can be, and we want it to be complete when it comes out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>People have been avidly working out when the game takes place in canon and according to Wookiepedia it's definitely after 5ABY because of the crashed Star Destroyers following the Battle of Jakku. How much are you playing into the established canon? We've already seen Sebulba — and I suppose that was a surprise to me that he'd made it through the events of the trilogy alive. Will we find out exactly when it's set or does that not really matter?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> I don't think it really matters. As you say, you're on Jakku after the events of Return of the Jedi, the galactic civil war is over and that's where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don't think we're ever specific about timeline beyond that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I love Sebulba's beard, I just wanted to say. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Old Bulba!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<figure data-uuid="955cbbc138351"><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/955cbbc138351/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen several ports come our way in the last eight months that would have been nothing more than a pipedream on Switch 1, and it looks like another title that got everyone talking on PS5 back in 2024 might make the jump to the new Nintendo hybrid, too.</p>
<p>We're talking about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, of course, the action-adventure title from Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up. In the developer's latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">financial report</a>, the team discussed what it hopes to see the game achieve in 2026, noting, "We are reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach. This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series".</p>
<p>Now, okay, there's no specific mention of Switch 2 in there, and the platform expansion is merely being <em>reviewed</em> at the moment, but if it's audience reach that Shift Up is after, we struggle to think of a better destination than Nintendo's latest.</p>
<p>"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," the note concludes.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade enjoyed PS5 exclusivity for the best part of a year before the PC version was released in June 2025. With its sequel now in development, it makes sense that the team would want to broaden its reach to attract as big an audience as possible, it just remains to be seen whether Switch 2 or a straight-up Xbox Series port is the way to do it.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more info this year, and will keep you updated with any juicy Switch 2 nuggets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“This Is Not God of War”: Original Creator Doesn’t Know “What the F***” SSM Was Thinking With New 2.5D Sons of Sparta Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-creator-doesnt-know-what-sony-santa-monica-was-thinking-with-sons-of-sparta/</link>
            <guid>1437340</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, after a long period of silence following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">final piece of DLC</a> for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, during Sony's first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> of 2026, we finally got a small update as to what <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> has been working on. Along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">a remake of the original trilogy</a>, we learned that the studio had teamed up with <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong> to deliver a 2.5D game featuring Kratos titled <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong>.</p>



<p>There have been a lot of rumours circulating for years about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-is-reportedly-considered-for-a-multiplatform-release-day-one-on-pc-or-something-more/">upcoming 2.5D God of War game</a>, so its arrival was both surprising and not; surprising because after hearing nothing but rumours for a while, it was fair to wonder if it was even going to come out at all, and also not because we'd heard so much about it for so long.</p>



<p>Now that it was confirmed and shadow-dropped at the same time, we're starting to see plenty of reactions to the new 2.5D action game, one of which comes from <strong>David Jaffe</strong>, best known as one of the original creators behind the God of War franchise. To say that he's not fond of this new game would be an understatement.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God of War Creator REVIEWS Sons Of Sparta!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liEszJCMW-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em><strong>This is not God of War</strong></em>," an exasperated Jaffe says in his first of three videos he's now made on the game, the first of which you can see above. "<em>What were they [Sony Santa Monica] thinking, like what the f*** are they thinking?</em>" he continues, as he explains that he doesn't believe the game to be bad overall, calling it "<em>fine</em>," but adds that what he finds offensive in it is how generic the game is, and how he believes this is not the game that God of War fans would have wanted if you were to pitch them the idea of playing a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game in Sony's long-running franchise.</p>



<p>Jaffe adds that he doesn't believe anyone wants to play as "<em>kids</em>" in a God of War video game. "<em>Nobody wants to kids! We don't want to play as Atreus; we don't want a spin-off as Atreus. Why do you guys keep making games about 15-year-old boys? Leave me alone! Go to Epstein's Island or something, whatever the f*** it is, I don't know what they're doing, but leave me the f*** alone! I want to be Kratos motherf*****!"</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God Of War Sons Of Sparta NOT READY for release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClC7rCietLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though his first video can be described as an emotional rant fueled by only playing one hour of the game, in subsequent videos after playing a little more of Sons of Sparta, he digs further into his problems with it, citing issues of "<em>visual noise</em>" and an overall lack of polish, because while some people might call the probelms he's pointing out to be "<em>minor</em>," for him, not including even these 'minor' issues in the first place is "<em>what it means to make a first-party game</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Jaffe believes players wanted something closer to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-summer-2025-release/">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>,</strong> and <strong>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</strong>. A smooth, ultra-violent, 2.5D action game where players don't play as a younger, prequel-era Kratos, but as the Ghost of Sparta he was before he became the Kratos we know from the Norse-era games. He adds that if you were to "<em>pull God of War</em>," as in remove the well-known IP from the game and present it as a 2.5D action game about a young Spartan, people would not be interested in playing it.</p>



<p>He's also butting up against the studio's shift in priorities to be more driven by storytelling, instead of the action gameplay that drove the original trilogy. </p>



<p>"<em>It [Sons of Sparta] reminds me of a conversation I had with someone that is no longer at Sony Santa Monica, when</em> <em>we were talking about the sequence in God of War Ragnarok that a lot of people complain about, which is where Atreus is going on that long sled, walk, whatever, with that girl he likes and it just goes on and on and on. And I said to this person, 'Why didn't they recognize, didn't focus tests tell them that this was boring and they should maybe cut that or truncate it?'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>And they said to me - and this is one person's opinion, but they would know, they were certainly in the know. They said, 'Sony Santa Monica these days is driven mostly, or primarily, by story</em>.' <em>And I'm like, 'Oh my god.'</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IS Jaffe SALTY About God Of War?!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzruHkjMCfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jaffe also claims that anyone who says he is "<em>salty</em>" is wrong and that his only motive for talking about his displeasure with Sons of Sparta begins and ends with him just not liking the game. A statement that is difficult to take on its face, since Jaffe is primarily a content creator now, and all of these videos about his displeasure with the game are fueling what appears to be his main source of income.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of survival game <em>Icarus </em>have been delayed, developer Grip Studios has announced, but don't worry; it's not a massive delay.</p><p>Back in January, it was announced that <em>Icarus </em>would come to current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-ps5-xbox-series-xs-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="57045ece-8867-4771-8def-2bce853cb5ab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">at the end of this month</a>, but now, Grip Studios has revealed that the game will be delayed until March 26th.</p><p>The reason for the delay is pretty much exactly what you'd expect; in a press release, Grip says it needs more time to "further refine the game's experience on consoles". The developers say they've identified "a few areas that need further refinement", so taking extra time to work on them is "the right decision".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In case you need a reminder, while <em>Icarus </em>was developed by Rocketwerkz on PC, console development and publishing will be handled by Grip Studios, whose name you might know from its support work on games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09ba0fb1-40df-4991-9f55-2f16878ad8e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>.</p><p>News of the delay of <em>Icarus</em>' console release comes a month or so after Dean Hall and Rocketwerkz announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the game's sales skyrocketed</a> during the most recent Steam winter sale, so we can expect that number to increase further once the console versions arrive.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's an open-world survival game in which you and your friends (or just you, if you're the solitary type) must descend onto a planet on which the terraforming process has gone wrong.</p><p>Once there, you can choose either to play in a sandbox-style open world or to complete individual missions, but either way, you'll be exploring your surroundings, building structures to help you stay alive, and hunting local wildlife for resources.</p>
<p><em>Icarus </em>now launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 26th. The game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> as well.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
