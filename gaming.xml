            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Sektori</em> is an old-school twin-stick shooter. Created by a former developer at <em>Returnal</em> studio Housemarque, it puts you in the role of a little ship that blasts through swarms of enemies, and you have to weave through them to get upgrades to help you survive. Often, my runs end after less than a couple minutes, like a retro arcade game. But creator Kimmo Lahtinen brilliantly weaves modern ideas from roguelikes with pulsing visuals and music that make <em>Sektori</em> a mesmerizing experience.</p><p>A key part of what makes <em>Sektori</em> good is how it puts you into a flow state. “<em>Sektori</em> is a place, a form of being, a method of transformation,” reads the description of the game’s campaign mode. “<em>Sektori</em> is seeking, processing, shaping. <em>Sektori</em> is a specter of your zero state.” It may be fancy, high-concept language, but bear with me as I detail how the game actually works. It took me a while to understand it, and how everything connects is what makes the game actually reach those lofty heights.</p><p>When you start a campaign mode run, your tiny ship is dropped into a small playing field. You initially have two ways to attack: a gun that fires infinite laser bullets in the direction you point your right stick and a “strike” that surges your ship forward but has a short cooldown. Enemies are mostly polygonal shapes that briefly appear as red outlines, giving you a moment to get out of the way before they solidify and become threats. If you take a hit, you lose one of the three shields that you start with. When you destroy enemies, they leave little triangles called “glimmer,” and if you collect enough, you can pick up upgrades.</p><p>The upgrade system is the game’s secret sauce. On the left side of the screen, you’ll see a list of upgrades covering speed, score, strike, shield, missile, and blaster. When you pick up a selector token, it moves the potential upgrade up one notch on the list, but when you actually pick an upgrade, it starts the selector from the beginning again. So, for example, if you pick up enough selector tokens to get a missile upgrade, the next selector token you get afterward will make you eligible for a speed upgrade.</p><p>The system means you’re constantly having to make decisions, often while surrounded by enemies, about whether you want to take a more easily attainable speed or strike upgrade or hold out for the more valuable improvements higher up the stack. Complicating things further is that you can only use selector tokens to get five extra shields total during a run, so you’ll often have to weigh if you want to pick up a shield or gamble on staying alive to grab a missile or blaster upgrade that could help more offensively.</p><p>Occasionally, you’ll come across “evolver tokens” that give you other, more substantial upgrades you can pick from a deck, like drones that fly around your ship or a gun that fires behind you. Every once in a while, you’ll also see a token with a rotating set of letters, and if you pick up all of the letters to spell a word (the harder the difficulty, the longer the word), you’ll enter a brief, rainbow-filled superpowered state that’s kind of like getting a star in <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><p>Complicating things even further is the fact that the arena is constantly shifting and changing around you. Every few seconds, the map grows, shrinks, and sometimes even briefly blocks you off from previously accessible areas. If you’re in an area that gets cut off the map when it’s removed, which is marked by flashing red spots ahead of its disappearance, it’s an instant game over. Survive for long enough, and the arena shifts into a boss battle, such as a giant, <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Moldorm_(Boss)">Moldorm-like</a> snake, and if you beat the boss, you’ll move on to the next, harder level. Survive for five levels and you’ll win the run.</p><p>It can be a lot to manage. Most of my runs never get off the ground because I can’t get upgrades fast enough to survive the onslaught of enemies. Even with a strong build, success feels like it hangs on a knife’s edge. But that’s what makes the game gripping; when a run gets going, <em>Sektori</em> turns into something special as you zip across levels, blast away enemies, keep chasing upgrades, and, against the onslaught, keep surviving — all while colorful graphics and the driving techno soundtrack overload your senses.</p><p>I’ve only beaten the game a single time. But during that one magical run, I finally understood what <em>Sektori</em> is all about.</p><p><sup>Sektori<em> is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/840324/sektori-review-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161146/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Warhammer</a>, I have to say, is something that I've only come to really appreciate properly in recent times. I was never particularly bothered until I picked up a big starter pack of wee guys and big monsters to paint (y'know, for my kids), and then a proper, no-holds-barred addiction set in.</p>
<p>I needed lore. I needed more! And so video games, as ever, have ended up being a very important part in my journey, and this time it's a journey towards a deep understanding of Warhammer. Something like that. Anyway, in short, I've been banging through your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer Boltguns</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Mechanicuses</a> (Mechanici?) in order to get myself all up to pub-chat levels of knowing stuff about the franchise. Breezily japing with the lads over a bevvy without sweating being found out. That's the goal.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, recent times have brought us a swathe of what I'm gonna go ahead and proclaim as the best Warhammer video games we've ever had. The licence is being wielded wisely, and the likes of the aforementioned Mechanicus and Boltgun on Switch, alongside the mighty <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine 2</a> on other platforms, have gifted fans of all things space murder a blood-soaked smorgasbord of shotguns and shot wrong'uns. Again, something like that.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161140/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>"Stop rambling and get on with the review, Grimgor, we don't all have hundreds, or possibly even thousands, of years to spend chit-chatting!" (Check out that pub-level knowledge, amirite folks?). So, now, we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> arriving on Switch 2, and this is another one of the games that I've dug into (on another platform, for shame) over the past year or so in order to sate my big Warhammer appetite. And it's excellent. Let's just get that out of the way. I'm already a big fan of this one before booting into its Switch 2 port, so all they need to do here — all they <em>need</em> to do to stroll to an easy victory — is dish out the goods in working order and we're all in for a treat.</p>
<p>Before we get into the performance, though (as if you can't see that score), let's first get into what's involved in Owlcat Games' epic — you're looking at well over 100 hours here, chief — isometric adventure. Rogue Trader (not be confused with the terrible Ewan McGregor movie) sees you dive into intergalactic battle in the Koronus Expanse, as anyone with pub-level Warhammer knowledge will know is a very dangerous place indeed.</p>
<p>Taking control of a party of six combat units, and in keeping with the original TTRPG, the game thrusts you into strategic, turn-based combat whilst peppering the action with big dialogue choices and player-driven decisions that feed into a unique "Realm Building" mechanic. This sees the world affected by the path you choose to forge, and it's this mechanic that really ties together and elevates a game that also delivers the goods in terms of its strategic scraps and worldbuilding. It's a very solid package indeed.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161150/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>If you've played the likes of Mechanicus (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">which is another banger by the way</a>), you'll sort of know the drill. The Warhammer universe suits this sort of video game down to the ground, and as usual there's depth to spare in the combat skirmishes, tons of replayability built into its ever-changing narrative, and loads of fun to be had in co-op modes - and even a bit of ship-to-ship combat.</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to go on and on and really gild this lily big time, whilst telling you how this Switch 2 port's slick performance helps bring all of this cleverness to life and make it pop, but unfortunately as things currently stand, there's no real point. Indeed, I have to say, this is one of the worst-performing things I've played on Switch 2 so far. Emperor's bowels, indeed.</p>
<p>From the moment you boot into Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader on Nintendo's console, you can tell you're in for a very bad time. The first swooping camera shot of the entire thing, as the game settles down upon your player character and another NPC, stutters and strains as it circles a big tower that's very obviously had all of the graphical spit and polish removed from it. A big visual downgrade, and one that chugs and splutters along, easily down into sub-20fps territory, whilst also crashing consistently, taking an absolute age to load between scenes, and having you stumble about in unresponsive menus. It's not good.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161143/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The combat excels in its brutality, with opportunistic attacks which make for devilishly fluid face-offs that can turn on a dime, but it's derailed thanks to controls that are ruined by the frame rate. It's genuinely hard to place the movement cursor where you want it at times.</p>
<p>So, instead of having a great time (and it's easily a great, if not excellent game when working well) building our own rogue trader's empire, exploring space, and interfering in the fates of planets, we're left in a situation where I think it's best nobody be tempted to buy this thing until it's been fixed up. Until you can shotgun the face off an enemy with nary a stutter.</p>
<p>It's very frustrating. The combat is so crunchy and brutal and full of strategy, it really is some fine stuff, and there's cunning required on anything but the lower difficulty settings to best some ferocious and wonderfully well-designed foes. The narrative is also solid overall, especially given the genre (I shan't spoil in the hopes we get a magical patch in the future), and the decisions and dialogue tree aspects all come off really well thanks to some top writing and perfectly gruff voice-acting. Replayabilty is built in here, and it's one of those things that portable play makes sing, absolutely.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161145/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Gosh, I so want to give this game the score it deserves! However, it's a big-time swerve. I should also note that, whilst I had zero issues with this game on a high-powered PC, I am aware that it does run like trash on Steam Deck, so perhaps this is something worth noting. We shall need to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, though, a wildly vacillating frame rate, unstable resolution, hugely downgraded visuals, unresponsive and sluggish controls and menus, and multiple crashes to the Switch home screen put this one far beyond a recommendation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a cracking bit of turn-based Warhammer action that delivers big on strategic and atmospheric combat whilst also serving you a top-notch, choice-driven narrative and campaign. Hooray. However! This Switch 2 port, at release, is a borderline disaster, and not something I recommend anyone pick up until it's had some patching done.</p>
<p>A constantly stuttering frame rate, long loading times, unresponsive and laggy menus and controls, a huge graphical downgrade, and hard crashes aplenty make for a mess of a port. Let's hope they fix it up, because for now, it's a hard pass for a great game.</p></section>

<p>"Adding support for two new languages"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="b91f86b373321"><a title="Mega Man 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b91f86b373321/mega-man-11.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been a huge week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a>, with Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">revealing a brand-new entry</a> in the series will be coming to the Switch, Switch 2 and other platforms in 2027.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Capcom has another announcement to share about Blue Bomber. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_11">Mega Man 11</a>, which was released on the Switch in 2018 (<em>that's</em> <em>seven years ago!</em>), has received a new update. It adds support for two new languages to the game: Latam Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>Players will be able to swap languages from the options page under the Language Settings. Here's the official announcement:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hsqlmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>This has already led to some fans on social media requesting more updates for this particular entry – including calls for a resolution and performance upgrade on the Switch 2. Capcom hasn't said anything about additional updates for Mega Man 11 in the future, and this update was out of the blue.</p>
<p>If you haven't already played Mega Man 11, there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/capcom-game-awards-switch-and-switch-2-eshop-deals-save-up-to-85percent">currently a sale for the game</a> taking place on the eShop (reducing it to £3.74 / $4.49), and you can also download a demo. In our review here on Nintendo Life, we gave this title nine out of ten stars, calling it a glorious return for one of gaming's greatest heroes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mega Man 11 is an excellent resurgence for the Blue Bomber, imbuing the tried-and-true classic gameplay with modern touches and new ideas that expand on existing concepts in interesting ways. The underlying action platforming gameplay is just as tight and challenging as you remember, and when combined with the new visuals and extra options for replayability, you’ve got a game that’s every bit as good as those that came before, while surpassing them in some ways."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why are gamers hoping Highguard will be dead on arrival?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><span>Closing out this year’s ceremony, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a> gave us our first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/">Highguard</a>, an upcoming PvP shooter launching early next year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in the time since its big reveal, online discourse surrounding Highguard has quickly turned sour, with the announcement trailer receiving a 10:1 dislike ratio and plastered with disparaging comments. But why has the backlash been so strong and is it at all justified?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>As far as final reveals go at The Game Awards, Highguard’s debut wasn’t the mic drop moment it was hyped up to be. The short two-and-a-half teaser, while flashy, did little to support the claims being made that this is a truly new breed of online shooter. Even as someone who is excited to get some hands-on time with Highguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">and one of the few people who enjoyed Concord</a> – we had already seen more eye-popping reveals earlier in the show. Highguard didn’t fit the normal template we’ve become accustomed to. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Fate of the Old Republic</a> might have been a better closer, dropping a vague cinematic announcement despite being years off from release.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Highguard may have received an almighty signal boost thanks to The Game Awards but how many will tune in to play a new hero shooter with MOBA elements in 2026? The biggest problem for new developer Wildlight Entertainment is the ongoing fatigue surrounding the subgenre which, at its peak, unceremoniously eliminated Sony’s big budget contender, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>It’s not all doom and gloom for online shooters, of course. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> managed to pull it out of the bag for Embark Studios despite the PvP extraction subgenre also showing its age. As long as a game can meaningfully iterate on an existing formula – or appear different enough from its competitors – it has a fighting chance.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why some of the knee-jerk negativity surrounding Highguard seems premature. The presence of mounts suggests there will be large maps, with Wildlight labelling the game as a “raid shooter”, meaning that it won’t ascribe to traditional game modes as seen in Overwatch. As for the visuals, which have been called generic and uninspired by online commenters, we can’t help but feel sorry for the art team. Anything particularly toonish or stylised would immediately get called out as derivative and, while some of the character designs don’t scream out to me, I like Highguard’s gunslinging/fantasy vibe.</span></p>

<p><span>Ultimately, we’ve yet to see the game in action, and we’re always willing to see what a new studio can come up with, especially one helmed by Titanfall and Apex legends veterans. The negative response to Highguard hints at a growing problem in the industry, where commentators are quick to form narratives about a game’s success without ever playing it for themselves. These are the same people who will be desperately watching Steam stats when Highguard launches, salivating at a chance to publish a “dead on arrival” takedown of the game they’ve already got saved in their drafts.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if Highguard doesn’t live up to the scorching hype levels stoked by The Game Awards, we need to give developers a chance, even if they are iterating on concepts and ideas that feel done to death.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Arguably, the biggest surprise at The Game Awards 2025 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. Leaker Kurakasis had mentioned that there would be a Star Wars game whose title ended with 'Old Republic', but everyone thought it would be a new look at the Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>Instead, viewers were treated to the unveiling of a brand new project, spearheaded by Casey Hudson, the Game Director and Producer of the original KOTOR (as well as Game Director of the Mass Effect trilogy). Hudson founded a new developer called Arcanaut Studios, headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, with additional offices in Kelowna, British Columbia.</p>



<p>The fact is, the studio's foundation was relatively recent, having been officially dated to July 2025. This makes sense, given that Hudson had previously been busy with another studio, Humanoid Origin, which he <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-trilogy-directors-aaa-sci-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded years ago</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down in late 2024 due to a lack of funding</a>.</p>



<p>This realization chilled a bit of the excitement surrounding Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic as players realized it would take a long time before they could play it. It didn't help that other <span>major Star Wars game projects, such as the KOTOR remake and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank">Quantic Dream's Star</a></span> Wars: Eclipse, suffered a similar fate: being announced way too early. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier compounded those fears in a message <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on the social network Bluesky</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last night's biggest surprise was Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, led by Casey Hudson, who directed KOTOR (and Anthem). Exciting news for lots of people… but Lucasfilm says the studio was founded this year, which means that 2030 is an optimistic guess. Maybe it'll be a PlayStation 7 game.</em></p>



<p>Schreier's guess was indeed solid on the surface, since the average development timeframe for a triple-A game is five years at the least. However, Casey Hudson himself later <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed in on the release window</a>, telling fans to discard the 2030 rumors as the game would launch before that year.</p>



<p>Given the source, we have to trust that there is indeed a plan to get the game out in four years at the most. Is that even possible, though? Sure, depending on a couple of factors. The first is the game's scope. While the details are scant at this point (other than the project's status as a spiritual successor to KOTOR rather than a direct sequel), Arcanaut and Lucasfilm explicitly said this will be a 'narrative-driven' action RPG. </p>



<p>In current developer lingo, this definition usually suggests a tight, story-focused experience that won't feature expansive open worlds with plenty of side content and activities. In short, don't expect to be roaming vast regions of Tattooine or Coruscant or Hoth or what have you as you solve problems for fairly inconsequential citizens of the galaxy. Instead, as Hudson noted <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his interview with the official Star Wars website</a>, the developers will focus on delivering a 'powerful, cinematic adventure driven by player agency, narrative depth, and immersive world-building'.</p>



<p>This isn't so different from the original Knights of the Old Republic game, which was relatively linear and only included around seven and a half hours of side content, according to the average playthroughs listed <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/9111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by HowLongToBeat.com</a>. With this in mind, it would not be impossible to see Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic launch at some point in 2029. Another potential accelerator could be the use of AI during development, which might certainly cut down development times if used effectively. However, it may not be well-received by some fans.</p>



<p>Even so, we have at least a few years to wait before we can play this title. Thankfully, a recent report <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the KOTOR remake is still alive and being worked on at Mad Head Games. Fingers crossed, but it should certainly launch before 2029, if all goes well. The same goes for Eclipse.</p>



<p>To round up the slate of upcoming games set in the faraway galaxy created by George Lucas, Respawn is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making the third and final entry in the Star Wars: Jedi series</a>. The second game launched in April 2023, so we might be looking at late 2027 or early 2028 for the next installment.</p>



<p>Star Wars fans will have two new games to play next year, anyway: the newly announced arcade racing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galactic Racer</a> and the turn-based tactics game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Company</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Director Says Game Will Release Before 2030]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1382452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic Director, Casey Hudson, has hit back on the rumors and speculation that his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will not release until at least 2030</a>.</p>







<p>Speaking on X, Hudson said, “Don’t worry about the “not till 2030” rumors. Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p>



<p>Of course, the post was met with a lot of optimism from players, with some jokingly saying it means the game is confirmed to launch in November – December 2029.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-4-years-of-development-doable">Is 4 Years of Development Doable?</h2>



<p>One of the most serious questions asked after Hudson’s tweet was whether a four-year development cycle is even feasible in this day and age—Afterall, Hudson’s studio, Arcanaut Studios, only formed in the summer of this year. </p>



<p><strong>MORE GAME AWARDS:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025—Everything Announced</a></strong></p>



<p>Typically, AAA games of Star Wars: The Old Republic’s magnitude would usually take between 6 and 8 years of development. This includes the conceptualization and research of the project, which can take a couple of years. It’s possible, given Hudson’s previous work, that the game could already be good to go in terms of what it will be, and the only thing needed is the talent to make it. </p>







<p>Regardless, Hudson’s denial of the rumors in the grand scheme of things squashes negative talk of the game, and even if the game does end up releasing in 2030 and beyond, by that point… Who really cares?</p>



<div><p>On the game’s announcement, Aranaut said on the game,</p><p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness</strong>.”</p></div>

            <p>One of the most headline-grabbing things about science-fiction role-playing game Exodus, beyond it looking a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, is that it stars Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role. He plays the role of C.C. Orlev in the game, a character still shrouded in some mystery, and you can hear his voice narrating the new trailer for the games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice">But McConaughey recently made headlines by signing a deal that will allow his voice to be AI-generated</a> in certain situations by the company Elevenlabs, which he also invested in. Which begs the question: is it really McConaughey in Exodus or has his voice been AI-generated?</p>

<p>"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," Chad Robertson, co-founder of Exodus developer Archetype, told me in an interview. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.</p><p>"The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific. But my point in this is there's a lot more stuff that's going to evolve that way. So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games. And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that"</em></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I asked Robertson specifically whether generative AI was used in Exodus' development at all and it's not. "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it," he said, "but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan.</p>
<p>"We, as creators, have a ton of respect for art in general. And don't you know it's a hot topic with our team when it's come up - it consumes some of our team meetings every Friday. So our team is super passionate about it. But there's an evolution happening in the industry where I think it's going to become more prevalent and become something that everybody's facing."</p><p>Archetype unveiled a new trailer for Exodus during The Game Awards, giving us another montaged look at the sci-fi adventure in which we'll try to escape a tech-related plague by assembling a ship and crew of our own. In the game, we'll play as hero Jun Aslan, a seemingly regular person who happens to be compatible with ancient and powerful tech they'll find through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">Exodus is a game that looks and sounds like Mass Effect, including in how it has some "thirsty" companion romances</a>, and it's made by many former BioWare developers, including the lead writer of Mass Effect 1 and 2, Drew Karpyshyn. Chad Robertson also hails from BioWare.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities, however, there are some key differences, including most notably time dilation. The nearer to the speed of light you travel at, the more time will pass, allowing you to see first-hand the long-term consequences of your actions. I'll write more about this next week.</p>

<p>With prices ranging from $169.95 to $299.95, the keyboards feature key art from the Sonic franchise, including the Blue Blur himself, Shadow, an 'Escape from the City' theme, and a more retro-style approach.</p>
<p>The Dreamcast model is the most luxury of the bunch, sporting a slick, minimal design and new Dampening Plus technology, with layers that mute everything but the keystroke and provide extra stability.</p>
<p>You can also utilise the Higround Forge browser app to completely customise lighting and keybinds, with profiles and settings stored on the keyboard hardware.</p>
<p>So let's take a closer look at each model...</p>

            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has told Eurogamer there's one super-rare game-state that no player has unlocked or achieved yet - something it knows because it has back-end statistics that track these things.</p>
<p>It's to do with a statistic that reflects how you played as Robert, the main character, which is given at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<p>"At the end of the game, we did a little personality test thing, where it's like, 'your Robert was an everyman', based on how you played the game. Or 'your Robert was an anti-hero'," studio co-founder Nick Herman told me.</p>
<p>"There's actually... I've only seen three show up, and there's four. We know the fourth one is actually really hard to get, intentionally. That's just a piece of content I have never seen, and we have stats on the back-end that show that maybe no one's ever gotten it.</p><p>"It's based on gameplay performance," Herman added. "Have you perfected the game, essentially, is what that is. I don't know that anyone's done that." And it's based on perfecting non-randomly generated outcomes in the game, by the way. "We focused it on the non-RNG elements," said Herman.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, there's a catch. There is a chance that someone <em>has</em> played Dispatch in such a way that they should earn this elusive game-state, or response, but it simply isn't registering their efforts correctly. "It might just be a bug," Herman said, casually. "It's so hard to do regardless that we were like, 'Well of course no one's gotten it,' but it's probably a bug."</p>
<p>"We have a permutation that you have not seen because you're not allowed to see it because we broke it," added fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette, the writer of the game, laughing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">Dispatch, a superhero workplace comedy, raced to 2m sales earlier this year</a>, proving that an appetite for Telltale-like episodic series was still very much there. Attention now turns to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">a possible Dispatch sequel, or second series</a>; to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">potential reinstated sex scenes</a>; and to The Game Awards this week, in which Dispatch is nominated for Best Debut Indie Game. These are all things I spoke to Herman and Shorette about at much greater length. Look out for a fuller interview soon.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Oh gosh, there is so much that I want to play and so little time to play it! Despite having a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> so far, I'm still only a couple of hours into it. I'm hoping to remedy that this weekend, but I'd also like to check out the Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC, and finally wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which leaves time for... not much else.</p>
<p>Hey ho, back to the sofa we go!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>As is customary in the race to catch up with the year's games, I've distracted myself with something from eons ago that has zero relevance to 2025 GOTY discussions. The kids saw the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a> icon on my Switch menu, and that was that. Helluva game, and its compulsive mix of simple goals, absurdity, and awesome audio has been a salve in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm still playing the brilliant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simogo_legacy_collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (which managed to haul me from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>) and I'm enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Okay, so how much did Leon’s gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> look like a cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>?! Wild. So of course that means I’m playing more RE this weekend. Specifically… yes, 4 and 6. Leon’s back baby, and I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<p>I do, however, think it’s about time I actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> properly. It’s been sitting on my home screen since launch and I’ve played the tutorial battle about 10 times before something else comes along and distracts me. Maybe I need to stop playing so much Resident Evil…<br>

<p>By the time you’re reading this, I will have completed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and that is my GOTY 2025. I will be feeling a great emptiness in my life, that joy of experiencing a great work for the first time forever gone, the eagerness to see what comes next, find a new upgrade, fight a new boss and conclude Samus' and her fellow stranded Federation soldiers' ordeal (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a> sequel when?). More time to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>'s proper ending and return to the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>.</p>
<p>My game of the week is the much-delayed, much sublime Terminator 2D: No Fate. Bitmap Bureau took on a tall order by grabbing a franchise that is held dear in the hearts of gamers of my generation, but seems to have pulled it off. While <strong>Terminator 2</strong> is one of the finest movie sequels ever produced, it never got a 2D platform run’n’gun game it deserved until yesterday. Maybe the future is gonna be OK after all.</p>

<p>This weekend, my mother-in-law has come to stay! What kind of games do mothers of the in-law variety enjoy? Well, I know she likes Mr Bean, because we watched two hours of <strong>Mr Bean</strong> last night. Is there a Mr Bean game? I don't think I want to play it.</p>
<p>I'm still making my way through <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and I just discovered the radio, which is now my favourite thing about the game. And it never tells you about it! Imagine playing <strong>Fallout</strong> without the radio. It would be a very different game. TOW2 has a similar musical vibe, with lots of jazz and swing, except it turns out that it was all commissioned for the game from real jazz and swing bands, with lyrics that reference in-game brands. Yes! All the music is advertising jingles! And it RULES. The lyrics are very funny, especially when you're only half listening as you wander through space and you suddenly catch a line like "Come get your candyyyy (it's tobacco) delicious candyyyy (that's tobacco".</p>
<p>Since it's getting close to Christmas, me and my partner are also considering what our Christmas Time game will be! Right now, he's replaying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> (it's just as good as you remember it being!) but I've also got him the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Collection</a> on Switch, because he expressed interest in wanting to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>. He probably won't read this, so I'm pretty sure it's fine to say that here. But don't tell him, okay?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG Black Budget Alpha—First Impressions and Preview]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON recently pushed out the first closed alpha for PUBG Black Budget, an all-new extraction shooter with some innovative mechanics and an accessible operating model. It’s aiming to disrupt a genre most recently dominated by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders, but does it actually have a chance?</p>



<p>I’m a keen extraction fan (not extractor fan, that’s what lives in your bathroom) and have spent thousands of hours across the genre, so I was all too eager to leap head over heels into PUBG Black Budget, try out the alpha, and feed back my thoughts.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-looking-good">Is PUBG Black Budget Looking Good?</h2>



<p>I’m happy to report that PUBG: Black Budget certainly is looking good. The game is designed to be more of an arcade-like extraction shooter than a borderline milsim title like Escape from Tarkov or Gray Zone Warfare, but it still has plenty of realism. It’s rooted in sci-fi, and players must explore the island of Coli, which is being crushed by the ever-growing anomaly, suffocating the map as the raid goes on.</p>



<p>This means you’re effectively getting a battle royale, extraction shooter hybrid, balancing the best of what PUBG does so well with the growing popularity of the extraction space.</p>



<p>What makes PUBG Black Budget different, though?</p>



<p>I was surprised to learn that a few things are setting PUBG: Black Budget apart from the stock of extraction shooters already on the market.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Budget’s core gameplay loop sees players pick where on the map they infil, giving them some semblance of control over their raid. They can place markers, navigate a dynamic map, and ultimately enjoy a simple, accessible introduction to the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>It’s how ARC Raiders found so much success recently, by being welcoming rather than punishing.</p>



<p>The game’s anomaly mechanic is a welcome addition, as it ensures players need to adapt <strong>very quickly </strong>in some circumstances. The game’s extraction points are dynamic, and they pop up all over the map as the game unravels, but they’re more prevalent in the closing minutes of the round, which encourages you to stay around longer.</p>



<p>What I will say is that the map is <strong>enormous</strong>, especially for an extraction shooter. It’s going to take a very long time to explore it all, especially as the anomaly frequently eats entire portions of it right off the bat.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-anomaly">Enter The Anomaly</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>PUBG: Black Budget is set on an island where a time-loop mechanic is employed. Every raid is different, but you’re effectively launching a skirmish into the same setting on repeat, because of the time-loop feature. You load up, load in, secure objectives, grab loot, kill other players, and get out alive.</p>



<p>That’s the bread and butter of the extraction space, but how PUBG: Black Budget is doing it is what impressed me.</p>



<p>The arcade approach means a wider audience will be attracted to this game right out of the gate. There are neat traversal mechanics, such as ziplines, vaulting, clambering, and so on, and the weapon mechanics and ballistics are about what you’d expect for an arcade-style shooter.</p>



<p>By that, I mean it’s point-and-shoot without worrying too much about intricate calculations.</p>



<p>The looting loop is attractive, and there’s plenty to find, and players are encouraged to explore the game’s more critical mechanics, such as inventory and health management. It’s pretty basic, but that’s what makes PUBG: Black Budget so good. Even the tutorial is masterfully crafted to give you the best introduction possible to the game’s core concepts.</p>



<p>The quality-of-life improvements over other extraction shooters, like proximity looting, uncomplicated healing mechanisms, and a faster pacing, are all top-notch. It’s also kind of a combination piece. The map feels like Gray Zone, the fundamentals feel like Escape from Tarkov, and the accessibility feels like ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>When your raid is over, and you’ve extracted through a submersible or a wormhole, you’ll find yourself in your hideout. This is a dynamic location that can be expanded and upgraded over time, but unlike Escape from Tarkov’s hideout function, it allows the player to pick and choose what they do and where they place upgrades and new benches.</p>



<p>As someone who loves base-building mechanics, this spoke to me quite nicely.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-worth-it">Is PUBG Black Budget Worth It?</h2>



<p>PUBG: Black Budget is in closed alpha as I write this, with a second window set to take place <strong>next weekend</strong>. That means it costs nothing to get involved, but there’s a specific path you need to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-black-budget-alpha-key-for-steam/">to get a Black Budget alpha key</a>.</p>



<p>If PUBG: Black Budget were to be released in the state it’s currently in, I’d certainly invest, but I would either hope it’s free to play, or that it has a price tag not exceeding $30. I would like to stress that there were no AI-based enemies when I played, beyond a little wildlife, and that’s strange for a PvPvE shooter.</p>



<p>The niggling issues aren’t really there, as I had no problems occur when I was playing. All the issues came from getting a key in the first place, and once I did, I was very happy with what I experienced in Black Budget.</p>



<p>With the backing of KRAFTON and the inevitable massive creator campaigns sitting on the horizon, I’m confident that Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> have come and gone and Half-Life 3 was still nowhere to be seen, despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of an imminent official announcement</a>. That was more than enough to send some of the fans who had truly believed into utter despair, but all is not lost.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>, journalist Mike Straw provided an update on the Half-Life 3 situation. According to his sources, Valve is holding back the announcement due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/within-three-months-samsung-ddr5-5600-16-gb-module-price-rose-by-3x-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing RAM pricing issues</a> affecting the PC industry, which will inevitably impact the price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Since the game is supposed to be the big launch title of the new hardware, it doesn't make sense to reveal it until they are ready to go forward with the Steam Machine. The original launch window was <strong>Spring 2026</strong> for both. </p>



<p><em>I wanted to just give an update on things. People have asked. I have been told a date. I wasn't going to report that date because they weren't 100% confident in that date. That date has sailed past. So, there's a reason I didn't report it. Every date from every journalist I've spoken with, every creator who follows it and has dug, every single date that they were told has passed. [...] Now, everything I have, everybody I talked to, is still adamant that Half-Life 3 will be a launch title for the Steam Machine. </em></p>



<p><em>There is a concern, however, that they haven't made a decision on price, which is holding back the announcement of anything else. The reason is because of PC RAM prices. They're up 200%, 300%, 500% of what they were in October, and it's only getting worse. The window that I was told was Spring 2026, for the Steam Machine, for the Steam Frame, for the Steam Controller, for Half-Life 3. [...] At the end of the day, the game is real. There's no denying it. It's just a when and not if at this point. All the signs pointed to it being announced in December. Then everything hit the fan, and I think it was a case of that concern. The Steam Machine was supposed to be Q1, like the end of Q1 2026, but I'm starting to wonder if that hardware's going to be pushed out. </em></p>



<p><em>I can tell you the people I spoke to about this game, they're not these run-of-the-mill sources that haven't gotten me information before. They're the same sources that have given me details on Madden. A couple of them are the same sources that have given me details on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings game that is in development that I reported on</a>. They're not random, like, one-off people, and they're still adamant that Half-Life 3 is coming in the Spring.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the pricing of the Steam Machine has already been a somewhat controversial topic, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following Valve's confirmation that it won't be subsidized like consoles</a>. That is to say, Valve isn't willing to lose money on unit sales to recoup with game sales via Steam and accessory sales, as Microsoft and Sony have done in the past with Xbox and PlayStation consoles. With the aforementioned RAM pricing issue, Valve may be forced to put a hefty price tag on the hardware, potentially hampering its sales from the start. It makes sense that they would rather wait and even delay its launch a bit if necessary.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if you'd like to get a sense of how Half-Life 3 might play once it is finally released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our dedicated article</a>, which includes all datamined information from Source 2 engine updates and more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has almost reached its climax, with the semi-finals promising some of the most intense action of the season thus far. The $1.25 million tournament has already delivered some unforgettable clashes, but the best is yet ot come.</p>



<p>The first semi-final fixture will see Team Spirit face Team Vitality, while the second pits FaZe Clan against Natus Vincere. These stellar match-ups are almost impossible to predict, but that’s just what we’re doing below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on the Budapest semi-finals, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet"></a></figure>











<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>Vitality, led by the legendary ZywOo, remains one of the most consistent forces in Counter-Strike after a stunning season. Team Spirit, surfacing in the opener of the semi-finals, will need to pull off something remarkable to push Vitality out of the tournament, but it’s by no means impossible.</p>



<p>Faze Clan versus Natus Vincere is an interesting fixture. The former team has had a tough run through the tournament thus far, producing a rocky streak that has had many surprised they’ve made it this far. The team recently eliminated MOUZ to get into the semi-finals, and they’re mere steps away from that $500,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>In terms of honest predictions, GG.bet has Vitality in the best spot to win the Major, while Spirit follows close behind. If you’re playing the outright markets, this is a relatively safe route to follow. If you want a bigger return, back FaZe Clan, the outsider at this point in the tournament.</p>



<p>However, my prediction is that we’re looking at a Vitality vs. NAVI grand final, with Vitality taking the trophy this time around.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> who you think will win the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>

The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions include the full game data on the disc, while the Switch 2 edition is a Game Key Card release. These do not contain the game data, and instead act as physical access keys to the digital version. This means that, despite coming in a physical box and cartridge, the full game still needs to be downloaded from the eShop--though you can lend or borrow Game Key Cards just like standard game carts.

Note that the Switch 2 edition is a Game Key-Card release--that means none of the game data is included on the cartridge. Instead, it acts as a physical DRM key that grants you access to the digital version of the game. You'll have to download the game to your Switch 2 before you can start playing. Pragmata will take up an estimated 17GB of storage space on your Switch 2's internal hard drive or microSD Express card.</p><p>Physical preorders are available at Amazon for $60, and we expect more retailers will have the game soon.

While Diana isn't a fighter, she can ride shotgun on Hugh's back and hack them so that their weak points can be exposed. Hugh can then finish them off, using his arsenal of weapons.

<p>Capcom yesterday announced its new sci-fi action adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, starring Hugh and his android companion Diana, would be coming to the Switch 2 in April 2026.</p>
<p>As you might have already heard, this title (where you explore a lunar research station) adds a "unique hacking twist" to gameplay - combining basically puzzle solving, fire fights and more, as you take down robot enemies. To help illustrate what's going on, Capcom has now uploaded a new "hands-on" impressions video, featuring some of its "friends" who explain their own experiences with this new game.</p>
<p>Once again, the demo for Pragmata is available to try out now on Steam, and will be "coming later" to the Switch 2 and other console platforms. Here's a bit about what you can expect when it does arrive on Nintendo's hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay demo, known as Sketchbook, lets you try out the tactile combat system that fully engages both sides of your brain, while you also get to experience what it's like to traverse the lunar research station."</p>
<p>"You might discover new things as you replay the demo! Complete the demo to receive an illustration from Diana and don't forget to share it with #PRAGMATA on your socials."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pre-orders have also gone live in select locations. This title will set you back <strong>$59.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), and there's an amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-capcom-is-bringing-pragmata-to-switch-2-amiibo-and-demo-also-confirmed">Diana on the way</a>. Capcom will also be offering some DLC known as the 'Shelter Variety Pack'. This includes the following items:</p>

		<p>Cast your mind back to the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox One and there was big kerfuffle when certain companies were found to be making CG render trailers of what was meant to be gameplay, and the game usually turned out looking nothing like the renders. These days every game gets announced with a CG trailer and that means you don’t need to have finished the game, or in the case of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, maybe not even coded a single line.</p>
<p>It turns out the new studio that is making the game was formed just this year and given AAA games take at least four or five years to make these days, you probably won’t be seeing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic until the next decade.&nbsp; That is if it ever gets made, Star Wars titles announced at events have a solid track of vanishing in development hell.</p>


<p>Star Wars: 1313 was announced at E3 2012 and was cancelled a year later. Star Wars: Eclipse was announced by Quantic Dream in 2021 and we have not seen a single thing about the game since then. Then we have Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic – Remake which was revealed during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021 with Aspyr developing the title. Since then it seems there have been studio troubles and rumours suggest the entire game was scrapped and now Mad Head Games are on the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> was announced last night at The Game Awards 2025.</p>

<p>“Being set in the past gives us an immense amount of open space to tell new original Star Wars stories, while staying true to the spirit of the galaxy we all love. There are, quite literally, infinite stories to tell. While we will always honor and celebrate the core saga, it’s crucial to explore new territory, meet new characters, and see new parts of the galaxy,” said VP and GM of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Friday evening in Budapest has proven to be chaos incarnate, with two favorites falling out of the StarLadder Major. In two fell swoops, MOUZ and FURIA were eliminated from the running by FaZe Clan and NAVI, respectively. These upsets have blown the Major wide open, and the handful of teams remaining will now prepare for a weekend that will end with a trophy being lifted.</p>



<p>Find out how today’s action unfolded below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoffs-are-electrifying">Budapest Major Playoffs Are Electrifying</h2>



<p>FURIA arrived in top form, but Natus Vincere managed to stay resilient, dismantling the top-tier pick in a three-map thriller. It was the only series thus far in the playoffs bracket to go beyond a two-map sweep, with FURIA at least doing <strong>something </strong>to try and stay in the running.</p>



<p>The fixture gave way to some stunning moments, such as a scenario that unfolded to allow w0nderful to secure a massive quad-kill accolade.</p>



<p>In the MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan space, a two-point sweep that wasn’t even close was all that was needed to eliminate MOUZ from the tournament. The second map, Inferno, was a whitewash, with FaZe producing a staggering 13-2 scoreline and drowning MOUZ out in a short series.</p>



<p>In the post-match coverage, FaZe Clan’s broky was praised for putting up some big numbers.</p>



<p>The bracket goes forward with two huge matches airing tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FaZe Clan</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced a revival of their Saturday morning cartoon TTRPG. The aptly named <em>Toon Second Edition</em> brings back an updated version of the 1984 original with some welcome modern touches, courtesy of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><h2>The <em>Toon Second Edition</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/a5976d11-0069-4119-acf2-4d16a54cf8db/landing" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, <em>Toon Second Edition</em> is all about bringing the exaggerated, cartooonish, antics of classic <em>Looney Tunes</em> to a tabletop scenario. It's a game that runs on cartoon logic. No one dies, no matter how many times they are flattened by falling pianos and anvils; they're just temporarily taken out.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Naturally, the game is easy to learn and perfect for families looking for some old-school cartoon slapstick fun. The original release was notable for its tongue-in-cheek tone, parodying the rules and systems of more "serious" role-playing games on the market, like classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The core design of the game even encouraged players to act with wild abandon, with advice like, "Act Before You Think."</p><p>Essentially, anything you can imagine happening during a <em>Looney Tunes</em> short is possible in Toon. The GM, or Animator, changing the environment to engineer cartoonish comeuppance. Characters breaking the fourth wall for the sake of a gag. All of it is here.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> will include new quality-of-life improvements. This includes simplified character designs, enabling faster play, over a dozen customizable cartoon adventures, and improved Silly Tables. For fans of the original, this new rulebook will feature full-color artwork by the original artist, Kyle Miller.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> is designed by Greg Costikyan (<em>Pax Britannica</em>), developed by Warren Spector (<em>Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Game</em>, <em>The Thing in the Darkness</em>), and revised by Steve Jackson (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-set-2-kickstarter-is-crowdfunding-critical-success" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Fighting Fantasy</em></a>).</p><p>The Backerkit campaign for <em>Toon Second Edition</em> will go live on December 17, 2025. The campaign will provide PDFs, softcover, and hardcover book options.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105</link>
            <guid>1382284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714"><em>Divinity</em></a> was one of the biggest reveals at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a>. Hell, there was an entire demonic statue sitting in the desert for over a week to get people hyped. Actors were paid to sit in the front row of the showcase and get lifted into the air on pulleys to introduce the game’s first trailer. But what is it and why should you care? Here’s the little we know so far about Larian Studios’ next major RPG.</p> <h2><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It’s a new game from Larian Studios, most famous for the acclaimed 2023 hit RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;Like that one, <em>Divinity</em> is also an RPG. Unlike that one, <em>Divinity</em> takes place in Larian’s own made-up fantasy universe instead of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Forgotten Realms. Larian’s land of Rivellon is still inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and so on, though it has some peoples you won’t find in <em>BG3 </em>too, and it still revolves around magic and demonic forces, but there are seven gods and more religious overtones. It started in 2002 with the studio’s first fantasy RPG, <i>Divine Divinity.&nbsp;</i></p>

 <p>“The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.” That’s the tagline for the new <em>Divinity</em>, which Larian promises will be its “most ambitious title yet” and even larger than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">massive statue</a> and a gnarly cinematic trailer that suggests the world of <em>Divinity</em> may be on the verge of succumbing to some truly wicked hellspawn.</p>

  <h2><strong>Wait, is this <em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>No, it ain’t. While fans of that turn-based sub-series would love to see Larian go back to that solid foundation, the company’s head of publishing was very clear that this isn’t a direct sequel. “There aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,” Michael Douse wrote on X <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">prior to <em>Divinity</em>‘s announcement</a>. But Larian did name-check both<em> Original Sin</em> games in its press release, saying fans of those will have a better understanding of this new game’s world.</p>

 <p>Here’s how director Swen Vincke put it in the announcement: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘Divinity.’ We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the <em>Divinity</em> we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.”</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Divinity</em> be turn-based?</h2> <p>That’s one of the great debates raging among fans as <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1999108111789851024"><em>alleged</em> rumors</a> circulate that Divinity&nbsp;<em>might</em> not be turn-based. That would be a big departure from Larian’s last decade of projects which have all been that way. Back in the beginning, however, the <em>Divinity</em> franchise was a real-time action series that played like <em>Diablo</em>. It’s not hard to see Larian going back to that, especially if <em>Divinity</em> is operating on a grander scale than past projects. Maybe it’ll be third-person action more in the vein of modern <em>Dragon Age</em>? Still, the studio has a history of sticking to what works and iterating from there. If I had to bet money, I’d say it’s probably still turn-based.</p>

 <h2>Is that old guy getting <em>Wicker Man’</em>d in the trailer important?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653115"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653115">Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Probably! Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/1pkhj33/they_commited_the_original_sin/">Divinity subreddit</a> have been debating who it might be. One theory is that it’s a character called <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian">Lucian</a> who’s the canonical hero for the original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, eventually getting godly powers and being worshiped. He also adopts a child named <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Damian">Damian</a> who ends up being a vessel for demonic entities. Here’s one fan’s theory:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“The implication of this trailer seems to be that the people of Rivellon stopped worshipping the dead gods and committed, besides the seven deadly sins, the Original Sin of killing the powerless Lucian, which causes the Hellstone to spawn, as the last remnants of the gods and Source were destroyed that way.”</p></blockquote> <p>Much of this interpretation depends on where in the existing timeline the new <em>Divinity</em> takes place. Is it after <em>Original Sin 2</em> or a prequel to the entire franchise? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Whoever is being tortured in the game’s first trailer, it seems clear that all is not well in Rivellon and the demons are coming to take over.</p> <h2>When is <em>Divinity</em> coming out?</h2> <p>There’s no release date yet. Not even a release window or a whisper of one. <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> was made in three years. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> took six. A lot will depend on whether this is the only game Larian has in production or it’s working on something else alongside it. Either way, we probably won’t see it out in the wild until 2027 or beyond.</p> <h2>What platforms will <em>Divinity</em> launch on?</h2> <p>PC seems like a safe bet. Maybe even an Early Access launch like Larian did with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It could be far enough away to be a cross-gen console release on both PlayStation 5 and PS6. Same for Xbox. Hopefully it runs well on PC handhelds and Valve’s Steam Machine. Maybe it’ll even come to Switch 2? Larian’s only other game to launch on a Nintendo platform was <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>.</p>

            <guid>1382281</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> has officially been named Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025, alongside multiple other wins. If that winning sweep has you jumping in for the first time (or returning for another playthrough), IGN has you covered with guides, explainers, and wikis to help you get started for your journey across The Continent.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33? Should You Play It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG (it's kind of like Final Fantasy VII... <em>kind of</em>) set in the world of The Continent. It follows a group called Expedition 33 on a mission to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious figure who wipes out anyone over a certain age in a yearly ceremony called the "Gommage." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside extremely unique turn-based combat, which emphasizes various skills and parries to deal damage to bosses with "tells" and plenty of secret weak points, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Characters"><strong>you and your party</strong></a> explore various different areas, encountering enemies, finding treasure, and discovering what happened to other Expeditions that ventured out to beat the Paintress - and failed - before. You also can also build your team to deal ridiculous combo-based damage, something that hardcore players have come to love about Expedition 33. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan but don't have time to sink 100+ hours into them, Expedition 33 may be <em>perfect</em> for you. If you solely focus on the main story, you can expect to roll credits in around 28 hours. With side quests, this increases to 45 hours. If you're set on completing <em>everything</em>, it'll take roughly 65 hours. And if you want to beat a bunch of optional bosses with crazy builds, you can do that, too. Oh and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">we gave Expedition 33 a great score in our review </a>if you want a more in-depth take!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/23/doesnt-tell-you-site-1745450875713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">How Combat Works in Expedition 33</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features turn-based combat, which means that everyone in battle, including enemies, attacks one at a time, rather than everyone at once - think classic Final Fantasy, Persona, or Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't just wait for enemy attacks to hit you, though. Here, one of the main selling points is the ability to parry, dodge, and jump to avoid and counter attacks. When an opponent uses a move, you're able to press a button that, when timed right, either dodges, jumps, or parries to avoid damage completely or deal damage back to them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/expedition-33-combar-1765568222438.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to your own skills, these are powered by Pictos and Luminas. Pictos are special pieces of equipment that you equip to characters to grant special benefits and increase stats. Luminas, working hand-in-hand with Pictos, are special skills that unlock after you've won a battle with a Picto four times, and can be carried over and used with every member of your party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Builds are a crucial part of combat in Expedition 33, and you'll need to pay mind to not only your Pictos and Luminas, but weapons and attributes.

Because we’re heroes who never turn away a person in need, we agree to help her find this mystery beast, but before we can really start looking, the city is overtaken by mysterious portals that lead to a bizarro version of Lumiose called Hyperspace. In this mirrored universe, we find Pokémon that aren’t native to the city and are more powerful than they’re supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The only way we can face these powerful foes and investigate this odd phenomenon is by Ansha feeding her partner Pokémon Hoopa berry-filled Donuts that allow it to power up our Pokémon as we head into Hyperspace on short expeditions. All of this paves the way for an interesting, albeit slightly underbaked (ironic, considering the whole Donut gimmick) roguelike mode that puts all your battle knowledge to the test.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653108">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t quite introduce a complete mechanical overhaul of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s real-time battle system, but it is far more demanding. Each time you head into Hyperspace, you’re on a timer whose length is determined by the quality of the Donut you make for Hoopa, which also increases your stats and raises your level beyond the typical cap of 100. You only have so much time to complete a few missions to gather intel points, and learning how best to make the most of your limited time can be the difference between a lucrative run or a wasted one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into this mirrored version of Lumiose can last anywhere from a few minutes to almost 10, depending on the recipe Ansha cooks up, all determined by the Berries you bring her. Once you’re in Hyperspace, you’ve gotta make quick choices about what enemies you fight, which objectives you focus on, and the Pokémon you bring and use with you. Even your most powerful monster might waste some of your time because its moves take too long to charge up, and the clock won’t stop ticking as long as the game is unpaused.</span></p>

 <p><span>Getting a hang of the whole system can take some time, especially when the early expeditions you take into Hyperspace give you just a scant few minutes to acclimate yourself to the ways in which you must change how you carry yourself in this hostile new environment. By the time I was making Donuts that gave me more minutes on the clock, I had a strategy in place that I would adapt on the fly. I’d lead with a Pokémon equipped to handle a rift’s assigned element, barrel through the mini-quests I was assigned for that route, then head to high ground to find the Bonus Ball treasure chest that would spawn after I’d completed my tasks. I’d use my Salamence to search for this item, because his flight ability meant he could get to this golden ball from just about anywhere, helping me snag it within whatever precious seconds I had left in a run.</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into Hyperspace made me more aware of some of the weaknesses of my party’s composition. I didn’t trade out Pokémon, but as the time limit ticked down in these sections, I became more aware of how slow my Houndoom’s Dark Pulse charge-up was and the time I could save by swapping it out for a faster Crunch attack. My Raichu is spec’d as a physical attacker, but only one of those attacks can reach targets in the air. By the time I was really trying to min-max every Hyperspace run, I had changed several of my go-to movesets just to accommodate the ever-present threat of being yanked out of Hyperspace. Fast attacks that could reach targets above eye level were more important than heavy-hitting ones that would take precious seconds to cast.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653109">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s roguelike elements are a bit shallow, with your success mostly determined by how far past the level cap you are when you enter Hyperspace, the time limit and focus on verticality do require you to rethink what efficiency looks like in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, and ideally, you think of those things before you head into the imaginary city with level 140 monsters.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble I expect some folks to have with the roguelike half of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is that it is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>huge grind</span></a><span>. I hit the credits at about a dozen hours, and large chunks of that time were spent going in and out of Hyperspace to gather intel for folks back home to research the cause of this phenomenon before it engulfed the entire real city. I don’t mind it personally, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system has always felt more like a puzzle game to me than a grindy RPG. I like seeing a Pokémon in the distance, choosing who in my party can most likely take it out the fastest, and seeing if I can pull it off. The grind started to hit me hardest in the endgame as I tried to capture some of the major Legendary monsters in the DLC, and even as I chip away at some of the post-game stuff, I’m still feeling that. But I still enjoy </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system enough that the grind’s not a detriment for me.</span></p> <p><span>If all </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>had to offer were the roguelike elements, however, I wouldn’t be that hot on it. Thankfully, there’s also a bevy of new quests full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>funny citizens saying silly things</span></a><span>, stories to hear, and monsters to catch. Over 100 returning Pokémon from regions far beyond Kalos appear in Hyperspace, and that includes a ton of new Mega Evolutions as well. As anyone who has paid attention to me yelling about it on </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>for months will know, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>added two Mega Evolutions to my favorite guy, Raichu. I was a mark ready to slap down $30 to finally see my boy get some love, and the X form’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-like fighting style</span></a><span> makes him one of my favorite Mega Evolutions Game Freak has ever put out. But Raichu is just one of several Megas added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, and there are some inspired choices. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s base-game Megas skewed a bit too silly for some folks’ liking, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>definitely tips the scales in the opposite direction with a ton of “cooler” designs. I won’t spoil some of the monsters Game Freak decided to give a new form to, but suffice it to say that I was really eager to see each new form when I finally came to face them.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of those Megas are especially memorable because </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>brings back the best part of the base game with Rogue Mega Evolution battles. These lengthy boss fights against rabid Mega Evolutions are still some of the most entertaining skill checks in probably any </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game, and they’re made all the more challenging because they take place in Hyperspace, thus having a time limit and broken level cap to deal with. These frantic fights are tough, require coordination between your player character and Pokémon, and still find ways to surprise me in how the different Rogue Megas behave.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000653107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653107">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the best things </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>adds is the ability to replay these fights, which wasn’t available in the base game. I’ve had a lot of fun going back to some of those fights with Mega Raichu in my party, so he can actually take them on. One of my biggest problems with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was that its focus on Mega Evolution made its party compositions feel more limited, as it was much more difficult to handle some of these fights without Mega-Evolution-capable critters on your team. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t change that, but at least it gives me a chance to play through these fights again with my favorite guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is tied up in a story that ties together multiple sides of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. Each of this series’ generations has been set in a different region, and as such, they can feel a bit disconnected from one another. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes a point to spotlight multiple sides of its mythology, so it surprisingly feels like a sequel to games you might not expect. Fans of </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>’s Hoenn region will probably get a kick out of how much it factors into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but there’s something here for fans of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>’s Sinnoh legends, as well.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Raichu flies around like he’s Superman, and if you don’t think that’s the tightest shit you’ve ever seen, I don’t know how to help you.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Post-game expansion for Legends: Z-A with more monsters, Megas, and challenges</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Roguelike mode is a new challenge, interesting use of the series’ mythology, Mega Raichu.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>It’s a grind, roguelike elements could be a bit meatier.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~12 hours to credits, still chipping away at post game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>As much as I loved everything </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>gave me, I understand the $30 price tag is a big ask for folks. I try not to weigh in on the price of things in reviews because I don’t know every reader’s financial situation, and it feels disingenuous of me to try to make some sort of judgment call about whether or not something is “worth” a certain amount of money. Mega Raichu sold me on the expansion before I’d even played it, but looking at the DLC in the context of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> long history, it does feel a little bit icky. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s post-game was practically non-existent, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes the post-game one of the most robust in the series, but it’s on top of an already pricey game in a world where video game prices are only getting more expensive.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t make the call for you on whether it’s “worth” the price, but I can tell you that I got a whole lot more of a game I loved and that spoke to the things I enjoy most about this series. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s greatest strengths are in its experimental battle system and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>city-centric storytelling</span></a><span> that makes the most of its merry band of misfits. I got that in spades here, and I got to see it with a Mega Evolution of my favorite Pokémon by my side.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you didn’t already&nbsp; love </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I would be surprised if anything here changed your mind. I’m having a great time, though. Raichu and I aren’t done scavenging every inch of Hyperspace for the Pokémon we haven’t met yet, and if this is the end of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, it’s still going to be one of my favorite games in the series. </span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106]]></content:encoded>
