              <p>The Pixel 10 phones from Google are direct competitors to the iPhone 17 lineup, and they offer great value that makes Apple’s prices look high in comparison. The great news is that there’s an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">unlocked Pixel 10 128GB currently on sale on Amazon for $549, which is $250 less than its $799 list price</a>. Google’s flagship phone comes with Google’s own Tensor G5 chip, a triple rear camera system with 5x optical zoom, and seven years of guaranteed Android updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Built-In Tensor G5 Processing</h2>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip is the newest version of<strong> Google’s custom silicon made for AI processing</strong> and computational photography on devices, not just for getting high benchmark scores. This processor can do complicated machine learning tasks right on your phone, so you can use features like real-time language translation, advanced photo processing, and Gemini AI interactions without having to send data to cloud servers. The architecture focuses on making everyday tasks as efficient as possible while also giving you extra performance when you need it.</p>
<p>With <strong>Gemini AI integration</strong>, the Pixel 10 becomes an interactive assistant that can understand natural conversation through Gemini Live and you can point your camera at things or text you don’t know and ask questions in everyday language. The camera will give you answers based on what it sees and this visual lookup feature can be used in a variety of situations, such as recognizing plants while hiking or translating signs in other languages in real time.</p>



<p>The <strong>main sensor in the triple rear camera system is 48 megapixels</strong> and has optical image stabilization, so it takes clear pictures even when your hands aren’t perfectly steady. The<strong> 10.8-megapixel telephoto lens gives you 5x optical zoom</strong> which keeps the quality of the picture when the subjects are far away. The 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens gives you a wider view for landscapes and group shots and the Super Res Zoom uses both optical and digital methods to get 20x magnification while keeping details that pure digital zoom destroys on other phones.</p>
<p><em>Camera Coach</em> looks at your composition in real time and suggests changes to make your shots better and gives you tips on framing, lighting, and positioning that help casual photographers take better pictures. You can see this advice as you frame shots, not after you’ve already taken bad pictures which makes the learning process quick and useful.</p>



<p>The <strong>Actua OLED display is 6.3 inches wide and has a resolution of 1080 x 2424,</strong> and the refresh rate changes from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re watching (to save battery, static content like reading drops to lower refresh rates). The screen is clearly visible even in direct sunlight, where many phones become unreadable, because the peak brightness is 3,000 nits and the IP68 rating means that the screen can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes and still be safe.</p>
<p>The <strong>4,970mAh battery lasts for more than 24 hours of normal use</strong> between charges, so you can use it all day and night without needing to charge it in the middle of the day. Fast charging sends 30 watts through the USB-C port to quickly charge the battery when you need it and Qi wireless charging at 15 watts lets you charge your phone without a cable at home or in the car.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 costs $549, which makes it a flagship option that offers high-end features without the $1,000 or more price tags that come with premium iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. This long Cyber Monday deal shows that December can be a better time to shop than the first holiday shopping weekend for people who are willing to wait.</p>

                <p>This week, From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-characters-for-6-hours/2300-6466558/" data-ref-id="2300-6466558">two new playable characters</a>, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.</p><p>One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.</p><p>The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been "mitigated."</p><p>If you want to unlock The Forsaken Hollows' new characters and face the new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting the new DLC</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-headphones-stuck-at-cyber-monday-price-amazon-never-raised-it-to-clear-stock-out-2000650104</link>
            <guid>1372357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept pricing steady on select flagship products after Cyber Monday ended, and the Bose <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones remain discounted at what marks their lowest price point yet. These<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/"> wireless noise-cancelling headphones now sell for $199 instead of the regular $349 tag</a>&nbsp;which brings premium Bose audio and industry-leading noise cancellation down to a price bracket where you’d typically find mid-tier alternatives with compromised performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adaptive noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones have <strong>microphones around each earcup that constantly pick up sounds</strong> from the outside world and they make sound waves that are opposite to the noise that is coming in, which cancels it out before it gets to your ears. This active noise cancellation works over a wide range of frequencies and gets rid of everything from the low rumble of airplane engines to the mid-frequency chatter of people talking in an office. The system changes in real time as your acoustic environment changes and for example, it automatically lowers the cancellation strength when you move from a quiet room to a busy street. The plush over-ear cushions block out noise passively by making a physical seal around your ears. This works with active cancellation to make the silence even deeper than either method alone.</p>
<p>When you need to concentrate or sleep while traveling,<strong> Quiet Mode turns on full noise cancellation</strong> for the best isolation, while Aware Mode lets outside sounds through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or traffic without taking them off. This mode of transparency uses the same outside microphones that cancel out noise. It picks up sounds from the outside world and mixes them in with your audio playback in a natural way and with the push of a button, you can switch between modes, which lets you quickly adapt to situations where being aware is important for safety or socializing.</p>



<p>High-fidelity audio drivers make sound clear across the whole frequency range, bringing out vocal and instrumental details that are lost on cheaper headphones. You can change the bass, midrange, and treble settings right in the Bose Music app. This lets you change the sound to fit your tastes or make up for different types of music. When you want cleaner mids in bass-heavy electronic music, lowering the low-end can help. On the other hand, adding treble to acoustic recordings can bring out string details.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on,<strong> the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multi-day trips or full work weeks without needing to plug in. Plugging it in for just 15 minutes gives you 2.5 hours of playback time, which is great if you forgot to charge it overnight and need to leave right away. The included audio cable with an inline microphone lets you connect the headphones with a wire when Bluetooth isn’t available or when the battery dies in the middle of a flight.</p>



<p><strong>With multipoint Bluetooth</strong>, you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them automatically based on which one plays audio first. You can stay connected to both your laptop and your phone at the same time, you can answer calls on your phone without having to disconnect from your computer or miss notifications while watching videos. The seamless switching between devices makes it easy to switch audio sources without having to go into Bluetooth settings every time.</p>
<p>The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head, stopping the pressure points that form when you wear poorly made headphones for a long time. The over-ear cushions are made of memory foam wrapped in synthetic protein leather. This makes them feel soft against your skin and keeps their shape even after years of daily use and these headphones stay comfortable even on long flights across the ocean or during eight-hour work days.</p>
<p>The $199 price drop is $150 less than Bose’s top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, which puts them in competition with brands that can’t match their adaptive ANC, sound quality, and comfort all day long.</p>

      <p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> first launched on PC, its installation size was a whopping 154GG. It is now, thanks to the magic of Going Back And Taking A Look At Things, a measly 23GB. Please, God, let this be the one good trend in video games for 2026.</p><p>Developer Arrowhead first announced plans to shrink the PC version's size down<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>last month</u></a>, saying that 154GB figure was "roughly three times larger than the same game installed on consoles!" The reason given for this was that the team wanted to support older mechanical hard drives found on older PCs (all modern consoles have solid state drives), and so in order to give players with those HDDs a playable experience, they "duplicated" a bunch of assets like textures and sound effects, so that a mechanical hard drive didn't need to go reaching all over its surface area just to respond to what was happening at speed on the screen.</p><p>Which sounds wonderful in theory, but months of analytics post-release<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>have revealed</u></a> that not only are a small number of <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players actually using a mechanical HDD--around 11%--but that the pre-release industry standard figures Arrowhead used to make the decision to accommodate them in the first place were off.</p><p>They've found that it's the generation of levels causing the biggest slowdown, not the constant loading of assets, and that their projections for how slow HDD users were going to find things were also "very conservative". So a new "slim" version of the game is now being tested in a public beta (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which you can join here</u></a>), clocking in at just 23GB, and this version--optimised for everyone--will only "result in minimal changes to load times - seconds at most".</p><p>I'm fascinated by this. We live in an age where video game studios and publishers <em>obsess </em>over metrics, yet these numbers were so wrong! And in fixing them, a major video game is going to free up so much precious space–<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ssds/its-not-just-ram-ssds-could-soon-cost-way-more-too-and-its-all-downhill-from-here/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>something that could get very expensive soon</u></a>--that I can install at least 13 indie city-builders where those 131GB used to be!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-playstations-elite-pro-controllers-dualsense-edge-selling-at-record-low-2000650140</link>
            <guid>1372333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon still has PlayStation controller inventory left over from the holiday rush including both standard models and the DualSense Edge that’s built specifically for serious gamers. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Edge is currently sitting at its all-time low price of $169 instead of the usual $199</a>, and this Black Friday pricing has stuck around in both available colorways (black and white versions).</p>
<p>This controller matters because <strong>it gives you the kind of customization and performance features</strong> that competitive players actually need, with swappable stick caps, adjustable triggers, and back buttons you can program for complex game mechanics. Sony designed this as their pro-level answer to third-party controllers, which means you get official hardware with warranty support instead of gambling on aftermarket alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Upgrade to the Edge Controller</h2>
<p>You can <strong>switch between three different cap styles</strong> on the modular stick design, depending on the game you’re playing and how you like to hold your thumbs. Most of the time, regular caps work just fine but in shooters, high dome caps help you aim more accurately, and in fighting games or racing games, low dome caps let you move faster. You can change these out in seconds without any tools, so it takes less time to set up your gaming system than it does to load the game itself. The sticks use the <strong>same haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology as the regular DualSense</strong>&nbsp;so you still get that immersive tactile response that makes PS5 games feel different from games on other systems.</p>



<p>Those back buttons change the way you play complicated games that need you to input multiple things at once: You <strong>can assign any button function to the back paddles</strong> so you can reload, jump, or crouch without taking your thumbs off the aiming sticks. In competitive shooters, where a split-second delay in moving your thumb to hit X can mean the difference between winning and respawning, this becomes very important. The controller has built-in memory that can hold multiple profiles. This lets you set up different button layouts for different games and switch between them with a special function button.</p>
<p>With the <strong>adjustable trigger system</strong>, you can set how far you need to pull L2 and R2 before they register. There are also multiple stop points that shorten the distance you have to travel. In shooters, shorter trigger pulls mean faster firing because you don’t have to wait for the trigger to hit the bottom before the next shot registers. You can also change the dead zones on the analog sticks in the console’s settings menu.</p>



<p>The<strong> carrying case that comes with it protects the controller</strong> while it’s being moved and has extra stick caps and a USB cable for wired play. You can connect via USB-C for tournament play or when wireless latency is important. However, the Bluetooth connection is already fast enough that most players won’t notice a difference. The battery life is about the same as the regular DualSense <strong>so you can expect it to last about 5 to 7 hours</strong>, depending on how much you use the haptics and adaptive triggers.</p>
<p>At first, Sony priced this controller at $199 which made it hard to sell compared to the $74 DualSense (currently selling around $55-$60). You pay less than 2.5 times the cost of the base controller for features that really improve your competitive performance and comfort while playing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/irobot-roomba-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-basic-stick-vacuums-but-only-on-amazon-2000650099</link>
            <guid>1372309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon keeps some Black Friday deals going until early December and the <strong>iRobot Roomba 105</strong> is still at its lowest price ever which makes robot vacuums affordable: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">model is now on sale for $149 on Amazon instead of the usual $299</a> which is the same price as a basic stick vacuum without any smart features. Robot vacuums do the work for you, so you don’t have to push a vacuum around your house several times a week and you can use that time for anything else while your floors stay clean.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>LiDAR Mapping</h2>
<p>The <strong>ClearView LiDAR sensor spins around the room</strong> while the Roomba moves, sending out laser beams and measuring how long it takes for each beam to bounce back from walls, furniture, and other things in the way. The robot uses this information to make an exact map of your home’s layout which it keeps and uses during every cleaning session. The<strong> mapping process goes quickly at first</strong> but the Roomba gets better at knowing your space over time as it runs into new obstacles or sees that the furniture has been moved.</p>
<p>The navigation system makes sure that the cleaning paths are efficient and cover your floors in neat, parallel rows, like how you would mow a lawn. This methodical approach makes sure that everything is covered while cutting down on unnecessary passes over areas that have already been cleaned. This extends battery life and speeds up the completion of tasks. Specialized sensors keep the Roomba from falling down stairs or off ledges by finding stairs and drops.</p>



<p>The three-stage cleaning system uses a brush that works on multiple surfaces, an edge-sweeping brush, and a suction channel to pick up dirt from different types of floors.<strong> iRobot says that this model has 70 times more power-lifting suction than their older 600 series robots</strong> and it creates enough airflow to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and cracks in hardwood floors. The edge-sweeping brush goes beyond the robot’s round body and into corners and along baseboards, where dust collects and circular vacuum paths usually miss.</p>
<p>You can control the Roomba Home app from your phone and you can start cleaning sessions from anywhere, set up automatic runs based on your daily routine, and make sure the robot stays away from pet bowls or other delicate areas. You can change the suction power and set the number of cleaning passes for each room. This lets you change the intensity based on how much dirt and traffic there is in different areas.</p>



<p>Spot cleaning mode cleans a small area over and over for up to five minutes which is helpful when you’ve spilled something or see a really dirty spot that needs extra attention. <strong>Voice control integration works with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant</strong> and it lets you start or stop cleaning sessions with your voice when your hands are full or you’re in another room. There are physical buttons on the robot itself that let you start cleaning quickly without having to open the app or look for your phone.</p>
<p>At $149, robot vacuums go from being a luxury item to a useful investment that costs the same as stick vacuums that you have to use your time and energy to operate. The 50% off sale makes advanced LiDAR navigation and smart mapping features available at a price that was only available with basic random-pattern cleaning in earlier models.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday came and went with some decent Apple deals on Amazon, but the retailer didn’t move all its inventory during the rush. That means the all-time low pricing on the MacBook Air M4 256GB, which launched in March 2025, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">is still available right now at $749 instead of the usual $999 tag.</a> This matters because Apple rarely sees discounts this deep, especially on hardware that’s less than a year old.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes the Way This Machine Works</h2>
<p>The Apple M4 processor makes things a lot faster and you’ll notice it right away when you switch between demanding apps. Video editing software that used to stutter now works perfectly with 4K video, and you can run multiple Chrome tabs and Photoshop at the same time without hearing a fan noise because there isn’t one. The chip <strong>architecture puts the CPU, GPU, and neural engine all on one piece of silicon</strong> which makes data move faster between parts and uses less power. This means that the <strong>battery can last up to 18 hours</strong> without dying when you’re doing real work instead of just browsing Safari.</p>



<p>This<strong> hardware can run Apple Intelligence on its own</strong> and it can do things like help you write, make images, and organize your files without sending your data to other servers. The privacy architecture does everything on the device, so your personal information never goes to the cloud for processing. This is very helpful when you want to summarize long email threads, make custom emojis based on descriptions, or have the system sort notifications by how important they really are.</p>
<p>The<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has a brightness of 500 nits</strong> and can show one billion colors: This means you can work outside without having to squint at a dim screen. The text is clear enough that you won’t strain your eyes when you write for a long time, and the colors in photos are accurate enough that designers and photographers can trust them. The bezels around the screen are thin enough to give you the most viewing area without making the whole thing too big to handle.</p>



<p><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 ports handle charging, data transfer at 40Gbps</strong>&nbsp;and video output to external displays, so connectivity is complete. You can use two external monitors at the same time, which turns this light laptop into a real workstation when you’re at your desk. <em>MagSafe</em> charging is back and it has a magnetic connection that safely disconnects if someone trips over the cable. This keeps both your laptop and your sanity safe. If you have a router that works with Wi-Fi 6E, your wireless speeds will be faster. The<strong> four-speaker system with Spatial Audio</strong> makes the sound surprisingly immersive for a chassis this thin and the three-mic array also does a good job of isolating your voice during calls, even in noisy places.</p>
<p>This price of $749 is $250 less than what the hardware usually sells for which is a good deal because it usually holds its value all year. You’re getting a current-generation processor with twice the base RAM, which will keep the machine up to date for years to come with software updates and more demanding applications. This <strong>is the lowest price ever for anApple laptop</strong> that can handle both creative work and everyday tasks without any problems.</p>

Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon.</p><div title="[Various] Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3304" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch/dp/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch\/dp\/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch/dp/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch/dp/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch\/dp\/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch/dp/B0979ZHC5B?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$25.31 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form.</p><p>This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art.</p><p>If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.</p></div>                      </div><h3 dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQXSKLWQ,B0FQXH13RT,B0FQY47SLH&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Where to Buy Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo</a></h3><hr><p>If you haven't picked up the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo, all three are in stock at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXH13RT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samus</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXSKLWQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samus &amp;

            <p>
There are two Brendan Greene's (or PlayerUnknown's, however you prefer to refer to the game dev). There is the Brendan Greene who wants to listen to the feedback offered up by those partaking in the early access period of his current game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>. And there is the Brendan Greene who doesn't, for quite reasonable reasons. Both of these are still him, and both show up in a recent interview.
</p>
<p>
First, the Greene who wants to listen to feedback. The developer recently spoke with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/were-trying-to-use-early-access-in-the-way-it-was-meant-to-be-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-wants-his-new-survival-game-to-be-built-with-the-community-rather-than-for-them/">PC Gamer</a> about Prologue, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">out in early access with a name that Edwin seems to dislike as much as me</a>, where he explained his intention for going with an early access release strategy. "I want to build games with the community, rather than for them, because that's how I got into gaming; I came from modding," Greene explained, pointing to examples like how a free run mode and free roam mode were added in thanks to player feedback. He notes that the thing they're trying to do is "to use early access in the way it was meant to be."
</p>
<p>
It's an admirable approach, even if community feedback shouldn't always be listened to because sometimes you need to draw a hard line. And draw such a line Green has, as in the same interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/playerunknowns-new-survival-game-already-has-three-dlcs-planned-but-wont-include-one-fan-favourite-idea-i-think-the-weather-is-sufficiently-worrying-at-this-stage/">PC Gamer</a>, he explained that the number two requested feature in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game is adding animals.
</p>
<p>
"But, if we add animals, that would mean you need something to defend from animals," Greene explains. "While we can technically add animals, as we figured out pathfinding stuff for the world, it's a lot of resources to program good AI for animals. You want them to feel real, especially in the world we're building."
</p><p>
He continues to note that getting there while being happy with the results would require a lot of resources, but he'd rather focus on "building a more complete world, with paths, power lines, and even bigger points of interest that are not just cabins. That's where I want to focus the team, rather than adding more things for you to worry about. I think the weather is sufficiently worrying at this stage."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, I do not think listening to community feedback is something that should be treated as gospel just because a large number of people want something. You have to stand firm sometimes! Adding animals does sound like it would fundamentally change the thing that Prologue is, and besides, there's surely a similar enough survival game out there that lets you be hunted by a wolf or something, no? Anyway, forget about all that hogwash I just said, Brendan, if you're reading this change the game's name it really is an odd one.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-twin-stick-shooter-is-the-new-geometry-wars-and-it-rules-2000650227</link>
            <guid>1372282</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m very annoyed that I have a job, that I have to go to the bathroom, that I have to write this damn blog. All I want to do is play more <em>Sektori</em>, a newly released roguelike twin stick shooter that all fans of <em>Geometry Wars</em> should play ASAP.</p> <p>Out now on <a href="https://www.gimblll.com/sektori/#:~:text=Store%20Links%20(Game,Steam">Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, <em>Sektori</em></a> is one of those games that takes less than five minutes to understand and yet will suck up hours of your life in no time. You control a small, colorful shape that must destroy other vibrantly glowing shapes and objects that will damage you if touched. Blast and dodge these bastards with your laser canon, which, like your shield, overall speed, and dash ability, can be upgraded during each run, to defeat the boss and set a new high score. It’s very simple and very, very good.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>Sektori</em> looks incredibly sharp and slick, with loads of particle effects and eye-popping neon art. Seriously, look at this game in action.</p>  <p><em>Sektori</em> understands that the main appeal of games like <em>Geometry Wars</em> is watching the playfield fill up with all manner of colorful objects and shapes, and then systematically evaporating them using your blasters and power-ups. But it builds on that formula by pulling in some gameplay mechanics found in games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Halls of Torment.</em></a> Each little shape you blast away leaves behind some shiny glimmer. Pick up enough of this stuff, and you’ll spawn an upgrade token. Save a few of these up, and you can replenish your shield, unlock missiles, or upgrade your laser gun.</p>

 <p>Occasionally, you’ll be asked to pick a card to unlock a new perk. I’m not entirely sure how this works, and that’s because <em>Sektori</em> has one other cool ace up its neon-lined sleeve: It ain’t as simple as you might think. There’s more going on here that the game chooses not to explain in the brief tutorial, and discovering the secrets in <em>Sketori</em> and how everything works has made it extremely easy for me to just go “Well, one more run won’t hurt!” And then suddenly I’ve been playing for two hours. It helps that the game runs flawlessly, features great music, and feels incredibly snappy to play.</p> <p>I mean, I literally downloaded this game on my father-in-law’s Xbox Series X while visiting for Thanksgiving. I just wanted to play a few more rounds. And now, I’m done writing about <em>Sektori</em>, and I’m going to go back and play more of it. Leave me alone. Thanks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you’re looking for a good daily driver that can handle web browsing, productivity apps and streaming without breaking the bank, you don’t need to spend $2,000 on a MacBook Pro: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">HP 15.6″ (256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel Core chip) laptop is now on sale for $369 on Amazon, down from its usual price of $1,999</a>. This seems to be an inventory clearance sale that has brought this model’s price down to its lowest point ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Everyday Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Processor N100 has four cores that run at a base frequency that can go up to 3.4GHz</strong> when tasks need more processing power. It also has 6MB of L3 cache to help frequently accessed data load quickly. This chip is part of Intel’s lineup of chips that are made for thin and light laptops, where battery life and heat management are more important than raw benchmark scores. This processor won’t let you work on 4K video projects or play demanding games, but it can handle the everyday computing tasks that most people do without slowing down.</p>
<p>With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you can keep dozens of browser tabs open at the same time as Microsoft Office apps and video conferencing software without having to move data to the slower SSD and this much RAM is enough to make you stop worrying about closing programs to free up memory. The 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD loads Windows and apps faster than mechanical hard drives, but you’ll need to be careful about how you use the space because modern games and big media libraries can fill it up faster than you’d like.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen shows content at a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> and has an anti-glare coating that cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights. The 250-nit brightness rating is good enough for most indoor lighting, but you might have trouble reading the screen in direct sunlight or very bright places. Intel UHD integrated graphics can play videos and do basic photo editing and they have enough power for casual older games, but not enough for modern AAA games or heavy creative work.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 connections are faster and work better in crowded networks than Wi-Fi 5 connections; Bluetooth 5.3 keeps wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones connected without dropping out. Two USB-A ports let you connect older peripherals without needing dongles, and the HDMI 1.4b output lets you connect to external monitors or projectors for presentations and more workspace.</p>



<p><strong>Windows 11 Home</strong> comes with a desktop interface that most people are used to and works with a huge number of Windows programs that have been made over the years. You can use traditional desktop programs like Adobe apps, business software, and games from Steam on a Chromebook without the limitations that come with web-based workflows. The headphone/microphone combo <strong>jack works with standard 3.5mm audio devices</strong>&nbsp;and the built-in webcam is good enough for video calls for work and school from home.</p>
<p>At $369, this HP is at the same price as a Chromebook, but it has full Windows functionality and more RAM than you’d expect to find at this price point. Amazon is probably clearing out its remaining stock, which is why the price has dropped so much from the inflated $1,999.</p>

                <p>For a game that's been in development since 2012, it was a surprise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape from Tarkov</a> finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/" data-ref-id="1100-6534196">emerged from early access</a> in November. And now that it's possible to really escape from Tarkov, someone's done it and shared the video to prove it.</p><p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has been acknowledged by Battlestate Games as the first player to find a way out of Tarkov in this first-person-extraction shooter. In a post captured on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvD4dRjIqR/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, the devs wrote, "Congratulations to Tigz on being the first to Escape From Tarkov. You survived. But at what cost."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996" data-ratio="1.3076923076923" data-width="442" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996"></a><figcaption>The image sent to Tigz as proof of his accomplishment as the first player to escape from Tarkov.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg"></figure><p>Tigz also shared the video that demonstrated how he got his character out of Tarkov alive.

But the developers didn't make it easy. Each attempt costs $5 million and the final quest looks like it's ridiculously over-the-top.</p><p>So far, only a handful of players have been able to follow Tigz's example and bust out of Tarkov. There are multiple endings in place for this game, and a player named Tsukinogi has been recognized as the first player to escape from Targov with the best possible ending.</p><p>If players purchased Escape from Tarkov before it was released on Steam, then they will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/" data-ref-id="1100-6534783">to buy the game all over again</a>. Battlestate Games has previously released a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC. At a later point in time, Battlestate Games dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and kept the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p>

I think games are generally quite bad at acknowledging that they are things that are made by people. These people tend to have conversations about ideas, which turn into implementing those ideas, and sometimes these ideas are abandoned. We've all enjoyed a deleted scene in the extras of a DVD, yet the cutting room floor does not seem to be a thing for most games, at least not publicly. Which is why the new B-Sides DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a>, a chill cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/make-the-night-city-of-your-dreams-with-this-cyberpunk-city-sandbox-builder">quite liked</a> by some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-dystopika-you-are-the-chill-landscaper-of-a-vast-cyberpunk-city-and-it-is-exactly-my-cup-of-noodles">former RPSers</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developer Voids Within explain in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059922?l=english">Steam post</a> that, "like the B-sides of a record, this DLC contains unreleased experiments and concepts that were previously cut at the sketchbook or concept art phase which have now been fully realized as new props and districts." So, less of a deleted scene, and more of an alternate cut, but I'm liking their musical metaphor too.

<p>
In terms of what's included, for starters there's a new district called Rustport. This, you will not be surprised to hear, looks like quite a reddy orange locale, so at least it lives up to its name. There's a new megastructure called Port Terra which looks like two Beyblades stacked on top of each other. You'll also find a new utility district, Scaffolding, again a place that looks like it lives up to its name. Aside from that, there's more than 20 new props, like a couple of monorail styles and airships, a bunch more hologram projections, and 12 new C-ville and Labber's Row signage variations.
</p><p>
This DLC also coincides with a new update, bringing in version 1.7.0 of the game. Included in this are a couple of new tools, the first being a density brush that lets you paint up or paint down smaller procedural buildings. The other tool is literally called the "Nothing" cursor. 
</p>
<p>
"That’s right, a tool that does nothing!" the devs explain. "Admire and navigate your city without those pesky building previews. The cursor tool can be found next to the Destroy tool in the toolbar." And there's also a new prop, a hologram wall emitter, which "allows placement on walls and angled surfaces for more versatile placement of holograms." Not to mention there's a bunch of quality of life improvements and bug fixes - you can take a full gander of the patch notes right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059914">here</a>.

<p>Ahead of Season 1’s launch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the complete patch notes have been released. In it, details regarding new maps, weapons, modes, adjustments, and several bug fixes have been addressed.</p>



<p>Released in November, Black Ops 7 is the latest in the iconic FPS series. While it hasn’t reached the heights of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successors or rivals like Battlefield 6</a>, it’s still growing. With Season 1, the shooter is going all out with new additions and fixing several elements after fan feedback. </p>



<p>In Season 1, new maps for Zombies and Multiplayer are available and will be released throughout the season. The biggest fixes come to the Ricochet Anti-Cheat system and bullet penetration, which were heavily mentioned by fans after release. In addition, weapons like the NX Ravager and Ballistic Knife can be secured via new challenges. On top of all that, many bug fixes and adjustments have been made to the UI and gameplay. </p>

    <article>
      <p>Earlier today, Humble followed in the hoofprints of <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic</u></a> by yanking bafflingly controversial art game <em>Horses </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>from its digital shelves</u></a> – in this case after the storefront had already made it available for purchase. Now, mere hours later, Humble has relisted <em>Horses</em>.</p><p>IGN’s Rebekah Valentine <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3m74exeicds2c?ref=aftermath.site"><u>broke the news</u></a>, which was immediately met with a collective “Huh.” Aftermath reached out to Humble for more information but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva said that Humble temporarily pulled <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it, but found no reason to set that decision in stone.</p><p>"In short, their team saw the press coverage and temporarily delisted <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it," Riva said. "After a full review they determined that while the content is heavy, nothing in the game warrants removal from their store."</p><p>"We are grateful to Humble for having reconsidered and for taking the time to check out the game, although I wish they had informed us that this process was ongoing!" he added.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/octopath-traveler-0-everything-we-know/</link>
            <guid>1372174</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Though not a new Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest game, the first two Octopath Traveler games established the series as an important one for JRPG fans to pay attention to. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">Octopath Traveler</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, could easily be considered two of the best JRPGs to be released in the last decade. Now, Square Enix has continued the series with a prequel for the third installment, with Octopath Traveler 0. Here's everything we know about the turn-based prequel.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">first announced back in July 2025</a>. Its reveal trailer was included as part of Nintendo's Partner Showcase Direct in July, and its release date of December 4, 2025, was announced alongside its initial reveal. Revealing the project and announcing the release date all in one, approximately five months ahead of said release date, was a clear sign from the jump that this game was nearly finished and would not miss its release date from delays, which is exactly what happened.</p>



<p>A prologue demo was also released on November 11, which allows you to play the opening three hours of the game, with your progress carrying over into the full version, should you decide to purchase it after playing the demo. </p>



<p>The standard edition of the game costs $49.99, with the deluxe edition listed at $59.99. Pre-ordering either edition gets you the Travel Provisions downloadable content, which is essentially a bundle of in-game items that you start the game with to give you a leg-up without having to grind for them in the story. The Travel Provisions for pre-ordering either the standard or deluxe edition are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing Grape (M) x5</li>



<li>Inspiriting Plum (M) x5</li>



<li>Revitalizing Jam x2</li>



<li>Icewind Mastery</li>
</ul>



<p>If you pre-order the deluxe edition, not only do you get the items listed above, but you also get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Three Action Skills: Triple Strike Mastery, SP Saver Mastery, Extra JP Mastery</li>



<li>8 Types of Nuts (M): Fortifying Nut (M), Magic Nut (M), Tough Nut (M), Resistant Nut (M), Light Nut (M), Critical Nut (M), Sharp Nut (M), Slippery Nut (M)</li>



<li>Festive Town Decorations: Table with roasted chicken, Festive Arch, Large Festive Arch, Festive Flag, Grand Vase</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, the deluxe edition also gets you a digital art book. There's also a massive collector's edition that is <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/octopath-traveler-0">available exclusively from the Square Enix store</a> for $229.99, which includes everything listed above, along with, per the Square Enix store listing, "<em>a physical replica of the in-game key item, the Ring of the Flamebringer; an original-design deck of playing cards; a set of three 8-sided metal dice; a game mat for multiplayer fun; a specially edited art booklet; and an arrangement music CD, available here ahead of its market-wide release.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like the first two Octopath Traveler games before it, Octopath Traveler 0 is a turn-based JRPG presented in an HD-2D visual style, which blends 2D sprites with 3D environments. It's pixel-art based, and fans of the first two games would have no issue recognizing a screenshot from the game as an Octopath Traveler title.</p>



<p>Set within the fictional continent of Orsterra, unlike the first two games, which feature eight protagonists with their own individual stories, Octopath Traveler 0 focuses on a single protagonist created by the player. After customizing your appearance, voice, Job, and other unique aspects of your character, the journey begins in your hometown of Wishvale, which is tragically burned down by Hermania the witch, Tytos the hero, and Auguste the playwright at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p>It's then up to you to restore Wishvale and take revenge on the three villains who brought your home to ashes.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The tactical turn-based battles will be familiar to players, though there are a few significant changes like evolving from four characters in a battle to eight, giving you more opportunity to mix and match the jobs, action skills, and abilities at your disposal when in a fight. The game also introduces Ultimate Techniques, which you'll learn as the story progresses and allows you to deliver a powerful blow to your enemies in battles, particularly if you wait until your available Ultimate Technique is powered up to its level three maximum.</p>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 also features a new branch of gameplay with the restoration of Wishvale. You'll get to manage elements of Wishvale's rebuild by establishing different facilities and customizing them. Rebuilding Wishvale and upgrading the town's facilities also unlocks key features to the gameplay and provides a mix of things to do in between your adventuring.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As an HD-2D game with a pixel-art design, Octopath Traveler 0 is by no means a demanding game for any platform.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications from the game's Steam page:</p>



<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 11 64-bit</li>



<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 2300X / Intel Core i3-8100</li>

<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 470 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>

</ul>



<p><strong><em>Recommended:</em></strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-4-is-17-years-old-but-looks-practically-next-gen-thanks-to-a-new-mod-2000650202</link>
            <guid>1372171</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new free mod for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-ivs-story-is-better-than-gta-vs-1690387521"><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></a> breathes fresh life into the early PS3-era open-world game and its aging visuals, making the dated blockbuster look almost as impressive as some modern releases.</p> <p>Rockstar’s<em> Grand Theft Auto IV</em> launched on Xbox 360, PS3, and (eventually) PC all the way back in 2008. While the console versions were great and are fondly remembered to this day by fans, the PC release was a mess that was often cited as one of the worst AAA ports of that era. <a href="https://kotaku.com/years-later-rockstar-releases-new-pc-patch-for-gta-iv-1789523135">But thanks to some official updates</a> and the hard work of fan modders,<em> GTA IV</em> is very playable on PC in 2025. It even runs well on Steam Deck. And a newly released path tracing mod makes the nearly two-decade-old crime simulator look incredible on a sufficiently powerful computer.</p> <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">Created by modder Xoxor4d</a>, GTA4 RTX Remix is a mod that adds gorgeous path-traced lighting to the game via Nvidia’s RTX Remix tech. This mod doesn’t change any textures or swap in any higher-res assets. This is still mostly <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> from 2008. But now every light source, like headlights and the sun, reacts more naturally with the objects and environments around them.</p>

 <p>What this mod pulls off without changing any geometry or textures is impressive and, at times, near-photorealistic, <a href="https://youtu.be/vGxPdcMQfwg">as seen in this video</a> that was released when the mod was still locked behind a paywall. And it’s especially impressive when compared side-by-side to the OG game.</p>

  <p>GTA4 RTX Remix is a great example of how realistic, advanced lighting can make even older games look far more impressive. To me, this is the tech I want to see game developers and console makers focusing on as the next big thing. I don’t need 8K resolution or 240 FPS. I want accurate shadows and light bouncing off surfaces naturally. <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-hl-ray-tracing-rt-mod-valve-pc-mod-download-1850150600">As seen in <em>Half-Life</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-mods-modder-max-payne-swat-portal-pc-1849884871">other older games</a>, this kind of tech can make games look truly next-gen.</p>

 <p>Technically, GTA4 RTX Remix has been floating around online for a few months now, but it was only available to folks who subscribed to the mod creator’s Patreon page. However, last week, after it had been thoroughly tested, the mod was made public for all to download and enjoy for free. You can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx">Xoxor4d’s GitHub page</a>, where the modder has instructions on how to install the mod and how to make it work with the popular <em>GTA IV</em> mod Fusion Fix.</p> <p>While it ain’t perfect, Nico’s head is far too shiny, for example, I still think anyone wanting to replay <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> in 2025 should get this mod and Fusion Fix working together to experience the best version of the game. Who needs Rockstar to remaster <em>GTA IV</em> when fans are doing it already and for free? Just be prepared for some FPS drops if you are playing on an older PC or don’t use DLSS.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Micron Shutting Down Its Consumer Crucial RAM and SSD Brand]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/</link>
            <guid>1372165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Micron is completely shutting down its consumer brand Crucial, and is ending the line of budget-friendly RAM and solid-state drives (SSDs). </p>



<p>Announced on Wednesday, Micron said that the growth of AI has led to this “difficult decision”.</p>



<p><strong>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” </strong>Micron EVP Sumit Sadana said in the media release.<strong> “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</strong></p>



<p>Sadana continued to thank the “passionate community of consumers” the Crucial brand has had over the last 29 years.</p>



<p><strong>“This decision reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage,”</strong> the company added. <strong>“By concentrating on core enterprise and commercial segments, Micron aims to improve long-term business performance and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Micron says Crucial shipments will continue until the end of February 2026, and they will work with partners and customers to provide warranty service. </p>



<p>The decision to end the entry-level Crucial brand comes at a time when AI and data center growth continue to harm the consumer sector. Because of larger companies buying up all the supply, consumer RAM <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have even risen by 250%</a> and beyond across different brands. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/moba-project-zeta-announces-signups-are-open-for-final-closed-beta</link>
            <guid>1372162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Try your hand at a five-team race for dominance.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming multiteam MOBA game Project ZETA announced today that signups are open for its next beta test, which will begin on Steam on December 12. This final closed beta will be the last chance to jump in early before the game goes public, and the developers have asked for opinionated players to help shape its future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/1-zeta-shot-010-bi-lb-1764716012578.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with Project ZETA, we can catch you up to speed. Developed by Nirvanana, a team built of former Eternal Return devs, it mixes up the traditional MOBA formula in two key ways. First, instead of the standard of having two teams go head-to-head, it pits five teams against each other at the same time in a race to capture Prisms, the game’s most precious resource. There are multiple ways to get Prisms, giving each team the opportunity to follow different paths to victory. And second, it uses a third-person camera rather than an isometric one, making combat more dynamic and action-focused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combat is PvPvE, with monsters and bosses populating the map. Defeating monsters will score you XP and shards, which can upgrade your abilities and provide buffs to your stats, cooldowns, and more. Defeating bosses gets you all of that plus Prisms. However, just picking up a Prism isn’t enough, you need to return it to the center of the map in order for it to actually count toward your score.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/2-zeta-shot-020-bi-lb-1764716056984.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the PvP comes in. Competing teams can ambush you on your way to deposit your Prisms and steal them from you. And that looming threat constantly affects the strategy your team chooses. Do you blitz bosses and try to rush their Prisms to the center of the map to win quickly? Do you bide your time, taking down monsters to scale your team's power and enter the next fight better prepared? Or do you lie in wait near the center of the map to pounce on opposing teams and take their Prisms after they’ve already done the work for you?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/3-zeta-shot-030-bi-lb-1764716093527.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">These are all viable strategies, but the reality is within one match you’ll jump between all three. In Project ZETA, strategies shift dynamically from one moment to the next. With five teams roaming the Aran Plateau, improvisation matters most. Focus too much on one adversary and another might stab you in the back, or worse, run up the score to take a commanding lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your strategy will also be driven by the heroes your team members choose. There are currently 13 heroes, with more to be revealed in the future, and they’re grouped into four categories: Fighter, Marksman, Assassin, and Mage. Each hero has unique abilities that can synergize with other heroes, some of which can trigger devastating multikills if you pull them off at the right time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/7-zeta-shot-090-bi-lb-1764782232839.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been six months since Project ZETA’s second closed beta, and a lot has changed in that time. In fact, it’s been the period with the biggest advancements in the game to date. There are two new heroes, reworked visuals and abilities for most heroes, new game-changing equipables, revamped environments, simplified Prism scoring, team respawn fixes, and lots more, all based on player feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final beta test will offer another chance to provide more feedback and further enhance the game. Anyone in North America or Europe can sign up for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778110/?utm_source=na&amp;utm_campaign=ign&amp;utm_medium=cbt3&amp;utm_content=NAign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a>, and both regions will have devoted servers running on two weekends: the first will be December 12–14, and the second will be December 19–21. For those who can’t stop playing, there will also be a custom game server that will stay live for the entirety of the beta, from December 12–21.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/6-zeta-shot-070-bi-lb-1764782127541.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Project ZETA is also available to wishlist on Steam, and if you want the latest info and updates, you can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Discord server</a>, follow on <a href="https://x.com/ZETAtheGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Facebook</a>, or check out its <a href="https://zeta.krafton.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/moba-project-zeta-announces-signups-are-open-for-final-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>
