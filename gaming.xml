			<p>Almost five years after its debut on PlayStation 5, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</a></strong> is finally hitting other consoles next month with a release on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing more users to enjoy the first entry in the trilogy. Ahead of the new ports release, Square Enix has released a playable demo today, which also serves as yet another great showcase of what the Nintendo Switch 2 can do with dedicated optimization taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.</p>



<p>The demo allows players to experience the iconic bombing mission, accompanying Cloud Strife and Barret Wallace as they set out to destroy one of the Mako reactors powering the city of Midgar, ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company. Any progress made in the demo on both <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/it-IT/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fit-IT%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo%2F9NFTWDJKGSBF&amp;prompt=none">Xbox Series X|S</a></strong> can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, and all those importing a demo save file can claim the bonus items <em>"Revival Earrings"</em> and <em>"Survival Set"</em>.</p>

<p>With so many multiplatform games targeting both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there's little doubt that Microsoft's consoles should be able to handle Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade well. As such, there's obviously more curiosity surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 version, and the demo confirms that the new generation Nintendo console will deliver a more than playable experience, featuring great image quality that's almost on par with the PlayStation 5 release, judging from the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976008"><strong>first screenshots</strong></a> shared on <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976341">ResetERA</a></strong> by user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/often-ignored-bear.51892/"><strong>Often Ignored Bear</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With such outstanding image quality on display, the community consensus on this port is unanimous. "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Played through it just now in handheld. This looks nearly identical to how Intergrade looks on a base PS5 in Quality Mode. The hair has some dithering at times but looks fine overall. This is an INCREDIBLE port," </em>said ResetERA forums member <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148978135">Neiteio</a></strong>, echoing a widespread sentiment among fans.</p>



<p>The launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S will mark the beginning of a year very likely filled with Final Fantasy VII news. According to director Naoki Hamaguchi, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a name for the final entry in the trilogy will be decided before the end of the year</strong></a>, suggesting that the game's first reveal has a very high chance of happening in 2026. </p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-20-million-players-dead-island-3-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Dead Island 3 as they celebrated the second installment reaching 20 million players (including those who played through subscription services and even those who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed it for free from the Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a> earlier this year).</p>



<p>Now, though, Internet spotter extraordinarie Timur222 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered</a> from Dambuster's financial statements that the UK studio is targeting Q1 or Q2 2028 as the launch window for Dead Island 3. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Dambuster Studios is a AAA video game developer based in Nottingham which has 194 employees (as of March 2025). 93% are working in development and the remaining staff are studio management and administrative support. After the release of Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3. All developers are assigned to the project, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete, all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3. Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028.</em></p>



<p>Dead Island 2 launched on April 21, 2023, which means that Dead Island 3 will be out in less than five years, provided there are no delays on the schedule.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 took a long time to be released. It was first in development by Yager, which showcased the game with a playable demo at Gamescom 2014. However, publisher Deep Silver was not satisfied with the developers' direction for the project and removed Yager from it. In March 2016, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Sumo Digital would make the game. Three and a half years later, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned</a> to Dambuster Studios, an internal Deep Silver studio.</p>



<p>With so many developer changes, there was widespread skepticism about the final game's quality, but Dambuster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a fun experience</a> that resonated with fans, convincing Deep Silver to assign Dead Island 3 as the studio's next project.</p>

Kennedy will return as the game’s second playable protagonist. Although he has aged a bit since we last saw him, Japanese fans have been taking to social media to praise Leon’s suave, older look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Slated for a multiplatform release on February 27, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline title in Capcom’s survival horror series. It will introduce new main character Grace Ashcroft, an FBI analyst who is investigating a series of mysterious deaths that seem to be linked to Victor Gideon, a former Umbrella Corp. researcher. While it seems that Grace’s parts of the game will play more like typical survival horror, the new trailer, below, gave fans a peek at Leon’s more action-orientated zombie-battling gameplay, complete with chainsaw. “Grace’s gameplay style is based on Resident Evil 2, whereas Leon’s is based on Resident Evil 4,” director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed in a recent interview with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Denfaminicogamer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Leon has always had his fans, the D.S.O agent’s middle-aged incarnation is getting much praise from Japanese speaking users on X. He’s already being affectionately called <em>ikeoji </em>(literally, “hot uncle” — a cool and attractive older guy). “Leon’s gradually becoming a hot uncle” one <a href="https://x.com/haniwa_yukkuri/status/1999433332824961140?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> mused. Sharing some screenshots, another user<a href="https://x.com/negisiogyutane/status/2000154859803488548?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> chimed in</u></a> with “Leon’s aging in a cool way.” Another user <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999314797108822499?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>summed up</u></a>: “Resident Evil 9’s Leon is too hot. He’s 49 in this (as of 2026)? He’s so suave."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also getting inspired to draw Leon’s new look. “Leon in Resi 9’s new trailer is too damn fine,” said one user, posting the following fan art. “He’s aging in such a wonderful way, while retaining his coolness. I’m really looking forward to meeting this Leon,” enthused <a href="https://x.com/rain_rain1192/status/1999346834343673964?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another user</u></a>. “He’s turning into a hot older guy, like Keanu Reeves!” said one <a href="https://x.com/SzbSPfoK2FCnJe4/status/1999412747344499085?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">RE9新トレーラーのレオンが良すぎて。 <a href="https://t.co/PIkrWuylo1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PIkrWuylo1</a></p>— □ (@dbox_2525) <a href="https://twitter.com/dbox_2525/status/1999474848154943767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other eagle-eyed trailer viewers have <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999376630771499194?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noticed</u></a> that Leon seems to have some kind of rash on his neck, prompting concerns that he has been infected. While many seem to be enjoying middle-aged Leon’s looks, <a href="https://x.com/NkVkGMw4Mt49044/status/1999455932095537519?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> are worried as to whether he should still be fighting off mutants at his age, with one person saying: “I love Leon, but they should let him rest.” In the previously mentioned Denfaminicogamer interview, Resident Evil Requiem’s director revealed that Leon has a “major secret” that will have significant implications (but he’s keeping quiet on what exactly that is).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">コメントで教えてもらったけど<br>レオン..感染してるのかい？...<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%83%8F%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#バイオハザードレクイエム</a> <a href="https://t.co/6GY05WqofY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6GY05WqofY</a></p>— それいけジェットでやってみよう！ (@neko_sougo) <a href="https://twitter.com/neko_sougo/status/1999397917627736427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Japanese game developer Hideki Kamiya also weighed in on Leon’s new appearance and how some of Capcom’s beloved characters are getting long in the tooth. “Uncle Leon, at the very least, I would like for you to live happily in your old age,” Kamiya commented, sharing a timelapse of Leon’s aging face. In response, another user wrote that, although they were fine with game characters getting older, they hoped that Resident Evil and Devil May Cry characters could receive the happy ending they deserve. Replying to this, Kamiya mused: “Even if Dante became happy, won’t he always be poor?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">レオンおじさん…せめて老後は幸せに暮らして欲しい… <a href="https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1999371106193703131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem’s devs have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna"><u>already revealed</u></a> that switching between playing as Grace and Leon will be like “jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna,” such is the contrast between the tense survival horror sneaking and Leon’s no-holds-barred action. According to director Akifumi Nakanishi, there will be an almost equal split between newcomer Grace and fan favorite Leon. "Although he’s a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him into an 'ikeoji',” Nakanishi concluded. "The reactions to the trailer on that front have made us happy (laughs).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We have new official information on Dead Island 3, which is not only now confirmed to be in development, but has a target release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a financial report spotted by X / Twitter user @bogorad222, the Plaion-owned UK developer Dambuster Studios said its primary focus is now Dead Island 3. This is the first time we’ve heard Dead Island 3 mentioned in any official capacity, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-next-outbreak-is-already-brewing-it-looks-like-weve-got-our-first-dead-island-3-tease">the studio had teased it earlier this year</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Dambuster Studios' financial statements are out (as of March 2025)<br>The company employed 194 employees<br>Dead Island 3 is in development<br>The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028 <a href="https://t.co/FOHOitH3nD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FOHOitH3nD</a></p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The report mentions that all Dambuster’s developers are now on Dead Island 3, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete all of Dambuster's QA team will also move over to Dead Island 3. As of the end of March 2025, Dambuster had 194 employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace,” the report continues. And here’s where things get really interesting: we even have a “current predicted release window” of Q1/2 2028. So, as things stand, Dead Island 3 is due out by the end of June 2028.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The existence of Dead Island 3 shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. In September, Dambuster posted the image, below, alongside the caption: “and the next outbreak is already brewing.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/080bf1e43f9ba2fbaa205d74e2bc142a82a22810-1757436135047-1765877525023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dead Island 3 is coming.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi,” the message continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next. For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the image, we can safely say Dead Island 3 will be set somewhere other than LA, which stands to reason. But where? Given the person shown in the image is hitching a ride, perhaps Vegas is a natural stopping off point. But really, it could be anywhere. After all, the first Dead Island was set on a fictional island chain in Oceania.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Dead Island 3 does come out the first half of 2028, it’ll arrive five years after Dead Island 2, which itself suffered long periods of development hell before eventually enjoying significant success. Dead Island 2 was revealed at E3 2014 but soon went quiet before "mutual differences" separated Yager from Deep Silver. It was then moved to Sumo Digital before being shifted again in 2019 to its final home of Dambuster Studios. A new trailer and gameplay video was released on December 6, 2022, during a Dead Island 2 showcase that announced it was delayed once again, slipping 12 weeks to April 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, when will we get our first look at Dead Island 3? Perhaps 2026 will bring a teaser trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Two more actors have been cast in Netflix's upcoming Assassin's Creed adaptation, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name.</p>
<p>Lola Petticrew (pictured below), who is known for Bloodlands and Trespasses, and Zachary Hart (pictured above) have both joined the show, though their characters at this time are being kept under wraps. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/assassins-creed-zachary-hart-netflix-live-action-series-1236647717/">Deadline</a>, Hart - whose previous credits include Slow Horses - will be a series regular.</p>

<p>The duo will be joining previously announced cast member Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor set to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>
<p>While characters in the upcoming series are still unknown, it was previously said they will be different from the games. A report last month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-show-will-be-set-in-ancient-rome">claimed the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series</a>, and include figures from Ancient Rome such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger.</p><p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation has been a long time coming, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is expected to take place in Italy next year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, it really is just a case of when and not if Ubisoft will announce a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry Black Flag. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">a myriad of leaks and rumours</a>, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the PEGI ratings board website</a>, further confirming its existence.</p>

			<p>You’ve almost certainly heard of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, and chances are you’ve also heard of Inspector Morse, Sam Spade and Nancy Drew. Or my personal favourite, Inspector Barnaby&nbsp; – Tom, not John – though I’m not going to get picky if it means that more murders are committed in Midsomer soon. I’m looking at you ITV.</p>
<p>But I digress. There’s one thing that all these names have in common. They’re all super sleuths. Outstanding fictional detectives with household names that crime-solved their ways into our hearts with their lovable quirks and magnificently calculating brain-boxes.</p>
<p>And the latest investigator vying to add his name to the list? John Morley, a gritty 1940’s private detective, probing the facts of a case to end all cases in the aptly named video game, The Last Case of John Morley. But will Mr Morley’s name be entered into the fictional sleuth hall of fame?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Case of John Morley - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XncKeNsBgmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the start of the game, we meet John Morley in a hospital bed recovering from a previous case that nearly killed him. Returning to his office, he meets with a new client, an old lady who offers him a big wad of cash to solve a cold case; the murder of her daughter two decades ago. And so off Morley pops to a creepy old manor house to do some investigating.</p>

<p>There’s no mistaking that The Last Case of John Morley has a brilliant and intriguing story to tell. There were a few jump scares that, although heavily signposted, managed to go some way to construct a suspenseful horror atmosphere, and as the narrative unfolds the player will be treated to some enjoyably surprising plot twists. If you’re a fan of a good mystery storyline, you will be more than satisfied with how the plot unfolds. Sadly, the whole tale is – ironically – let down by the video game medium through which it has been told. For me, the game mechanics, low-quality visuals and character work all got in the way of the storytelling.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the game mechanics. As you guide John Morley through a variety of different rooms, you’ll be prompted to select certain highlighted items of evidence that will be followed by a sentence or two of dialogue from Morley. &nbsp;The problem arises when the game stops you from progressing until you have selected every single item of evidence available in the room, right down to the last splatter of blood. You may think this a good thing. Surely, this means you’re unlikely to miss out on any evidence relevant to solving the case? Not quite.</p>
<p>Despite appearances, The Last Case of John Morley isn’t actually a detective game. It’s more of an interactive walk-through of a mystery story. There are none of the typical game mechanics that you’d expect to find in a detective game – organising and linking evidence, deciphering clues, choosing where to go or who to interrogate next – instead, John Morley does everything for you. You’re just along for the ride. And to point and click. As you can imagine, this quickly becomes overly restrictive, time-consuming and worst of all, boring.</p>

<p>Then there’s the clunky visuals. These are particularly grating in the sections where you talk to characters face-to-face. Interrogating witnesses is equal parts terrifying and painful to watch. Their wide eyes stare, unblinking, through the screen, their faces blank and unmoving except for their bottom lip that bobs up and down like a puppet in an attempt to match the words being said. How can you tell if a character is lying if they always have the same vacant look on their face? If you want the player to connect with the emotions of the story, facial expressions need to be the priority.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re hoping that the voice-over work might save the day. Inject a bit of energy and atmosphere into proceedings. Unfortunately, it doesn’t. The voiceover work is some of the worst I’ve heard. I felt I could have produced a less-wooden performance from my satnav. This is such a shame because the dialogue in the script is actually really great! The performances sap any atmosphere out of proceedings and will leave you wondering whether AI actors would actually be so bad after all. And the worst part? You can’t even skip ahead. There’s no reading the subtitles then hitting “next” to minimise your suffering. Plus, you have to ask every question available to you. You have to listen to it all. Every. Last. Wooden. Word.</p>

<p>All in all, The Last Case of John Morley has a storyline that you’ll want to inhale in one sitting. If you could read it in a book. Not play it as a video game.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> art director Robert Sammelin has shone some light on the inner workings of the extraction shooter's matchmaking system, confirming that player behaviour is indeed a factor in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/">Speaking to PC Gamer at The Game Awards</a>, Sammelin stated: "Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We analyse behaviour and match accordingly." When asked if he was able to elaborate on the matter, Sammelin said "no" and laughed.</p>
<p>Instead, the interview shifts to the topic of player passivity in general, and how the team at Embark has been able to see it in data gathered from Arc Raiders matches. Sammelin explained: "We got some figures on how many people have even downed another player, and they were surprisingly low at a large scale. There's also quite a difference in playing with a squad or solo with this, [which] opens up a very different experience depending on how you choose to engage with the game from the get-go.</p>

<p>"Of course data is great, the amount of data we get from telemetry is really helpful in finding out what we should be addressing, tweaking, or tuning. Pairing it up with internal assumptions is invaluable in terms of tuning and balance. That's something we'll keep doing continuously."</p><p>Arc Raiders has garnered somewhat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">a reputation for player pacifism since its launch earlier this year</a>. Some players have even argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">PvPers were ruining the experience, in what is clearly a high-stakes PvPvE genre</a>. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">even quizzed a sociologist on the matter</a>, given the interesting dynamic between those friendly players and others engaging with the extraction shooter as intended.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand, there's plenty to do right now in Arc Raiders. In fact, today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">the game's frosty map condition has been added to the game</a>, with a Christmas-themed community event pushing raiders to head out and collect berries for the festive season.</p>

<p>According to a post on Reddit from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrisCube64/">ChrisCube64</a>, the reduced input lag has now made the game "actually playable". The original post reported lag of around 14 frames, but a follow-up comment noted that the speed running community timed the input lag at 6 frames. The update has now reportedly reduced this down to around 4 or 5 frames.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0hlpmou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Still not perfect, then, but any improvement is a win. Other users are reporting reduced input lag for other titles on the GameCube app, but it seems the most notable improvement is on The Wind Waker. We've reached out to Nintendo to hopefully obtain official confirmation, and we'll update this article in due course.</p>
<p>The GameCube app now boasts a total of seven playable games, including the aforementioned Wind Waker and Wario World, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II.</a> More are on the way in the future, including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

            <guid>1384348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the surprises of The Game Awards 2025 (well, I should say up to a few hours before the event, since the announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leak-suggests-game-is-a-remake-of-the-first-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked beforehand</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. Fans of the most famous gaming heroine knew that Crystal Dynamics was working on a new game, which was indeed unveiled at the show, but the remake of the beloved first entry in the action/adventure series was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will offer Lara Croft fans a chance to experience some of the old-school magic in 2026, on the 30th anniversary of the franchise, leaving Crystal Dynamics a bit more time to release the new entry in 2027. The game is being co-developed with Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind Hard Reset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-warrior-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Warrior</a>, Trek to Yomi, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-west-ungodly-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil West</a>.</p>



<p>The Italian website Multiplayer <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis-passato-futuro-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the chance to interview two key developers from Crystal Dynamics</a>, Game Director Will Kerslake and Studio Head Scot Amos, following the TGA 2025 announcement. Speaking about Legacy of Atlantis, they said:</p>



<p><em><strong>Scot Amos:</strong> We want to honor the original DNA of Core Design, but through the lens of the modern gamer.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Will Kerslake:</strong> The realities of 1996 and 2026 are different. We want Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to evoke the same feelings as the first time you played it, but it must be a modern game experience when you play it. We kept the confident Lara and most of the puzzles, but had to completely rebuild the combat and exploration systems. </em></p>



<p>Granted, we wouldn't have expected anything different. This isn't a remaster, and the game would feel very old as a reimagining if those key systems were kept unchanged. Still, Kerslake also said that the brutal traps of the original Tomb Raider, such as the big, deadly rolling boulders, have been maintained.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Crystal Dynamics developers confirmed that the Lara Croft seen in Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and in the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the same character, just in different stages of her life and career. The former game revisits her origins, while Catalyst, which will indeed be set in India <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per earlier rumors</a>, will show Lara at her pinnacle.</p>



<p>In both games, Lara will be voiced by British actress Alix Wilton Regan, whose credits include Calista in The Last Story, Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3, the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Veilguard), Aya in Assassin's Creed Origins, Selemene on Dota: Dragon's Blood, Alt Cunnigham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Daedric Prince Ithelia in The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and the female player character in the upcoming Squadron 42.</p>

            <p>There's now a free demo available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S, ahead of the full release in January.</p>
<p>The demo includes the iconic first chapter of the game, and progress will carry over to the main game. Note that on Switch 2, you'll need at least 8GB of space to download the demo, but this is a great opportunity to see how the game runs on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>What's more, you can grab a free copy of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game if you pre-order Remake digitally on either platform. That's only available until 31st January 2026, but that's enough time to experience the 1996 original before diving into Remake.</p>

<p>Those who pre-order the physical version of Remake will receive a Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Play Booster back, containing 15 random cards (while stocks last, at least).</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake will release on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd January 2026. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">full Remake trilogy will eventually be available across both platforms</a>, in addition to PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">physical version of the game will be a Game Key Card</a>, meaning it's just a physical key for a download - you'll still need over 90GB of space for the game, making it one of the largest on the system.</p>
<p>Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi has also confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">development of the third part won't be impacted by the multiplatform approach</a>. It remains unknown if its eventual release will be simultaneous, or a PlayStation exclusive for a limited time.</p>

The free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo is now live on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html#Overview">Switch 2 eShop</a>.</p>
<p>We've got a new trailer (above) showcasing what you can expect from this one on Switch 2 and Xbox — though, if you have already played it elsewhere, the cutscene content will be old news.</p>
<p>The free demo will take you through the entirety of the opening Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission, and yes, your save data will carry over to the main game, so there's no need to worry about playing it all through again next year.</p>
<p>Those who play through the demo will be gifted the bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set” in the full game when it releases on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, FFVII Remake plays at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-confirms-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-runs-at-a-stable-30fps-on-switch-2">"stable" 30fps</a> on Switch 2, but that hasn't stopped everyone who has played it from having a wonderful time. We loved our time with the port when we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands-on at Gamescom</a> earlier this year, and Digital Foundry previously called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"The best-looking thing" on Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <p>What's that I hear? Tinkly piano and the crashing of waves. Oh, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first major expansion, which devs Team Cherry have just announced will be coasting up to the shore some point next year. It's called Sea of Sorrow, and as such looks to contain plenty of somber staring into the splashy swell.</p>

<p>Team Cherry announced this forthcoming addition to the metroidvania via the trailer above and <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">a blog post</a>, also noting that the nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow'll be "free for all players". It'll include "new areas, bosses, tools, and more".</p>
<p>The trailer itself's made up of four shots. Two are just some fishing hooks and the shot of Hornet from the update's key art, but in between are a couple that could have more intrigue to them. First's a shot of some creature or object resting atop a wooden platform and tied under a sheet, somewhat resembling a tomb. Then, there's a shot of an ornate, but damaged, glass and gold structure being struck by crackling lightning. It's also littered with what look like discarded bug wings.</p>
<p>What the skong does any of that mean? Well, I'm nowhere near dialled enough into the Hollow Knightverse to speculate, with Team Cherry promising more will be revealed prior to release.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the studio have released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">beta update</a> for the Steam and GOG PC versions of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, to coincide with it being released on some device from an obscure company called Tin Nendo. Nah, I've never heard of them either. The PC update's headlined by support for 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratios and extra controller support. Team Cherry have also sought to reduce any colour banding and made the game pause automatically when you open up your inventory.</p><p>Aside from that, there are some general bug fixes, and one problem on Steam Deck you'll still have to work around for now. "There is an issue with cutscenes showing a 'test pattern' when playing on Steam Deck, which is due to the system defaulting to an incompatible proton version," Team Cherry wrote of the latter. "We are working on a fix for this, but for now it can be worked around by selecting a 'Linux Runtime' version in the compatibility settings, which forces the system to use the Linux-native version of the game."</p>
<p>As usual, instructions as to how to opt into the beta can be found in Team Cherry's post about it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go and buy some Hornet-sized armbands and a rubber ring.</p>

This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, as Silksong's initial release date wasn't announced until just a month before it dropped after one of gaming's most infamous drawn out affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the announcement of the DLC, Team Cherry also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the original Hollow Knight is in development. This improved version incorporates "all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The even better news? If you already own Hollow Knight on Switch, you'll be able to upgrade to this new gen version for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Australian studio will also be updating all current versions of the original Metroidvania soulslike and adding features and bug fixes. If you're playing on PC, some of those changes have already come into effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PC players can experience many of those updates right now, via the public-beta branches on Steam and GOG, where they’ve just gone live,” a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Cherry blog post</a> states. “That includes full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support for those of you with Steam Decks or ultrawide monitors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the DLC announcement, Team Cherry said Hollow Knight: silksong had sold more than 7 million copies since going on sale in September, and had millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!)," Team Cherry said. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now seems like as good a time as any to get into both Hollow Knight games, then. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight review</a> returned a 9.4. We said: "Hollow Knight’s rich world and incredible depth of content will make you want to explore its caves for dozens of hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> scored the game 9/10. We said: "Hollow Knight: Silksong is packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat that's all unapologetically challenging in just the right way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<p>Silksong is the follow up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and ever since it was announced back in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-just-made-my-day-live-reactions-to-the-silksong-release-date">many were left desperate to get their hands on it</a>. It finally materialised three months ago across multiple platforms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">crashing many digital store fronts in the process thanks to the sudden influx of eager players</a>.

<p>Team Cherry has today announced it has sold over 7m copies of Silksong in the last few months. That number is full fat sales, and does not include the "millions more" who have played via Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p><p>"It's a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected," <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">Team Cherry said</a>.

<p>"Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p>
<p>Speaking of expanding the game even further, the developer went on to detail Silksong's first expansion known as Sea of Sorrow, which is coming out next year. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-unveils-first-big-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-and-its-completely-free">nautically themed expansion will include new areas, bosses, tools and more when it arrives as a free update for all players</a>.</p>

<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/any-future-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-would-exist-alongside-the-others-as-standalone-entry-says-team-cherry">Team Cherry recently flirted with the idea of more entries in its Hollow Knight series</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>

		<p>Team Cherry is signing off 2025 and the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> this year by announcing… more Silksong! The team is cooking up the first expansion for the series, in the form of Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow, which will be available as free DLC.</p>
<p>Not only that, but there’s a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> upgrade for the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, which also has improvements for other version in the works.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDFEeeLy6ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With over 7 million purchases of the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and many more on Game Pass, Team Cherry writes that “most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands.</p>
<p>“It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.”</p>

<p>So that’s what they’re doing with Sea of Sorrow, which continues Hornet’s adventures in a new nautical themed expansion, a&nbsp;<em>free </em>expansion at that. It will bring new areas, bosses, tools, and more to toy around with.</p>
<p>But that’s not all, because the team is also working on an updated version of Hollow Knight for the Nintendo Switch 2 for release in 2026. This will bring high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and additional graphical effects that were not included in the base Switch release.</p>
<p>All platforms will be updated alongside this to bring some new features and bug fixes, and PC players can test these right now with a public beta branch on both Steam and GOG. This includes proper 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support (great for Steam Deck players), and a list of fixes and improvements as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.</li>
<li>Game now pauses while in inventory menus.</li>
<li>Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)</li>
<li>Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.</li>
<li>Reduced Grey Prince Zote’s stagger bounce height.</li>
<li>Updated Sly’s Great Slash collider to closer match visual.</li>
<li>Salubra’s Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.</li>
<li>Map panning is now smoother</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio's online wuxia-themed action/adventure roleplaying game, Where Winds Meet, continues to attract more players to its finely crafted world. <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, the game registered over 15 million players in its first month since launch. This milestone follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous one</a>, when the game had reached over 9 million players in just over two weeks. Granted, four days ago, Everstone Studio also launched Where Winds Meet on iOS and Android, which certainly helped a great deal with its absolutely massive addressable market.</p>



<p>Still, the game deserves much of the success it's enjoying. It's rare to find such a finely made free to play game, almost capable of rivaling premium titles in most regards, and even surpassing them in a few aspects. In Wccftech's 8.5/10 review, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I wish the MMO mode were not strangely devoid of NPCs, which makes it feel significantly less like a real open world compared to the solo mode. Still, it appears that most players are largely unaffected by this design choice.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Anyway, with such a strong fan base behind Where Winds Meet, Everstone is full steam ahead on delivering <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its original promise of a living, constantly evolving wuxia world</a>. This month alone, the players <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can expect new bosses, a new region, and new activities</a>. The developers have also teased the first expansion, The Imperial Palace, which is scheduled for release sometime next year.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025</a>, a new game in the fantasy RPG franchise, Larian Studios has also released Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series S|X. The game was already available on the respective previous consoles (PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One) and could be played on the new ones through backward compatibility, but this is a native version and will therefore offer improved performance.</p>



<p>Existing users can follow Larian's guidelines to upgrade:</p>



<p><em>Depending on your platform, if you already have Divinity: Original Sin 2 installed, you'll receive a free update with the version applicable to your console. If you don't currently have it installed but would like to play again on a current-gen console, navigate to the Divinity: Original Sin 2 store page on either Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and you can download the upgrade for free. If you would like to upgrade your copy of Divinity: Original Sin 2 from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 or from PS4 to PS5 and are based in Japan, the upgrade will cost ¥100.</em></p>







<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition launched in 2018, a year after the base game, expanding the storyline and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-divinity-original-sin-2-refined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refining certain gameplay aspects</a>. The vanilla game was already amazing, though, having been widely acclaimed as one of the greatest cRPGs of all time by critics and fans. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Wccftech</a>, it scored 9.6 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>It's hard to find a game with little to no flaws, but Larian Studios proved that, sometimes, it happens. With excellent story and characters, smart writing and masterfully crafted gameplay enhanced by the multiplayer modes, Divinity: Original Sin 2 truly deserves a place among the best cRPGs ever released.</em></p>



<p>Of course, it would later go on to be surpassed by Baldur's Gate 3. Still, if you haven't played it yet, it's a great way to get accustomed to the world of Rivellon in preparation for the freshly announced new entry. Larian assured that newcomers won't have problems if they choose to wait specifically for the upcoming game, but also said that those who played the previous installments will have knowledge of 'some continuity and characters'.</p>

            <p>
Well if you thought we were done with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> excitement for 2025, think again. Team Cherry is wrapping up its year with a few last bits of business, including news of an enhanced version of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and, most excitingly, a first look at Silksong's first big - and completely free - expansion Sea of Sorrow, coming next year.
</p>
<p>
We already knew some sort of Silksong DLC was on the way, of course; Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-supported-with-extra-content-for-years-to-come">confirmed plans</a> for post-launch "stuff" shortly after the game's release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-in-development">reiterated its intentions</a> back in November. Now, though, we've got a much clearer idea of what the studio's been working on. It's first big expansion is called Sea of Sorrow, and it's coming to Silksong in 2026.

<p>
"Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion", Team Cherry teases, before <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">elaborating further elsewhere</a>. Sea of Sorrow is, as you've no doubt guessed, "nautically themed", and will include new areas, bosses, tools, and more when it arrives as a free update for all players. Expect more details "shortly before" the expansion's release.
</p><p>
Additionally, Team Cherry has announced a Hollow Knight Switch 2 Edition, which will feature similar enhancements to those already enjoyed by Silksong on the platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects". It'll be free for owners of the existing Switch version, and there's a free update coming to other platforms too.
</p>
<p>
PC players can check out many of the update's features right now in a public-beta branch available for Steam and GOG. A full list of current additions can be <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">found in Team Cherry's patch notes</a>, but expect to see the likes of expanded controller support, the inclusion of 21:9 and 16:10 resolutions, smoother map panning, and the ability to pause in inventory menus. More improvements will be added before the update's full release next year.

            <p>
Today sees the release of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> Cold Snap update, which douses the popular sci-fi extraction shooter in glittering snowfall. Ah, how gorgeous the flakes twinkling above the Spaceport gantries. How beautiful the frozen lakes of Dam Battlegrounds. It's definitely a mite nippy all of a sudden, though, isn't it? Best take shelter in that bunker before your fingers and toes turn Uncommon green and Rare blue.</p>
<p>Oh dear, there's another player inside that bunker and she won't let you in. Still, perhaps if you start shouting the patch notes through the door she'll relent out of curiosity? Very good, let's begin.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-set-for-a-cold-snap-next-week-and-it-looks-like-forgetting-to-pack-your-mitts-could-be-deadly">As described last week</a>, the Arc Raiders Cold Snap update buries the game's four default maps in the white stuff. "Snowstorms sweep across Speranza as winter conditions take hold of multiple raid locations," explains a press release. "Snowfall reduces visibility, lakes freeze over, and the open surface becomes more dangerous than ever -- turning every raid into a high-stakes survival run."
</p>
<p>
In particular, you will now have to worry about frostbite, or at least, a slow health drain mechanic called frostbite, while rambling outdoors. You won't run the risk of losing any appendages to gangrene, I think. "Raiders must rethink their loadouts, ensuring they can heal themselves or their teammates and plan their extractions with care, finding shelter if needed," comments the press release.
</p><p>
The temperature drop accompanies a modest blizzard of Arc Raiders add-on content. There's the Goalie Raider Deck, the second of the game's Raider Decks, which is yours for free come 26th December, and will be permanently accessible with no time limits. It includes new items and player feats to perform for Raider tokens, cosmetics and such.</p>
<p>Pride of place goes to the hockey-inspired Raider outfit with matching hockey stick raider tool.  I myself used to play (grass) hockey and have, in fact, played hockey in blizzards so thick you could barely see the opposing goal. This was during my grim Yorkshire childhood, when everybody knew that the only way to make kids grow up right was to nearly murder them with bad weather. I've still got my old  stick, propped over the door in humiliating mimicry of a World War heirloom. I'm pretty sure it'll break if I touch it, let alone brain a rival scavenger for a bagful of batteries.
</p>
<p>
Expect two time-limited seasonal events in the course of the Cold Snap. On December 16th, there's the Flickering Flames Event, which boasts 25 levels of new gear, customisation elements and Raider tokens. These are earned by way of Merits, gained from XP in rounds. On December 26th, please gird your loins for the Candleberry Banquet Project, which sees you collecting Candleberries to earn rewards, and is broken into five stages, each with a new banqueting scene. Polish off stages to earn further rewards, including Merits for the aforesaid Flickering Flames event. God, remember when all you had to do in games was gather coins and not die. 
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, this December brings the opportunity to prestige your current character - sorry, I mean, send them on an expedition. This lets you pay a bunch of resources to reset much of your progression, including your player level and inventory. Why would you do this? Because starting over freshens up the experience and makes you feel like Maximilian Gamer, Destroyer Of Worlds. Also, you're awarded a few perks in return to help you begin a fresh character, such as increased XP gain, bonus skill points, and more stash space. Expeditions give you eight weeks to prepare, and the first one "leaves" on 21st December.

<p>Announcing the 'Woolhaven' expansion</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Every developer is rushing to get their last announcements of 2025 out the door, and with this in mind, the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> has today locked in a date for their new expansion, which will be dropping on Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The Massive Monster family confirmed in a special "mid-winter showcase" that <strong>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</strong> would be releasing on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>).</p>
<p>This expansion will continue from the main story, and begins when an "unexpected calling from the forgotten God takes you on a perilous new adventure" across a mountain to Woolhaven, the "ancestral home of the Lambs".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yngya, the God of Winter, unleashes frost and snow across the land, making keeping your flock safe, warm, fed and watered the greatest – and most <em>rewarding</em> – challenge faced by The Lamb yet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will come loaded with new dungeons, buildings, weapons, characters, quests and systems. There's also a new "ranching system" – allowing you to tame, ride...and <em>eat</em> majestic beasts. You can find out more in the showcase video below:</p>

<p>For a limited time, you can also pick up the base game of this roguelite for <strong>50% off</strong> its usual price in select regions (bringing it down to <strong>$12.49 / £11.24</strong>). In some other news today, a new expansion has also been announced for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:135857,195359 @ 1765883677 -->
<p>Will you be returning to Cult of the Lamb on the Switch to try out this new expansion? Or do you still need to play through the base game and other content? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Ward Appears to Debunk Recent Modern Warfare 4 Leaks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/</link>
            <guid>1384282</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that 2026’s Modern Warfare 4, the rumored next release in the Call of Duty series, will be ‘a complete copy of Modern Warfare 2’ from 2022. It was suggested that the upcoming game’s multiplayer platform is a carbon copy of the 2022 title, right down to the ‘excessive visual recoil’ mechanics.</p>



<p>However, Infinity Ward recently signed off social media for the festive window, chiming in with a comment that directly flies in the face of this claim, prompting Call of Duty fans to lose their minds.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-modern-warfare-4-a-copy-or-not">Is Modern Warfare 4 a Copy or Not?</h2>



<p>TheGhostofHope, a reliable Call of Duty leaker, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-multiplayer-is-reportedly-a-complete-copy-of-modern-warfare-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to social media</a> with a bombshell claim:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He expanded soon after:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the comments, while others revelled in the news. Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform wasn’t <strong>that bad</strong>, all things considered.</p>



<p>However, in the days that followed, Infinity Ward snapped onto social media with a clear message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy holidays everybody! </p>



<p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon. </p>



<p><strong>Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet.</strong> </p>



<p>See you in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is almost certainly disputing the recent Modern Warfare 4 claims, and TheGhostofHope was quick to respond as he came under fire:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just gonna address this cause it seems like the perfect time to do so. I have been leaking Call of Duty for years and anybody who has followed me for a long time knows that. </p><p>I have leaked a ton of things about Vanguard, MWII, MWIII, BO6, BO7 before anybody else. Have I gotten…</p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000713405204988390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>TheGhostofHope’s followers rallied, suggesting that the leaker has ‘never been wrong’ about anything in the Call of Duty space.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Before Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 on November 15, Battlestate Games professed how difficult it would be to ultimately <strong>complete the game’s</strong> new campaign. The crushing difficulty and lengthy challenges of the story mode added with 1.0 would push even the most talented players to their limits, and the latest numbers indicate they weren’t lying.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Battlestate Games revealed that one million copies of the game have been sold since November 15, on top of the millions that were purchased before 1.0 was released.</p>



<p>They also shared that just 500 PMCs have completed the game, representing a drastically small minority.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-the-hardest-game-ever-made">Escape from Tarkov is the Hardest Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>If you take the 500 PMCs that have successfully run through to the end of Escape from Tarkov since the one million copies were sold post-launch, you get 0.5% of players.</p>



<p>If we assume that at least five times as many copies were sold <strong>pre</strong>-launch, you drill down to fewer than 0.1% of players having completed the game. The numbers are rough, but as Battlestate Games has never been transparent with the figures, it’s the best we have to go on.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the Escape from Tarkov campaign has only been around for <strong>one month</strong>. In that time, the concept of completing it has been available to very few people, and casual players will likely spend months trying to conquer it.</p>



<p>On December 1st, Battlestate Games revealed that Tigz, a streamer, was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first person in the world</a> to complete Escape from Tarkov, and in the days that followed, 500 more players managed to secure that accolade.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since its release, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a> has sold over one million copies.</p><p>In the first month alone, players spent a total of 135,000,000 hours (or 15,410 years) in the Norvinsk region. This is equivalent to over 200 million full Customs raids, had each lasted until the final minute… <a href="https://t.co/dZnCBV7Bdg">pic.twitter.com/dZnCBV7Bdg</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2000619759784583446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Now, in a new social post, the team has set up more numbers, alongside a celebration of one million sales post-launch and a new promo code (<strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong>) for all players to enjoy.</p>



<p>But why is this important?</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has always been considered one of the toughest games ever made. It’s a punishing thing that breaks gamers every day, offering a soul-crushing gameplay loop that requires players to load up, run a raid, and hopefully make it out alive.</p>



<p>At any point, a single, well-placed bullet can end everything, stripping them of their progress and their equipment.</p>



<p>There are no maps, no markers, no guidance lines, and no hand-holding mechanics. It’s a brutal experience, and that’s why only 500 players in the world have managed to complete the game thus far.</p>



<p>The number proposed here is 0.1%, but it’s likely lower than that. Escape from Tarkov was on the market for almost a decade in alpha and beta states, and that’s assuming that it sold just five million copies in that time.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has just shared the news that Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, has sold <strong>one million copies</strong> since hitting 1.0 on November 15. The game underwent an overhaul in November, marking it as a fully released game, and since that happened, it has been going like gangbusters.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that players have spent a collective 15,410 years in the game since November 15, equivalent to over 200 million full raids on Customs.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-still-on-top">Escape from Tarkov (Still) on Top</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is, in the eyes of many, the best extraction shooter ever made. It has stiff competition these days and more on the horizon, but regardless of what surfaces, it almost always remains the number one extraction game going. The most challenging threat the game has faced in recent years is ARC Raiders, but it’s still holding its own.</p>



<p>On November 15, Battlestate Games released the 1.0 update for Escape from Tarkov, bringing the game into a graduated state from the alpha and beta stages it sat in for almost a decade. With this full release having been logged, the team now looks to future projects, including new games, post-launch DLC, and even a console release.</p>



<p>To celebrate the one million milestone, Escape from Tarkov’s developers released a new promo code for all players to enjoy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s also important to stress that this is the first time Battlestate Games has shared sales figures for Escape from Tarkov. Over the years, estimations have been made, but the team has never been transparent about how many copies Tarkov has shipped. </p>



<p>This figure gives us an idea of how popular Escape from Tarkov has been since its release, but it doesn’t account for the (potentially) tens of millions of copies sold in the last decade.</p>

It was already one of the top hits of the year, but that added exposure has pushed Expedition 33 even higher than before.</p><p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, sales of Expedition 33 jumped 21% on PlayStation 5 and 76% on Steam. The bump was a considerably smaller 3% on Xbox, likely because Expedition 33 is on Game Pass. Regardless, the combined sales across PC and consoles post-The Game Awards is estimated to be over 200,000 additional copies.</p><p>Sandfall deftly timed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-celebrates-its-game-awards-blowout-with-a-major-new-update/1100-6536925/" data-ref-id="1100-6536925">new DLC for Expedition 33</a> to drop almost as soon as it won its final award at The Game Awards.

That's the game's highest count since June.</p><p>Circana senior director Mat Piscatella also noted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zyhnrgvk2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> that "the percent of US active PS, XBX and US Steam players engaging with the game more than tripled by Dec 13th when compared to Dec 10th. US Steam showed the largest lift." For December 13th, Circana notes that daily active users reached 13th on Steam, 30th on PlayStation, and 33rd on Xbox, all in the US. For added context, Piscatella told GameSpot that, "In this example, engagement means anyone that started the game. If someone just looked at the menu or played for 24 hours straight it counts. Active player means the percentage of all people who played any game that day on PS, XBX or Steam."</p><p>Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">made history at The Game Awards</a>, by winning nine out of the 13 categories it was nominated in.

You can also check out my more comprehensive list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-gift-ideas-2025">best Pokémon gifts for 2025</a> for more options than what I've listed here.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Top Pokémon Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've even taken the liberty of finding the best deals on the top chase cards for every Pokémon TCG expansion in the Mega Evolution and Scarlet &amp; Violet eras, so you can pick up some awesome chase cards instead of busting a bag full of Pokédollars on booster packs. I even found some awesome Pokémon Squishmallow deals to boot, so let's get straight into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG stock levels are getting better and better across the board, which means there's more chance of buying off store shelves and a much bigger chance of scalpers losing out. It's a win-win, especially for Pokémon card collectors, as single cards are finding a new floor when it comes to market values.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best time this year to snap up some of those grails you've been eyeing up, so I've found the top 5 chase cards in every Pokémon TCG expansion and base set from the previous Scarlet and Violet era, as well as Mega Evolution, the current era of Pokémon cards. There's some serious bargains to be had here, and I reckon we'll see prices tick back up when Ascended Heroes launches early next year, so don't wait around.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Best Pokémon TCG Sealed Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best deal here for me is the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection that's currently at market value on Amazon and close to MSRP. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while. It also contains Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A and More Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to get Pokémon Legends: Z-A sorted for Christmas? Here's the cheapest way: the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service. You're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot also has more discounts on top Pokémon Switch games, such as Legends: Arceus alongside Scarlet and Violet. It's a great time to build up your library if you've got a few Pokémon-sized gaps on your shelf.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Squishmallow Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing beats cuddling a Squishmallow, and I'll admit that to anyone. Well, getting a $69.99 massive 20-inch Sprigatito Squishmallow for $37.99 definitely beats that feeling, but there's some great deals on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">best Pokémon plushies</a> right now (in my opinion, which is correct).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrow-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1384222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">announced its first DLC expansion</a> for Hollow Knight Silksong, due to arrive next year. Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow will arrive on all platforms sometime in 2026, and when it does, it'll be free for all players. Not only that, but Hollow Knight will make its Nintendo Switch 2 debut next year, and since launch, Silksong has sold over seven million copies. </p>



<p>After so much silence, followed by one very loud boom, to already know about Hollow Knight Silksong DLC, and to be hearing so much about what's coming for both Hollow Knight games, doesn't feel right. It's exciting, though, particularly because you can't imagine that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">would take seven years on a project that is initially meant to be just an expansion again.</a> At least not with back-to-back games, right?</p>



<p>That means Sea of Sorrow will arrive in 2026, barring any delays. The initial teaser trailer doesn't showcase any gameplay, unfortunately, but it does feature more of the game's excellent art, and it's an exciting proposition to be getting a more water-based area.</p>



<p>"<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow is coming in 2026!</em>" the teaser's description reads. "<em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players.</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>With Hollow Knight: Silksong’s launch year coming to a close, we wanted to take a moment and share a peek at what we’ve been working on, what’s available now, and what’s coming in 2026</em>," Team Cherry began in a blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>But firstly, and most importantly, we wanted to say a huge thank you to all the players who’ve braved Silksong’s distant and dangerous lands. That’s over seven million of you who’ve purchased the game, alongside millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass!</em> <em>It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!). Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further. That first big expansion is already well underway!</em>"</p>



<p>The blog post goes on to confirm that the "<em>nautically themed expansion</em>" will feature "<em>new areas, bosses, tools, and more</em>." Team Cherry says it'll reveal more about Sea of Sorrow "<em>shortly before</em>" its release date next year.</p>



<p>As for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight, this new version will include: "<em>all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: High frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects</em>," and, like the update between the Switch and Switch 2 version of Silksong, be entirely free.</p>



<p>If you have the game on PC on Steam or GOG, you can check out the new changes now through a public beta branch that's now live. It also includes support for 16:10 and 21:9 monitors, so players with an ultrawide screen can take advantage of the update right away if they like.</p>



<p>Silksong launched this past September, and since its arrival, it's been one of the biggest games this year. We already knew that Team Cherry <a href="https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-thinking-about-non-hollow-knight-games/">was working on DLC</a>, but it's even more exciting to know that we can all ring in the new year knowing that we'll be able to check it out sooner than later.</p>

                <p>A few years ago, Nightdive Studios resurrected the classic Nintendo 64 FPS series, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, with enhanced remasters on PC and consoles. While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31. And now, just a few weeks since launch, the collection is up to $30 off at multiple online retailers. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+Up+To+30%25+On+The+Turok+Trilogy+Bundle+For+Switch+And+PS5&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-15+14%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-15+18%3A20%3A50&amp;fnarticle_id=6536984&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3DTurok%2BTrilogy%2BBundle%26lang%3Ddefault%26start%3D0%26sz%3D20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnightdive-turok-trilogy-bundle-physical-ps5-switch-deal%2F1100-6536984%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> currently has the best deal, offering the PS5 and Switch editions for just $28 (was $40).

The game was followed by two single-player sequels, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion--both released on Nintendo 64. The trilogy follows various warriors who take up the mantle of Turok--warriors who protect Earth and a parallel dimension known as the Lost Land from prehistoric monsters, high-tech super soldiers, and inter-dimensional aliens. The series also features the multiplayer deathmatch spin-off for N64, Turok: Rage Wars, and the prequel entry, Turok: Evolution, which launched on GameCube, PS2, Xbox, and PC in 2002.</p><p>A reboot set outside the original series, simply titled Turok, launched in 2008 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, but received middling reviews and poor sales. The series was largely considered dead until Nightdive's remaster trilogy, and now the franchise is set to return with its first all-new entry in almost 20 years with Turok Origins, a new third-person shooter reboot in development from Saber Interactive.

<figure data-uuid="cff39e6268983"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cff39e6268983/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its second patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> this month (<em>and perhaps the final update for the game in 2025</em>). This one is much smaller than the 1.4.0 update that dropped at the start of December.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect from Version 1.4.1, according to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world">official Nintendo support page</a>. It addresses an issue tied to controller disconnects and reconnects. If there is anything else going on behind the scenes with this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.4.1 (Released December 15, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player disconnects and reconnects a controller, the game may not progress as normal.
<ul>
<li>When this issue occurs, there are times when ghost data from Time Trials will be deleted without warning from “View Rankings.”</li>
</ul>
