<figure><a title="resleriana interview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/612c54c0bbac5/resleriana-interview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gust Corporation's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch"><strong>Atelier</strong></a> series has been on the go now since 1997. Yes, that 1997, the one that was ages ago.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is one RPG franchise that's never been a massive mover in the West. It didn't officially see the light of day over here until 2004, after which, I think it's fair to say, it spent quite a long time being so niche in its offerings that the idea of it really taking hold seemed far-fetched. It's all very low stakes, low-key, and incredibly fan-servicey.</p>
<p>However, it's been very interesting — speaking as someone who's reviewed many of the games on Switch 1 — to watch how quickly the Gust devs have, in the past six years or thereabouts, started to appeal to a different, bigger audience, particularly since the genuinely fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_ryza_secret_trilogy_deluxe_pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy released and went from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the first of Ryza's adventures, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_ryza_ever_darkness_and_the_secret_hideout" title="Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout">Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout</a>, was a slight but meaningful shift in the right direction, with a more explorable world, better mission structure, improved combat and a bunch of other Good Things™, by the time the final entry arrived in 2023, it felt like a proper full-on shift from often-difficult-to-parse fare and fan service to the sort of RPG that I (and I'm sure a bunch of other folk) want to get stuck into.</p>

<p>The core alchemy in these games has always been entrancing - this is some super-deep stuff for folks who like to get into ingredients. But this core is now hugely enhanced by modern open worlds, gloriously fun combat, and things that make for a full loop of gaming goodness, rather than what often felt like half of one.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all of this? Well, with the arrival of the next entry in the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, just around the corner, I got the opportunity to fire off some quick questions to none other than <strong>Junzo Hosoi</strong> (head of Gust Corporation and the game's general producer), <strong>Yasunori Sakuta</strong> (its development producer), and <strong>Yuki Katsumata</strong> (its director)...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (PJ O'Reilly):</strong> <strong>There are now a total of 27 Atelier games in this fantastic series, including [this one]. This huge number of games is then further divided into several sub-series - tell us how Atelier Resleriana fits into all of this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana stands as the 25th entry to the series (A25). As for this title, as it features events that take place at the same time ones in the first part of Atelier Resleriana (A25), it is considered within a part of A25, so we think of it as "A25-2".</p>

<p><strong>The first Resleriana took the very different form of a mobile Gacha game. What was the decision behind choosing this form of game, and how did it work out overall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> The mobile version of Atelier Resleriana was created with the intent to allow users who didn't know the Atelier series to casually get in touch with it and discover the appeal of the series. As a result, a lot of people within and outside of Japan mentioned that it became the reason they discovered the Atelier series and their interest in Resleriana is what made them decide to play other Atelier titles.</p>
<p><strong>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian is set within the same universe as the first Resleriana game. Can you tell us what the main differences are for this new adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yasunori Sakuta:</strong> This game takes place within the same setting as the previous Resleriana, so we partially used its system as reference. However, this is a completely new title, with a plot that takes place within the same timeframe as the mobile game, but in a different region.</p>
<p>For those who have played the mobile game, I'd think of it more as a "spin-off" of sorts. These players will be able to see connections to the original game, but those who have never played the mobile version can experience this game as a completely new title.</p>
<p><strong>Several Atelier games feature dual protagonists, such as the pair we find in this new game, and in others (Escha and Logy, for instance). What are the main attractions, benefits, and drawbacks of having dual protagonists in this type of adventure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> There hasn't been a male protagonist in the Atelier series in the last few years, so we wanted him to have an active role this time. That's how Rias and Slade were born.</p>
<p>With two protagonists we were able to fully illustrate their relationship, allowing for a more immersive experience. At the same time, if the balance between the two of them is not properly done, only one will be active and the other will not stand out. So that's quite a difficult situation to handle. It was quite challenging to keep the balance between the two protagonists throughout the story and game system.</p>

<p><strong>Is Atelier Resleriana planned to be a trilogy, or are there any future plans for this particular sub-series going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> We are focused on Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian and are not currently not thinking ahead. Of course, we are considering the next title for GUST, and there's the possibility of considering a third title for Resleriana.</p>
<p><strong>I am a huge fan of the Atelier Ryza series, which you were producer on. Those games felt like they were pulling the Atelier franchise into a more mainstream position, in how they dialled back fan-service and made the games more “modern JRPG”-like. Does Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian attempt to further the franchise in this way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> Thank you very much! I'm so glad to hear that!</p>
<p>For me, Ryza was a challenging title, as we wanted it to make more people play the Atelier series. And we continued that flow with Yumia. But, during the establishment of the series, I also understand that there are many different needs. For the development for this title, we wanted to make it a series that carefully envelops the turn-based aspects and a kind world.</p>

<p><strong>Atelier Yumia took the series to another level in terms of its open world. Can we expect something similar here, or is this a different sort of experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yuki Katsumata:</strong> This time, the field is not an open world but players will have a sectioned area to explore, similar to Atelier Sophie 2. Additionally, there are multi-level dungeons called "Dimensional Paths" around the field. The map's structure changes every time players enter them and the gimmicks and monsters also change slightly. The obtainable ingredients there are also better than the ones regularly found in the field, so players can also challenge themselves by re-entering them time and time again.</p>
<p><strong>[This] Atelier Resleriana is releasing on Nintendo Switch and a few other, more powerful platforms. Can we expect to see a Switch 2 port at any point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> As this title was developed for the Switch, we currently have no plans to port it to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of Switch 2, do you have one yet and, if so, have you any favourite games so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I do own a Switch 2! The recently released Donkey Kong Bananza is really fun. I return to a childlike state to destroy and release my stress!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, and something which has been causing a lot of controversy recently, AI and its many uses within the production of video games. How do you feel about using the likes of generative AI to help on projects, whether it be for background tasks or something like the art or writing in a project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junzo Hosoi:</strong> I feel the application of AI in game creation is incredibly vast. That being said, I think creators play an essential part of it, which is doing what AI cannot do, such as coming up with new ideas and bringing them to life. Moving forward, the balance between what we can leave up to AI and what creators come up and bring to life may become essential in game production.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Sincerest thanks to Junzo Hosoi, Yasunori Sakuta, and Yuki Katsumata from Gust Corporation for taking the time out to answer my questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian releases on Switch on 26th September.</em></p>

		<p>“I don't think enough people are across just how catastrophic an entire generation being raised on Roblox and Fortnite is going to be for the ENTIRE video game industry, not just the AAA end,” wrote <em>Aftermath</em> editor (and Sports! guest) Luke Plunkett on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lxgdgk5mrs2h?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Bluesky</u></a> recently. “These kids have no interest in playing or paying for anything else. And they're not ‘growing out of it.’”</p><p>I think this sentiment is common, and the angst and handwringing about what Roblox’s influence will mean for games is understandable given there are only two kinds of headlines:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107383/roblox-just-recorded-more-concurrent-players-at-once-than-all-of-steam/index.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox just recorded more concurrent players at once than all of Steam</u></a></li></ul><p>And…</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Roblox accused of being a 'hunting ground' for child predators as legal firestorm against gaming giant intensifies</u></a></li></ul><p>Roblox is huge in many senses of the word. It’s played by most children—and also, it's true, brings them a lot of joy! It happens almost every day in my own house with a nine-year-old and five-year-old and they are, like <em>most</em> kids who use Roblox, fine. But my approval of Roblox in the house doesn’t take away from noting it’s also undeniably dangerous, both in the exposure it gives to potential predators and the way it tries to pickpocket their money with trivial microtransactions.&nbsp;</p><p>You're also, in many ways, just describing navigating modern internet platforms. Similar concerns exist across many of them. It sucks.</p><p>The former gets the headlines, but I gotta say, the latter is what gives headaches. You cannot enter a Roblox “experience” without being aesthetically assaulted by pop-ups demanding that you pay a few dollars for basic parts of playing a video game, like checkpoints. Hey Congress, do something useful and block companies like Roblox from targeting kids like this, okay?</p><p>In our house, the policy is that we don’t pay for in-app transactions in Roblox. The kids aren’t even allowed to buy “robux” gift cards with their own money. We just don’t engage. There have been a few exceptions, like buying access to a special room full of exclusive clothes in the <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/who-makes-dress-to-impress-on-roblox?utm_source=publication-search"><u>popular (and well-designed, importantly) dress up game <em>Dress to Impress</em></u></a>. I also bought a cosmetic that let both kids look like a Labubu. Both were harmless. Both were exceptions.</p><p>Sorry, we gotta back up for a second and explain the “experience” thing. It’s hilarious.</p><p>Roblox is full of games. <em>Games</em>. But Roblox doesn’t call them games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440737/roblox-metaverse-game-experiences-apple-epic-trial/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>to skirt Apple’s App Store guidelines</u></a>. (What Roblox <em>users</em> define as a “game,” however, is the more important distinction.)</p><p>Bizarre, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, Roblox is going to completely change video game design. But it’s also a situation where we can replace “Roblox” with “<em>Minecraft</em>,” if you want. You can swap it for <em>Fortnite</em>, too. The trends match.</p><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are, to many young people, the equivalent of Steam. It’s not a game, it’s a platform. You log on to find out what the new trending thing is that everyone is playing, much like you’d open up Netflix and scroll through the service’s top 10 lists to find a decent time waster. The kinds of games that appear on these platforms often resemble the games that you and I obsess over, but under the surface, they’re operating in fundamentally different ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, a colleague asked me “Are Roblox games good games?”</p><figure><figcaption><span>The art style is awful. That, sadly, is unlikely to change. We must call for a revolution.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The answer is complicated and comes with bias towards past and current game design history as being forever lessons in the way video games should be designed. The way it will always be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s 25,000mAh Laptop Power Bank Drops Below Prime Day Pricing for Labor Day, Game Freely Without Outlets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets-2000621092</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25-000mah-laptop-power-bank-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-for-labor-day-game-freely-without-outlets.1283907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe someone challenged Anker to see just how much power and potential they could pack into a portable charger that’s only 6 inches long and weighs a scant 1.3 pounds. There’s really no other logical explanation for <strong>the Anker Laptop Power Bank, a 25,000mAh universally compatible behemoth with that can charge up to 4 devices at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Could this be the best portable charging device of all? Four-device capabilty, two built-in cables including one that doubles as a carrying strap, able to charge an M3 MacBook Air from zero to 50% in just 21 minutes, and the winner of an iF Design Award and a Red Dot Design Award in 2025? Finding out for yourself has never been easier now that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">Amazon’s running a limited-time 30%-off deal that drops the Anker Laptop Power Bank to just $94.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges Everything, Fast</h2>
<p>The Anker Laptop Power Bank can charge four devices in total, and even with three devices connected for some juice — including a laptop — all three get up to 100W at the same time. Two of the three USB-C ports have dedicated built-in cables, thus eliminating that mad scramble to find one when you’re on the go or in a hurry. One of those built-in USB-C cables extends up to 2.3 feet and can retract back into the body of the Power Bank, while the other doubles as a carrying strap. That’s a lot of cable-bending, so it’s good that Anker has built both cables to endure over 20,000 bends and retractions.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which device you’re looking to charge — the Anker Laptop Power Bank works with Mac and Windows laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wireless earbuds and headphones from Apple, Samsung, Google, or any brand that’s USB-C compatible, and also Steam Decks and other handheld gaming consoles. The fourth port is USB-A, so older devices aren’t getting left out.</p>



<h2>See It Work</h2>
<p>The hi-res real-time display screen at the front of the Anker Laptop Power Bank gives you all the information you could possibly need, including the output and input wattage for all four ports, remaining charge time, and the temperature and health of the Laptop Power Bank itself. The Laptop Power Bank takes its own temperature and those of the devices it’s connected to 3 million times per day, basically eliminating any chance of an excessive-heat-related failure. It’s TSA approved, so it’s the ultimate travel accessory to keep all of your devices up and running.</p>
<p>There’s a very solid case to be made that the Anker Laptop Power Bank is indeed the very best portable charger on the market. The combination of compact size, power output, number of devices it can charge, built-in cables, and safety measures is unparalleled, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">now during Amazon’s limited-time 30% off deal, so is the $94 price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong is the type of gaming event that doesn’t come around very often. If you’re excited to get your hands on the sequel and you own a Nintendo Switch 1 or 2 console, let’s check if you can buy Silksong.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a long time coming—and that’s one of the biggest understatements of 2025. It’s been in development for years, its rabid fanbase is desperate for the sequel, and by the end of its run, the original Hollow Knight had launched on multiple platforms. </p>



<p>With exclusivity, consoles, and hardware up in the air more than ever, you might be wondering if Hollow Knight: Silksong is on the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, both, or worst-case, neither!</p>

<figure><figcaption>Time to Switch things up. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still coming out for the original Nintendo Switch 1 console, despite its aging hardware.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo is remaining steadfast in its desire to support the Switch 1. Its 150 million-plus lifetime sales suggest there’s plenty of potential for any game to succeed on it. Not everyone upgrades to the new gen right away—which is understandable given the console’s considerable price tag.</p>



<p>This is why <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> deserves a Nintendo Switch 1 release. It may not run as smoothly as it will on other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-platforms-ps5-xbox-pc-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms—such as the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC</a>, for instance—but you should be able to enjoy the fruits of Team Cherry’s years of hard labor and toil.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 owners also get to play Hollow Knight: Silksong when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>It’s going to become a common theme moving forward. The Switch 2 will be the de facto home for Nintendo players. It’ll eventually become a case of wondering if the game is also coming to the first Switch instead of the Switch 2. We’ve already seen the likes of Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza skip out on the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This is only the beginning, I can assure you. On the other hand, the Switch 1 has plenty of life left, so don’t worry about missing out on big third-party games anytime soon!

                <p>The second incarnation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> debuted in 2013, and it's proven to be far more resilient than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">the version that arrived in 2010</a>. However, there's been discontent in the FF14 community lately over the removal of a popular mod, which led to the game's subsequent review-bombing on Steam. Now, director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the mod controversy with an appeal to players.</p><p>Yoshida's complete remarks were <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/1e4a8b0e8b84ea8dac61ae07af02e0c425de74aa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on FF14's official site</a>, and he requested that excerpts from his statement not be used by media outlets. But since his response was nearly 2,000 words, a concise recap is unavoidable. The issue started when Square Enix's lawyers sent a letter to modder DarkArchon regarding Mare Synchronos, a mod that allowed players' customized avatars to be visible outside of their own game. Once Mare Synchronos was removed at Square Enix's request, some fans <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/why-final-fantasy-xiv-fans-are-review-bombing-the-game-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their fury in the form of negative Steam reviews</a>.</p><p>Although Yoshida notes that he tolerates mods and has admiration for some fan-made creations, he's against mods that violate the game's intent or design in a negative manner. As a potential example, Yoshida noted that Square Enix could face legal consequences in some countries over nude character mods on display in the game. He also cited customized appearances that mimic paid content from from the game as an example of devaluing the services and collectibles that Square Enix sells to provide the revenue the game needs to remain financially viable.</p><p>Yoshida concluded his statement by saying he respects the tradition of modding in PC games, but he also requests that players do so while respecting the rules and integrity of FF14.</p><p>Late last year, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-free-to-play-will-kick-off-with-a-realm-reborn/1100-6527979/" data-ref-id="1100-6527979">expanded Final Fantasy 14 into the mobile realm</a> and released the game's fifth expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Dawntrail</a>. More recently, Yoshida has shared his intent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-support-on-ps4-looks-uncertain-but-yoshi-p-is-working-to-keep-it-going/1100-6534307/" data-ref-id="1100-6534307">to make sure Final Fantasy 14 remains compatible with PlayStation 4</a> as long as possible. However, he added that the limitations of the PS4 hardware may make that less feasible going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like always, this year's Gamescom was accompanied by a slew of new game announcements. Among the new games revealed during one of the most important video gaming events of the year was <a href="https://valormortis.game/">Valor Mortis</a>, a first-person soulslike in development by One More Level, the Polish development studio known for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> series. Having appreciated some of the features of the first entry in the series, such as the amazing mobility of the main character and its uncompromising approach, but not being particularly keen on how restrictive the entire experience felt, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the new game, which looked at a glance like another take on the formula with an underused setting in video games. My first impression of the game was not only completely off the mark but turned upside down completely when I finally got to spend more time with it.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, Valor Mortis is a first-person soulslike where players take on the role of William, a soldier in the Grande Armée brought back from the dead to continue serving Napoleon and save Europe from the mysterious plague that is destroying the continent, corrupting its inhabitants beyond repair. The premise alone is more than enough to set the game apart from every other souslike on the market, as not only the setting is really unique, but the first person gameplay seems to harken back to the days of the King's Field series back when FromSoftware was still refining the formula that the studio would make popular with Demon's Souls and the first Dark Souls.</p>



<p>Going the soulslike route with their new game, One More Level doesn't seem to have forgotten its past games, as Valor Mortis' smooth gameplay has some echoes of the Ghostrunner games' experience. Controlling William is extremely smooth, and the experience feels past paced without being on steroids like in the studio's older franchise, as combat still retails the heaviness and positioning focus of a soulslike. What I really enjoyed in Valor Mortis is how the first-person perspective is allowing the developer to nail how proper soulslike combat encounters should be - duels, or fights against a smaller number of enemies - going the opposite direction of many developers who prefer to overwhelm the player with huge enemy numbers using a combat system not really suited for big enemy numbers. </p>

<p>Following a few minutes of adjustments to the new perspective, I was immediately hooked to the experience, fighting enemies with short-range weapons and guns, unleashing special abilities, dodging, and parrying attacks with ease. Ultimately, the experience seems to strike a good balance regarding challenge, but as the game is still far from release, it is difficult to say how challenging Valor Mortis will actually be. In terms of level design, Valor Mortis also seems to be on point. The devasted battlefield where the Gamescom demo was set featured an intricate design with plenty of shortcuts and alternate paths, including some optional locations featuring powerful enemies, so it feels like One More Level is placing a decent amount of focus on traversal as much as it is on combat.</p>



<p>After taking down many corrupted soldiers and dying a few times in the process, I reached a massive corrupted soldier who served as the demo's final boss. Comprised of two phases, this boss fight put my limited knowledge of the Valor Mortis mechanics to the test, offering another look at how guns can be used to hit weakpoints and make some fights a little easier. After learning the boss' attack patterns, parrying and dodging accordingly, I managed to take it down with a few minutes to spare, which a member of the development team used to show me another enemy encounter where the player can use ranged weapons to destroy the cannon carried by the enemy to deal tons of damage. Sadly, my time with Valor Mortis ended right after this small additional showcase, leaving me hungering for more.</p>



<p>In a market becoming a little saturated with average soulslike that fail to capture what makes this sort of game so compelling, Valor Mortis feels like a breath of fresh air, as No More Level has shown, with this demo, to understand what a proper soulslike should feature. As such, the game was easily one of the best I had the pleasure of trying during this year's Gamescom, and one I really cannot wait to get my hands on the final game. Thankfully, some players won't have to wait until the game releases next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S to experience for themselves what makes Valor Mortis such a good game, as a playtest will be conducted soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-creature-collecting-auto-chess-game-honkai-nexus-anima.1283886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>sub-series, and if you're a fan of creature-collecting strategy games, then&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>is one you'll want to check out.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be building bonds with creatures made of Anima, unlocking abilities that embody their "unique concepts", and engaging in strategic combat using "diverse battle tactics".</p>

<p>By the looks of things,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-surprise-riot-makes-teamfight-tactics-permanent-league-of-legends-mode" rel="nofollow"><em>Teamfight Tactics</em></a>-style auto-chess game, but you'll also be tasked with exploring the world around you and uncovering "the mysteries of the protagonist's past", which is becoming a bit of a theme for HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=_L4YEtZf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=W-1RY9Zb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>brings&nbsp;<em>Teamfight Tactics</em>-style auto-chess combat and more to the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the combat will take the form of auto-chess-style strategy gameplay, the way you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>'s world looks a lot closer to traditional HoYoverse stuff; the trailer shows the player exploring a fully-fledged 3D world, engaging in minigames, and exploring with the aid of creature companions.</p>

<p>As such, this is probably gearing up to take the form of a classic HoYoverse-style grab bag of mechanics and gameplay styles, so if you're put off by the auto-chess angle, there'll almost certainly be something else in&nbsp;<em>Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>you'll love.</p>

<p>HoYoverse hasn't specified whether you'll need any prior knowledge of the previous&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>games (namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Impact 3rd</em>) to enjoy this one, but on the basis of&nbsp;<em>Star Rail</em>, it's unlikely you'll need to have played them beforehand.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>in action via the all-new gameplay trailer, which includes a look at things like combat, character creation, and world exploration, right here.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's coming to PC and iOS at some point in the future. If you want a chance to try it out, you can <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up for the closed beta right here</a>.</p>

(Because losing game data also sucks.) It’s two terabytes of plug-and-play, cross-platform-compatible peace of mind at an exceptional price.</p>

<h2>Fast and Secure</h2>
<p>The Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive works with USB 3.0 for super-fast file transfers of up to 120MB/s, and also with USB 2.0 on older devices. Either way, there’s no app or driver you need to install, and it doesn’t need any external power source. It’s strictly plug-and-play across all of its compatible platforms. The included 18-inch USB 3.0 cable gives you flexibility when it comes to where to set up the drive. (There’s really nothing worse than those cheap 4-inch cables packaged with other drives.)</p>
<p>The Seagate 2TB drive works with automatic backup apps like Apple’s Time Machine, and also as a drag-and-drop interface. If you want to take your data or game files on the go, the Seagate is literally pocket-sized, barely over a half-inch in thickness and exceptionally light, and built sturdily enough that you don’t have to worry about tossing it into a backpack on your way out the door.</p>



<h2>Backup for your Backup</h2>
<p>Things <em>do</em> happen, which is why you’re buying a reliable backup drive in the first place. And if some awful fate were to befall your Seagate drive, it comes with a year of Seagate’s Rescue Service, which depending on the severity of the damage would either repair the drive or extract the data from it and send it back to you on a new drive.</p>
<p>A smart and increasingly common practice is to copy your most precious and/or sensitive data and files onto one drive and store it in a safe location outside of your home, thus covering yourself in case of fire or other natural disaster. At the current $70 Amazon price for the 2TB Seagate Portable Hard Drive, having one emergency backup drive offsite and another to keep with your computer is a smart tactic. But having at least one fast, reliable backup drive is essential, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">head to Amazon now and grab a Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive while it’s on sale for just $70.</a></p>

During the GameCube era, Nintendo's console was home to numerous cult-classic horror games, and Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno wants to see more spine-tingling games released for Nintendo hardware.</p><p>"I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true," Babieno said to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4--were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a golden time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the ones to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now. We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cronos: The New Dawn Could Be The Beginning Of A New Era For Bloober Team</p>
      </div>
<p>Babieno added that Luigi's Mansion could be a good indicator of what fans can expect from the studio, as it gave players a cozy horror experience. The CEO says that there is a "huge possibility to repeat such an idea" in the future.</p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is one of only a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">handful of horror games that have been announced for the Switch 2</a>. Little Nightmares 3 looks like it'll spike heart rates--in a good way--but so far, it looks like Bloober's upcoming game is the only one that'll offer Switch 2 players a gory and unnerving experience as players travel through time and face off against nightmarish creatures that can merge with each other to gain a fleshy power-up.</p><p>The game will also be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches on September 3. "Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-tense-like-the-silent-hill-2-remake-but-with-a-twist/1100-6533465/">Cronos: the New Dawn preview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Aside from Grand Theft Auto VI, which was not featured at Gamescom 2025, Resident Evil Requiem is undoubtedly among the most hyped upcoming titles, and the German convention confirmed it. The first public hands-on of the ninth mainline chapter in CAPCOM's horror franchise convinced press and fans alike, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by the many Gamescom awards won</a>.</p>



<p>During Gamescom, CAPCOM also discussed Resident Evil Requiem in greater depth throughout a few interviews. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tooB3GgtU8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking with Gamesradar</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi explained that the new game will feel like a complete rollercoaster ride thanks to much greater extremes when it comes to all the classic Resident Evil elements of horror, tension, action, and release.</p>



<p><em>I think the two recent titles, Resident Evil 4 remake and Village, are more on the action side of the series in terms of the mixture of elements that they have. Resident Evil Requiem is something different. If I had to compare it to past titles, it's more along the lines of Resident Evil 7 or the Resident Evil 2 remake. You could call it old school Resident Evil, you know, with exploration and backtracking and that kind of thing. It does, of course, feature all the classic core pillars of Resident Evil features that everyone knows and loves, such as combat, exploration, puzzle solving, resource management of limited number of items, and we've given it our own spin this time for Resident Evil Requiem's game atmosphere.</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking then to Resident Evil 7 and 2, I think they reflect a typical game design that we have for this series, where you can't keep the horror tension to the max through the whole game, because it's quite exhausting. So, you need to have this dynamic pacing curve where you'll have a a very tense, horrific sequence, and then we give you a bit of a release or a catharsis from that and let you come down from that with more slightly peaceful exploration or some exciting comba,t and then we gradually bring you back up the horror part of the curve.</em></p>



<p><em>Again, that's the standard practice for Resident Evil. The difference this time is there's a new system that I can't quite get into yet, but if you think of the difference between the tension and the release being a certain size of wavelength, as it were, of that curve, I want to make the distance between those aspects bigger than ever before in the series, and it just becomes a complete roller coaster ride between the different aspects of the series. I'm very excited for people to eventually understand what I mean by that.</em></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to launch on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support path tracing</a> (the first RE Engine title to do so) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

			<p>A new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod now available for download addresses one of the most critical issues found in the PC version of the game: the 60 FPS framerate cap.</p>



<p>The Better Uncap FPS mod, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, allows users to cycle between different FPS targets between 30, 60, 100, 120, 144, and uncapped, with the uncapped option being the default. In addition, the mod also features an experimental audio sync fix, disables Depth of Field, Motion Blur, Refraction Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Lens Distortion, Film Grain, and Tonemapper for cleaner and sharper visuals and fully supports Lossless Scaling. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>

<iframe title="Better Uncap FPS v1.2 for METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypg27q2Xb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although this new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater mod definitely goes a long way in improving the game, the new options are not enough to completely fix a game released in a rather bad state. Some of its visual elements, such as particle effects, cause some massive performance drops, as highlighted on X by Benchmarking, so it definitely looks like developer Virtuos has <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">a lot of work ahead</a> to fix a game that deserved to be released in a much better state on all platforms.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another issue I noticed in this broken game is that whenever particles (especially dust) spawn near the camera, performance drops significantly. <br>The only solution I found is to disable these particles entirely using:<br>[SystemSettings]<br>fx.EnableNiagaraSpriteRendering=0<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MGSDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MGSDelta</a> <a href="https://t.co/BJClQuino6">pic.twitter.com/BJClQuino6</a></p>— BenchmarKing (@BMKing23) <a href="https://twitter.com/BMKing23/status/1961089149873623136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2025</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is good noise? “Golden” by Hunter/X from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em> is good noise. New episodes of Jamie Loftus’ <em>Sixteenth Minute (of Fame) </em>podcast is good noise. The guns firing in the bank heist scene of Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em> is good noise. What about bad noise? The couple on the bus with you arguing is bad noise. The turbine engines on flight is bad noise. Your cubicle’s neighbor punching away at their mechanical keyboard is bad noise. Wouldn’t it be swell if we could just cancel out the bad noise so we can focus in on the good noise? Well, you can do just that with <strong>the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise cancelling headphones.</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">For a limited time, Amazon has them for a whopping 43% off this labor day weekend. Normally priced at $348, you can currently pick them up for a solid $150 off.</a> That means you only have to pay $198.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones utilize digital noise cancellation to ensure you can hear each and every note or word clearly with no disruptive sounds from your environment coming through. Two microphones in each earcup work together to capture and eliminate surrounding noise when listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks, removing it in real time with the help of the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1.</p>

<p>The noise-cancelling tech also works to amplify your voice during calls. Five microphones work to deliver clear voice quality. They isolate your voice from any background noise so the person on the other end hears you and just you.</p>
<p>The headphones are designed for all day listening. You can expect a full 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. That’ll last you the whole workday, your commute, and beyond. If you ever find yourself having forgotten to charge it, no need to worry. Just plugging it in for 10 minutes will let you listen for a solid five hours.</p>



<h2>Multipoint Connection</h2>
<p>One standout convenience with the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones is that they can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at once. This is great as it allows you to be connected to your phone and a gaming console at the same time. It’s perfect for wanting to listen to your own music or podcasts through Spotify or something while playing a game on your Nintendo Switch. You can take a call without disconnecting and reconnecting anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">Through Labor Day weekend, you can grab yourself a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-cancelling headphones for $150 off.</a> The price is down to just $198 for a limited time.</p>

<p>With September stacked full of huge releases, knowing the amount of time it will take to complete games like Cronos: The New Dawn is important for you to plan effectively, so we’ve got the details on the game length.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn impressed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, but it lands in a packed release schedule that also includes the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong and Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to play multiple new releases in September, we’ve got everything you need to know on the game length of Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Hours to Beat Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dark journey. Image via Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cronos: The New Dawn will take around 18 hours to beat, according to the developer themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-developers-reveal-that-it-will-take-around-18-hours-to-beat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech Radar</a> in April, game directors Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba stated that the game was being completed by play tests in 18 hours. However, it was added that it could change as the team was still “balancing everything.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the game length has extended or shortened since, but it should give players a decent indication of how long it will take to progress through the main story. Depending on how you play, it could take up to 20 hours or as little as 16.</p>



<p>If you want to uncover every secret hidden in the game, it will naturally take you longer until you reach the end, but it’s all down to your playstyle.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cronos-the-new-dawn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cronos: The New Dawn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>The length of a full completionist run in Cronos: The New Dawn has not been stated, although players are encouraged to play through the main story at least twice.</strong></p>



<p>Replaying the game unlocks new skins, access to a higher difficulty option in New Game+, experimenting with the upgrade system, or trying out different approaches. Crucially, the developers have stated the game needs to be played “at least twice to understand most of it.”</p>



<p>Two playthroughs would total around 36 hours, giving you plenty of time to sink into the title, and it’s clear that replayability is a crucial feature.</p>



<p>How many times do you think you’ll play through Cronos: The New Dawn? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Have you heard of a game called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>? Silly question - the chances are you heard little else during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> week. This near fabled sequel finally got a release date after several long years of development, and large parts of our gaming world erupted in response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">The Gamescom queues to play Silksong</a> were enormous. History had happened. The 4th September - mark it in your diary.</p>
<p>But it wasn't good news for everyone. Announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates were suddenly in a difficult position. What should they do - hold ground and go against Silksong? Or move?</p>
<p>The choice was easier for some. Silksong, for all its legendary status, is an indie game made by a small team, so it will appeal particularly to players of indie games, especially tricky side-scrolling Metroidvanias. Blockbuster-styled games like moody action adventure Hell is Us should prove more resistant to Silksong-related audience leech, ditto shooters and other games without obvious crossover appeal. It's to indie games we should look to see the Silksong effect - and it didn't take long to be felt.</p>
<p>Swiftly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-delayed-due-to-hollow-knight-silksong-release-the-gta-of-indie-games">role-playing game Demonschool</a> and literal walking simulator Baby Steps lunged out of the way, delaying their releases by a couple of weeks. Then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> developer Toukana pushed the release of its new game Star Birds back a bit. With each new day came another alteration, so instead of listing each Silksong-related delay game by game, I thought I'd round them up. I thought I'd take a closer look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2025-video-game-release-schedule#section-9">the 2025 release schedule</a> and investigate what has and hasn't moved, and there was a lot more movement than I expected.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The headcounts of both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev teams continue to steadily climb, as the two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> inch closer to our fingertips. Meanwhile, CD Projekt have confirmed that their research division are still busy deciding what the mysterious original game codenamed Project Hadar will look like.</p>
<p>All of these details, plus some Nintendo Switch stuff we've avoided hearing by sticking our mouse and keyboard-focused fingers in our ears, were revealed in the Polish publishers' <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-first-half-of-2025/">financial report</a> covering the first half of 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, the big guns. As outlined by the handy chart below, The Witcher 4 had 422 people working on it as of April 30 and saw that number grow to 444 people by the close of July, while Cyberpunk 2 has hopped over the three digit threshold in that time, going from 96 chooms to 116. Oh bugger, sorry for dropping the c-bomb, that Cyberpunk playthrough I'm still on with is clearly getting to me.</p>
<p>"Our recruitment efforts have significantly sped up over the last three months, and as a result the total number of talented developers working across our projects has grown by 10%, reaching almost 800 people," CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski explained in a presentation to investors. It's worth noting that this current growth follows the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-announces-another-batch-of-layoffs-affecting-around-100-employees">laying off staff</a> back in 2023, with some remaining workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-staff-form-union-after-layoffs-and-want-everybody-in-the-industry-to-join">deciding to unionise as a result</a>.</p><div>

<p>With Cyberpunk 2 now having fully moved from the research section of CD Projekt's books into the development section - it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">in pre-production</a> for a little while now - the mysterious Project Hadar's the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/management-board-report-on-cd-projekt-group-activities-in-h1-2025-1.pdf">most expensive research project</a> CD Projekt have on the go. While we have some sense now of The Witcher 4, Cyberpunk 2, and Molasses Flood's Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, Hadar remains an enigma several years on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-are-making-a-new-witcher-trilogy-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-and-a-brand-new-ip">initial announcement back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>We know it's going to be an original story, and some <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/">job listings</a> have suggested that it's an action RPG with melee combat. Nowakowski's also been <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758">weirdly specific in ruling out</a> that it's a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan". Aside from that, shrug emoji. Though, with Hadar's 22 person strong team now looking to be the main focus of CD projekt's research department, the company's investors are clearly as curious for more info on it as we are.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/transcript-h1-2025-earnings.pdf">call accompanying these financials</a>, one of them rather bluntly asked whether any decisions regarding the game's future would be made by the end of this year or 2026. Nowakowski seemed a bit taken aback by the idea of sharing more so soon.</p>
<p>"Hadar is still basically an IP concept, so not a game development project yet," he responded. "We’re working on the game’s story, its background – so to say; there is some prototyping going on in terms of gameplay, because it’s hard not to do that when the end goal is to make a video game – but I’m not sure what you mean by 'decisions' – I mean, as in to progress to development, or whether we’re going to make [a game] or not…? We want to make this IP happen, so that decision is sort of made in terms of – when we’re going to go into development, we will announce it in due time, I think."</p><p>You could argue it's been a bit of a strange move for CD Projekt to have announced Hadar at the same time they did the fresh Witcher trilogy and Cyberpunk 2, if they were still going to be at this early a stage with it nearly three years down the line. Then again, that kind of transparency's great for us journos and has probably helped CD Projekt recruit folks to work on Hadar. My money's on it being a Keanu Reeves gacha game with 4X strategy elements and a roguelike mode based around the concept of the word 'woah'.</p>

<p>You might think the last thing a FromSoftware game needs is the option to make a game harder. Elden Ring Nightreign is getting just this with the new Deep of Night setting, which ups the difficulty across the board.</p>



<p>FromSoftware’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-all-elden-ring-nightreign-remembrances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a unique twist on traditional Elden Ring. It factors in battle royale elements, and there’s an emphasis on speed and succinctness. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> have been thrust into the game over time, and now a new update is preparing to make Nightreign harder than ever. Yay.</p>



<h2 id="h-deep-of-night-mode-to-make-elden-ring-nightreign-more-difficult">‘Deep of Night’ Mode to Make Elden Ring Nightreign More Difficult</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beating the first night took long enough. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re a sadist who loves Souls games and finding new ways to challenge yourself, you’re in luck. <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-ChaosMode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bandai Namco</a> has shed light on Deep of Night: “The enemies that appear are stronger than usual.”</p>



<p>The new game mode option arrives on September 11, giving you plenty of time to prepare. Bandai Namco describes the new setting as a “High-difficulty challenge mode&nbsp;designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times.”</p>



<p>In short, if you’ve mastered Nightreign and can beat all the nights and all the bosses upside down with a blindfold on, you’re probably the person that Deep of Night caters to. The setting also adds new Relics and Gear exclusive to Deep of Night.</p>



<p>A previously hinted-at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-could-be-getting-an-endless-ranked-mode-datamine-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless option</a> also accompanies the update. This allows you to keep going until you die, and will really test your ability.</p>



<p>Does Deep of Night sound like your sort of thing? Is making Elden Ring Nightreign harder high up on your wishlist? You know what to do; let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-cronos-the-new-dawn-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1283829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September’s stacked release schedule will certainly put a strain on the wallets of gamers worldwide, so it’s natural to wonder if titles like Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn lands in a packed period of releases alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, but our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> at Gamescom certainly caught our eye.</p>



<p>If you’ve not pre-ordered Cronos: The New Dawn yet and want to know if you can save money with a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Cronos: The New Dawn on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Cronos: The New Dawn will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is not a first-party Xbox title, which would mean automatic inclusion in the service, and there hasn’t been any announcement of the title being added to the catalog.</p>



<p>Although we’re still waiting for the first wave of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> titles for September to be announced, big releases like Cronos are usually announced well in advance. The biggest indicator is the Xbox Store, which would have a ‘Coming to Game Pass’ badge by the purchase button.</p>



<p>As we’ve had no news to suggest otherwise, and the Xbox Store itself doesn’t advertise a Game Pass drop, don’t expect to see this title drop in the catalog.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cronos-the-new-dawn-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Cronos: The New Dawn Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no indication of whether Cronos: The New Dawn will eventually come to the Game Pass service, though it cannot be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Bloober Team’s Layers of Fear was previously available in Xbox’s now retired Games with Gold service in March 2019, showing that the developer does have a previous relationship with Microsoft. On top of this, The Medium was also included in Game Pass in the past, so there’s certainly a track record that could be followed.</p>



<p>Naturally, though, any potential release for Cronos: The New Dawn on Game Pass would come later down the line, with the initial intention of maximizing sales. Eventually, it could open the door for a new audience to enjoy the game in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is a breakout hit for developer Saber Interactive, selling over 7 million copies in less than a year. As the game approaches its first anniversary, and with the hotly anticipated Patch 10 imminent, development chief Tim Willits has a lot to be happy about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has not been on any streaming service,” Willits told me in an interview at gamescom 2025. “You want to play it, you got to buy it. And it's just rocking and rolling. And it wasn't overpriced. It wasn't overscoped. It wasn't over-designed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Space Marine 2 was not a guaranteed success. No video game is. In fact, things were looking ropey when Saber and publisher Focus Entertainment <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-to-second-half-of-2024">announced a significant delay to the game</a>, from 2023 to the second half of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This, Willits says, was the “smartest” move Saber has ever made - and you can see why. Space Marine 2 is easily the biggest Warhammer 40,000 video game of all time, impressing veteran fans of the famous grimdark tabletop game and newcomers alike. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-sees-highest-concurrent-player-peak-ever-for-a-warhammer-40000-game-on-steam">Huge player numbers followed</a> as well as record sales. As Willits told me last year, Space Marine 2 changed everything for Saber, and it wasn’t long before the inevitable Space Marine 3 was announced. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-reveals-content-plan-for-patch-10-right-up-to-2026s-patch-15-including-new-weapons-a-new-class-and-much-more">A full second year of content for Space Marine 2 is also in the works</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Space Marine 2, if you remember, we actually delayed that,” Willits said. “It was f***ing worth it! And that was the smartest thing we ever did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on Space Marine 2's first year, Willits admitted it is an ongoing challenge to release enough DLC, both free and premium, to satisfy fans who are always hungry for more content. He pointed to the free horde mode, dubbed Siege, as a particular high point of Space Marine 2’s first year. “Can you name any giant AAA games that release free modes within months after the game?” Willits wondered. “The team is passionate about it. They're super Space Marine nerds, and fan appetite for it is over the top.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber, who evolved its impressive zombie tech for prior game World War Z and applied it to the Tyranids for Space Marine 2, was prepared to provide DLC post-launch, Willits said. “We learned our lesson in World War Z. So when World War Z came out, we were unprepared to be honest. We were like, ‘Oh my god, this is a success. Go!’ And so we were way more prepared. We had people working on stuff a year plus before we released, because we knew. We knew. And we learned our lesson. But you're right, feeding the machine is hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 is certainly set for plenty of DLC in its second year, but will it get a story expansion? Or will fans have to wait until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing">Space Marine 3</a> comes out to find out what happens next to Titus and friends? “I mean we have some plans, but we have to work with Focus to get the right announcement,” Willits teased. “Nothing is off the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2’s success has even positively impacted the development of other Saber games, and given the company the confidence to delay again knowing how beneficial it can be in the long run. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a>, for example, was delayed out of this year and into early 2026, and Willits is perfectly calm about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Space Marine 2 was so successful for us that we wanted to make sure that we didn't rush out Toxic Commando immediately after that,” he explained. “And we wanted to make sure that the team had resources and the time and the testing. We've done multiple beta tests, we've got normal people playing it. We had sign-up a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is one of the great things about Saber. We manage our business well and we do not over scope, over design and bloat our teams or our projects, which then allows us to be like, ‘Hey, you know what? Let's actually spend a little more time on Toxic. Space Marine's doing great, we're making content for that. People love it.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because gamers are smart. They always know when a game is rushed or like, ‘You could have done better if you’d spent a little more time with it.’ So we are in a position because of how we make games and how we do work, and that gives us the flexibility and freedom to focus on making sure the games are as good as they can be. So yes, it's a little longer past Space Marine, but I think it'll be much better.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/image1-wide-lmcl29nu75-1756463334899.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hats off to Titus and Space Marine 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The last week of August is always a pretty barmy one for me. Coming back from Gamescom means I have to write up tons and tons of previews, and so I’ve been shouting about everything from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/crushed-in-time-brings-grabbing-and-slapping-to-the-classic-point-click/">Crushed in Time</a> to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/25/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-preview-world-war-z-with-a-side-of-roadcraft/">Toxic Commando</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/24/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-real-time-battles-are-mega/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> in the past seven days.</p>
<p>But I have had some other things on the go. I played through the opening of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, which is slick, empowering and satisfying so far, I got <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5-review/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> downloaded, and The Rogue Prince of Persia is also ready to go when I find some time this weekend. I’m looking forward to both!</p>

<p>And with good reason, because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review/">The Rogue Prince of Persia is easily one of the best roguelites of the year</a>, in Ade’s estimations, but he’s not limiting himself to just two dimensions as he’s also been playing plenty of Marvel Rivals and is getting up to an acceptable level – “I’m certainly not an embarrassment anymore as one of my supposed teammates so nicely pointed out.”</p>
<p>But Ade absolutely buried the lede on this one, leaving it to Laura to reveal that the pair of them are now engaged as of last weekend! Congratulations! This, she says, somewhat eclipsed her achievements in Islanders: New Shores, where she reached level 20, and made a start on Sword of the Sea.</p>

<p>Aran regaled us with tales of his musical skiing escapades in Fresh Tracks, which “honestly may be my pick for soundtrack of the year when awards season hits.” Alongside that, he’s been playing Wild Hearts, making his way past the chapter 3 boss thanks to a bit of weapons and armour upgrade grinding.</p>

<p>Something quite remarkable has happened this week, as Tuffcub followed up his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/herdling-review/">Herdling</a> review by installing a game on his PC for the first time! I mean, it’s Destiny: Rising, so it’s actually a mobile game that’s running in an Android emulator, but he’s got his DualSense plugged in and working and is having a pretty good time of it. So yes, Tuff is back to playing Destiny again… and he says, “Honestly, I think this might kill off Destiny 2. It’s Destiny, but all brand new and that’s what everyone wants.”</p>
<p>That’s got Jim a little curious about how tricky it might be to set up – it’s literally advertised on the Destiny: Rebirth site that you can do this – especially since he’s just finished the main campaign of Far Cry 5, just as he was starting to tire of its open world. He did play a bit of the Hours of Darkness DLC, though.</p>
<p>Miguel has been playing the Japanese indie FPS The Citadel, alongside his usual Fortnite and Helldivers 2, plus a review of Shuten Order which you’ll get to read a bit later today. Meanwhile, Gamoc polished off a review playthrough of Echoes of the End, and snuck in an hour of Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>It’s been all post-apocalyptic in Steve’s world this week, as he returned to the cutest vision of this in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Switch 2 Edition and frosty DLC</a>. He’s also been mushing fluffy creatures through The Herdling, but is weighing up whether to play Shinobi when there’s Silksong on the way…</p>

<p>And finally, Dom’s been away again, and has been sneaking in a bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/25/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-review/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> in moments of downtime. He also rather enjoyed playing through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/29/the-knightling-review/">The Knightling</a> and has made a start on our Madden 26 review. Is it good? “So far… yes?”</p>
<p>Now, what have you played?</p>

<p>Patch 1.2 offers up a healthy batch of fixes and improvements, including gameplay tweaks, visual updates, and quality-of-life additions such as a separate save slot for quick saves. It's all very welcome, and should go toward making an already-excellent game even better.</p>
<p>We gave System Shock 2 a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">9/10 in our recent review</a>, highlighting the amazing story and explorative elements, but noting that the combat could feel slightly dated at times.</p><div><figure data-videoid="gbGX-nnXc-E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbGX-nnXc-E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d3c45vqmwyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbGX-nnXc-E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta was a huge success for EA and Battlefield Studios. A lot was learned about the next mainline BF game. If you think you can’t play Battlefield 6 again until October, think again—Battlefield Labs has returned.</p>



<p>Before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a>, there was Battlefield Labs. EA’s new initiative is to incorporate player feedback more than ever before. We all complained vociferously about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a>‘s shortcomings, and it looks promising as EA clearly doesn’t want to make the same mistake twice.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-sign-up-for-battlefield-6-labs">You Can Sign Up For Battlefield 6 Labs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Start playing again right now. Image Via Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battlefield Communications <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a> announced on August 29 that “Battlefield Labs Resumes.”</p>



<p>The community update explained that you can register your interest again—and we have an in-depth guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> so you can play and test BF6.</p>



<p>It also explained: “The end of the Open Beta now provides us with the opportunity to return to Battlefield Labs play sessions. This time around, these sessions may occur at more varied intervals as we target finalizing the launch balance and features of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>A significant amount of new content is being added to Battlefield Labs that was previously unplayable. The Portal function is being added to Labs—albeit a basic and stripped-back version—and the announced Server Browser functionality is also included in the latest round of testing.</p>



<p>The development team is also using this test to “Determine the official setting for Hardcore mode, and we look forward to working with players to define it.”</p>

<p>Don’t expect the Battlefield news to stop between now and release. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-most-advanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 PC Trailer</a> blew our minds, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-battlefield-6-camos-have-leaked-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first Battlefield 6 Camos have leaked</a>.</p>



<p>Let us know how excited you are for Battlefield 6 through the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>, featuring gaming conversations every day.</p>

The content available will be in various stages of production, including items in alpha state, which may result in less polished and/or unstable builds. This allows the development team to balance and make adjustments much faster as it "shapes the future of the game with the community to shape the future of the game."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/bf-labs-resumes-update-1756460090903.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Battlefield Portal user interface.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is the driving force behind many of your favorite video games released in the last few years, but it largely flies under the radar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> are just a few of the many games that were and continue to be supported by Virtuos, one of the largest independent video game companies in the world with over 20 studios globally employing about 4,000 staff. Still, the average gamer probably doesn’t know Virtuos exists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s starting to change though, with Virtuos’ profile rising with each new release. Oblivion Remastered is perhaps Virtuos’ biggest project yet, and its heavy involvement with its development was made a key part of the game’s announcement by Bethesda. Meanwhile, CD Projekt livestreams feature members of the Virtuos development team. Looking ahead, Ken Levine’s BioShock follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, and Riot’s League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a>, will both come out with Virtuos’ help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it has not all been plain sailing. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Virtuos laid off approximately 7% of its global workforce</a>, or around 270 staff. In a statement, Virtuos said it was "evolving to meet the changing needs" of its partners and the wider video games industry. Most of the layoffs affected Virtuos’ Asian workforce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a wide-ranging interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux discussed the company’s history, its recent projects, and what it’s hoping to achieve in the future. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has gone a long way to putting Virtuos on the map this year, was a big part of our chat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/virtuos-gilles-langourieux-landscape-1756412895462.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos’ expertise when it came to remasters (Batman, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls Remastered) meant it was a natural part of the conversation around Oblivion’s return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We managed to convince Todd Howard and his team that we could do it,” Langourieux began. “He had known us for a while. And then how does it work? You prove what you're capable of during a pilot phase. You deliver a convincing vertical slice or pilot. You align with the team at Bethesda on what they believe is the level of quality or detail required to meet their audience goal, and you continue all the way to final ship.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtuos developed Oblivion Remastered using Unreal Engine 5. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes went down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos knew it had to use a new engine for Oblivion Remastered to bring the classic RPG up to date in terms of graphics and performance, but also retain the original engine so veteran fans would recognize Oblivion’s gameplay. As Todd Howard himself described it, Bethesda was keen for the Oblivion remaster to have some of that “old charm.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We realized that one of the solutions would have to be to combine the original engine with a new engine. Virtuos happens to have a long experience working with Unreal,” Langourieux said. “We've done a number of projects like this where we combine — it's called engine pairing — we pair two engines to work together so that the gameplay comes from the original engine, but the rendering and the new modern bells and whistles come from the new engine. And our experience doing that, our experience with Unreal, was one of the things we had to bring to the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, hundreds of artists were mobilized to work on Oblivion Remastered to “nail” the Oblivion art style while also modernizing it. Virtuos had its studio in Paris lead the project, making technical, design, and artistic choices about the game, with the help of other Virtuos studios. At Bethesda, a small team under the direct supervision of Todd Howard monitored Virtuos’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At peak, around 400 people at Virtuos worked on Oblivion Remastered. This was a true AAA development effort spread out across a number of years. The end result was a successful release, a video game played by over 9 million people at this point, and a (largely) impressed fanbase. Virtuos itself was made a part of Bethesda’s official Oblivion Remastered announcement video, which Langourieux appreciated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sometimes when you tackle these kinds of projects, you worry about talking about a new developer because you're worried that new developer name might not resonate so well with the audience,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They put their money where their mouth is by supporting us very transparently and openly, and that has given us more visibility than other projects have. So credit to them for that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater… what’s next? With all sorts of rumors swirling around about more Bethesda remasters, could Virtuos be helping out with, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-success-ex-bethesda-dev-expects-a-fallout-3-remaster-would-significantly-improve-the-not-good-gun-combat">a Fallout remaster of some description?</a> Of course, Langourieux won’t name names, but did talk generally about what Virtuos has up its sleeve, and teased “similar” titles to Oblivion Remastered coming from the company in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I won't be able to share specifics,” he began, “but what I can say is that you've seen what we're capable of for a big, impactful remaster like Oblivion. You can expect more similar titles to come out of Virtuos in the coming years. And you can also expect to see us involved in expanding the life of large-life titles. Those would be two directions that I'm super excited about.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Virtuos break out of its support act status and make an original IP of its own? Langourieux seems happy with where his company is at right now, insisting “not everyone aspires to be the rockstar.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a lot of ambition,” Langourieux said. “We've built one of the largest, most stable game developers in the business, and we intend to continue doing that. We've done it by being very clear about what we're good at and how we can serve our clients in the industry. And there's a lot of ambition with that. Not everything is about being the rockstar. Not everyone aspires to be the rockstar. We're playing a different role."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>A "substantial number" of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta players were playing on or around the minimum recommended specs, according to technical director Christian Buhl.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Bulh broke down some user data for the initial wave of PC players who hopped into the game earlier this month, stating that of the "millions of players" who were jumping in, a sizable portion of them were doing so on lower-end hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking about some of the lengths Battlefield Studios and EA went to to ensure the game was playable by those on older setups, Buhl stated: "We built maps, and had to go to our artists and tech artists to adjust these maps so they were more performant. We've put in a lot of effort across the board to make sure these performance targets were set, and whether you're on min spec or ultra spec you're going to get the experience we're targeting."</p>

<p>When asked how important it is to serve minimum spec players at a time when PC hardware is getting more expensive, due to bloated prices or general economic challenges right now, Buhl responded by saying: "Min spec is certainly one of our most important specs [...] it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective - we want as many people as possible playing the game."</p><p>Buhl continued with an anecdote from earlier in the game's development: "We did a lot of analysis, we did tests on the game on a wide range of hardware above and below our minimum and recommended specs. We figured out what we can hit, what we need to hit from a business perspective, and that was to capture a wide audience on PC. It's been super critical."</p>
<p>When asked what percentage of players were playing at or around that min spec, Buhl could not recall the exact number,  dubbing it a "meaningful percentage". He also noted a number of players below the minimum spec, emphasizing the existence of this group.</p>
<p>In a follow up email after the interview, EA PR would not provide the exact number, pointing to Buhl's prior statement that it was a "substantial number" of players</p>
<p>The current state of affordable computing in the USA, Battlefield 6's primary market, is one of turmoil. Not only has a cost-of-living crisis made the price tag on high end hardware unpalatable for a sizable number of gaming enthusiasts, ongoing political policy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W_mSOS1Qts&amp;ab_channel=GamersNexus">has had a drastic impact on international trade</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paramount-seeking-rights-to-make-a-call-of-duty-movie-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1283778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been reported that Paramount is seeking the rights to adapt Call of Duty into a movie, with the film reportedly being a ‘priority’ for the 110-year-old picture production firm. Nothing has been confirmed beyond this, and it’s not yet known in what form a potential Call of Duty movie would surface.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the news, with some stressing that it’s not the right time for a Call of Duty movie and others wondering if the film would include ‘Beavis and Butthead skins’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-a-call-of-duty-movie-being-made">Is a Call of Duty Movie Being Made?</h2>



<p>Before the Microsoft x Activision Blizzard acquisition, rumors regarding a Call of Duty movie were circulating. In a recent report from <a href="https://puck.news/author/matthew-belloni/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Puck News</a>, the claim surfaced along with a note that a Call of Duty film is a high priority for Paramount’s new leadership team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sentiment surrounding the news has been pretty tough, with fans suggesting it could be ‘another Borderlands movie’, which was released in 2024 to a woeful reception. Other Call of Duty fans have posted screenshots of the countless ‘war flicks’ we’ve received over the last few decades, stating that they’re <strong>all </strong>Call of Duty movies, in theory.</p>



<p>Paramount might go the route of creating something original, but for it to be a <strong>Call of Duty movie</strong>, it might need to follow a path already established by the game franchise. For instance, a movie-based replication of the Modern Warfare series might do well because it’s already so cinematic, but then it lacks originality.</p>



<p>What would you like to see from a Call of Duty movie? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly a year on from the launch of MachineGames' brilliant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the studio is back with an additional chapter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants">The Order of the Giants</a>, which arrives on September 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who enjoyed the base game's blend of puzzle-solving and fisticuffs, this fresh DLC adds more of what you love — and takes a novel approach to tuning its difficulty, based on your experience with the Great Circle so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN last week at Gamescom, creative director Axel Torvenius and lead game designer Zeke Virant explained how The Order of the Giants will smartly adapt its combat to suit both new and veteran players, due to the DLC's addition within the base game's narrative, branching off of its Rome location. And while the pair remained tight-lipped on word of an Indiana Jones sequel, discussion was still had about MachineGames' intention for the overall narrative of the game — and how it's sometimes best to leave players keen for more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The conventional way of doing DLC is to add something that stands after, or a miniature game on the side," Torvenius begins, "but we didn't really feel that that was the best for our game." He pauses, smiles. "Though it would've been the easiest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can tell you we had a lot of struggles or challenges with the technical side of things, making sure that people's existing save states [work]. The systems we had in place did not fully support us just splicing in a lot of new content in the middle of the game. So there was a lot of hard work from engineers and programmers and also on the design side. It was not an easy thing to do, but we felt it was the best to do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who are yet to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the idea is that Order of the Giants simply adds onto the game's already generous Rome section, with additional areas outside and underneath the Vatican to explore. And for players who have finished the game already, who will likely be familiar with dipping back into previous areas to hunt down remaining side-missions and collectibles via their journal, the DLC simply acts as a huge new side-quest to pursue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The integration makes the experience the most seamless," Torvenius continues, "and makes it feel like it's really expanding on the existing content. There was a balance, because obviously the DLC is its own completely standalone adventure. So there are hooks and the red threads between the main storyline and the DLC, but the DLC story does not impact the main story, even if the DLC story will give you a deeper understanding of some elements. So it was absolutely not the easiest [way to do DLC], and maybe not the smartest, but the best."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, though, players still finding their feet in the Vatican's sunny courtyards will have a different experience approaching Order of the Giants' content than those who have played another 40 hours, seen Indy's journey to the end and buffed up their archeologist with all sorts of upgrades and bonuses. And it's because of this, Virant says, that MachineGames was forced to get even smarter under the game's hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players who are at the end of the game don't need to worry about the difficulty [being too easy] as actually we have a new system in place where players are dynamically scaled based on how far they progressed," Virant explains. "We know a lot of players are coming back from the endgame and would like to have a continuation of that difficulty, especially if they have health upgrades and a lot of abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We tried a few different things, but the one that was simplest and actually just what felt right was that if you've progressed to the Vatican but you haven't gotten to Giza yet, we keep it on a first tier of difficulty. If you've gotten to Giza, then we adjust it up to a second tier. And then once you've gotten to Sukhothai, we adjust to a third tier. From there we [can tune] the different amount of combos enemies can use, different amounts of health and also how many will gang up on you at the same time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a smart system, though one which need not come into play at all during the DLC's first hour, as Indy kicks off his new adventure with some impressive-looking new adventuring and puzzle sections, set just outside the bounds of the base game's existing area. It's here that Indy meets Father Ricci, a priest obsessed with the legend of a secret chamber that houses a giant helmet - something that immediately sparks our hero's interest. (Brilliantly, Father Ricci also has a pet parrot, Pio, who rather steals the show. Torvenius confirmed that while the parrot speaks, this is not another turn from the talented Troy Baker, and is instead another voice actress who provides the parrots' voice and much of its chirping sounds.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC's focus on the main game's race of giants, otherwise known as the Nephilim Order, will likely pique the intrigue of fans who enjoyed piecing together their story during the Great Circle's campaign. Sadly, the late Tony Todd, who played Locus, was not able to contribute to the DLC — though Torvenius said his presence "would have been amazing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To some extent this was never really about telling the background story of Locus as a character," he said. "Even though for me personally, I would've loved to play a game that was where you just play as Locus for 15 hours on all of his grand adventures. That would've been interesting. But this was more about deepening the story of the tribe of the giants and the Nephilim Order. And obviously Locus is part of that since he's part of the race, but it's more about the origins and the mystery of it and how it connects with the Vatican and the streets of Rome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked whether players will learn everything there is to know about the giants before the end of the DLC, or whether MachineGames was purposefully keeping some elements of their story secret, Torvenius remained coy. "Yes and no," he replied. "I would say I think absolutely this will help for people that have played through the main game, and when they have played the DLC in addition to that, they will get a deeper understanding of the mystery around the Nephilim Order. But there are things that maybe are to some extent left unanswered, though the majority of it I think starts to paint a pretty good picture."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/giants-dlc-cavern-4k-1756390200862.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Was this secrecy a desire to hold some story elements back for use in the future, I wondered, or simply a decision not to explain too much — the Midichlorians effect — of something that could otherwise remain a cool mystery? "In my mind, both as a consumer myself but also as a creator, I enjoy when maybe sometimes everything isn't explored," Torvenius responded. "Sometimes there will be still like a fog of war on the map that is best left unexplored.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have internally fleshed it out completely," he continued, discussing the lore of the giants. "I could write a blurb that explains how everything is connected, but would that be fun?" <em>Yes</em>, I say, to which Torvenius laughs. "We are always working towards giving players the sensation they have figured it out and it should make sense when it's all connected. But for me it's always important to make sure you slowly get a bigger picture without saying too much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Torvenius and Virant, Order of the Giants has been a challenging but enjoyable victory lap for one of 2024's most widely-praised games. Development on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle began amid the height of Covid lockdowns, with the studio forced to collaborate via Microsoft Teams. For the DLC, however, its developers have been together throughout, able to build on what has come before, in the knowledge they're working on something that is already beloved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The overall quality of the DLC is absolutely on par and in some instances higher than main game," Torvenius concludes. "For people that love the Great Circle and the world of Indiana Jones that MachineGames built, this is more of that. It's really for them. And if you haven't played the base game, we are really hoping that this is a great opportunity for people wanting to play. It's been a great adventure doing it, a lot of hard work, but it's been fun to see. Sometimes you work on a game for many years and towards the end there can almost be a bit of fatigue, or you're a bit exhausted. But when production really geared up on the DLC, people were still energized. I think that passion for Indiana Jones shines through, and we are extremely proud of it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Most of the changes address bugs or other issues that have come up since the game officially launched on August 14. It's also introducing Nike Rivalries, a new feature that will bring "community pride" to some of the most famous rivalries in the league.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA</a>, Nike Rivalries is part of a new four-year deal between Nike and the NFL that will "celebrate football's most storied rivalries" with customized uniforms that represent their respective cities. Each iteration of Nike Rivalries will focus on teams from two different divisions, and this year's subjects are the AFC East and NFC West.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728"></a><figcaption>Players from the NFC West and AFC East show off their custom looks in Nike Rivalries.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg"></figure><p>EA also announced that the Madden NFL 26 update will introduce a customized playbook that was created in collaboration with retired quarterback Kurt Benkert. The playbook is called Benkert's Dimes, and it's available in Play Now when selecting playbooks.</p><p>The remaining issues addressed in this update are largely specific to certain plays or situations. Additionally, EA notes that it will address a few other fixes in later updates, including the Class Import Process incorrectly modifying player body types, the inability to take players off of the IR list, and nose tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</p><p>The complete list of changes in Madden NFL 26's first update can be found below:</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Cover 2 Tampa - The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3x1 formations.</p><p>Cover 2 Hard Flats - Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</p><p>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</p><p>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms - Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</p><p>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</p><p>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</p><p>Addressed a visual issue around the previous play graphic obscuring the offensive play call formation.</p><h3>Franchise</h3><p>Addressed our UI Transitions surrounding the Player Card. Reducing the transition time it takes to go into the Player Card.</p><p>Dev Notes: This current fix only addresses going into the Player Card. Our resolution for exiting out of the player card back to the Franchise Main Menu will be in our next TU.</p><p>Resolved an issue allowing commissioners to send multiple league invites simultaneously.</p><p>Addressed an issue that prevented Edge Players from adding Pass Rushing Traits</p><p>Addressed an issue during the Draft where the Draft Board was improperly transparent, showing through to the background.</p><h3>Title Update</h3><p>Class Import Process incorrectly modifying Player Body Types, specifically Offensive Linemen.</p><p>Players on IR unable to be peeled off the IR list.</p><p>Nose Tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</p><h3>Superstar Mode</h3><p>Fumble rate chance has been decreased in Snow Games.</p><p>Fixed an issue where players would play in the wrong position.</p><p>Fixed a rare issue where players’ knees would be invisible during the NFL Combine.</p><p>Several stability fixes.</p><h3>Ultimate Team</h3><p>Play A Friend will now respect each individual users passing settings</p><p>Remedied an issue where opening a Fantasy Pack after a H2H game caused visual artifacts during the pack open</p><p>Fixed an issue where rewards images failed to appear on some screens</p><p>Fixed multiple occasions where players were navigated to the wrong menu</p><p>Fixed a text issue where “Rank Down” appeared instead of “Rank Up”</p><p>Fixed an issue where progress in Ranked was not visually displaying</p><p>Fixed multiple occasions of overlapping text</p><p>Fixed an occasional crash when returning to lobbies</p><p>Items displayed during presentation did not always match their actual rarity</p><h3>Audio</h3><p>Fixed an issue where commentary referred to a few rookies by an incorrect last name.</p>
