            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-saudi-arabia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, reports started surfacing claiming that Microsoft was preparing to wind down sales of Xbox consoles in Saudi Arabia. In a post on social media that kickstarted the discussion, it was written that ‘even distributors won’t be able to get the device.’</p>



<p>This apparent revelation prompted Microsoft to get involved, and the Chief Consumer Sales Officer, Ami Silverman, set everyone straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-plans">No Plans</h2>



<p>In a statement circulated amongst outlets, Xbox’s Ami Silverman said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Xbox devices are available in all current Xbox hardware-supported countries, including Saudi Arabia</em>. C<em>onsole availability may vary by country but Xbox games can be played on consoles, PCs, and on phones, tablets or TVs where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available</em>. <em>Players can visit&nbsp;xbox.com/regions&nbsp;to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Admittedly, it’s a pretty weak statement, but it eliminates the present concern that Xbox is preparing to pull out of Saudi Arabia. It doesn’t talk about the future of the market, but this should be enough to alleviate the concerns of Middle Eastern gamers.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been the smoothest sailing for Xbox over the last few years, but the goal of the company is to reach more gamers around the world, allowing for the Xbox platform to become the most accessible gaming service ever devised. </p>



<p>It was just about one year ago that Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-gaming-growth-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense growth in Asian markets</a>, and in July 2024, it was referenced that Microsoft’s ‘gaming ecosystem’ boasts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 million monthly active users</a> – and that figure is growing exponentially. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsofts-xbox-earnings-report-q2-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox reported record growth</a> amidst layoffs and studio shutdowns. At the same time, Microsoft hit a $3 trillion market valuation.</p>



<p>But I digress.</p>



<p>Xbox won’t stop selling consoles in Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <p>The game introduces a groundbreaking “psychogeographic RPG” mechanic, where every decision reshapes both the world and the characters that inhabit it.

Longdue is committed to making games that carry the weight of thoughtful design and engaging storytelling, positioning the studio as a steady, dependable voice in RPG development.</p><p>Longdue aims to create games that resonate emotionally and intellectually. The studio is here to build a reputation for consistently delivering quality, with a focus on depth and narrative integrity. This is just the beginning of Longdue’s journey to become a trusted name in the greater RPG canon.</p></blockquote><p>Visit the Longdue official website <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">"Longdue’s debut project is developed with key creatives from the original Disco Elysium team and contributors to the unreleased sequel, carrying forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach that defined its predecessor," Longdue said in a press release announcing both the studio's formation and the game itself. "The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters."</p><p dir="ltr">Like Disco Elysium, Longdue's currently unnamed project is an RPG that focuses on psychological depth and player choices, with the game's developers striving to honor Disco Elysium's legacy. It's no coincidence that Longdue chose to announce the game and the formation of the new studio on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium's original release.</p><p dir="ltr">"Announced on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium, Longdue’s first project honors the cRPG canon while establishing itself as a steady and dependable voice in the future of isometric RPG design," Longdue said in the press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Described as "a psychogeographic RPG with narrative depth," Longdue's upcoming title will explore "the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious, the seen and unseen," and challenges places with difficult choices that will "ripple between the character’s psyche and environment," forcing players to find their way through "a constantly shifting landscape shaped by both internal and external forces."</p><p dir="ltr">Longdue says the "psychogeographic RPG mechanic" featured in the game results in every decision having an effect on both the in-game world, and the characters who live within it.</p><p dir="ltr">"In this experience, the lines between the mind and the environment blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, leading players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape."</p><p>Little else is currently known about the upcoming RPG, as its developer has yet to even reveal the game's title, but updates are likely to be posted to <a href="http://www.longduegames.com/" rel="nofollow ">Longdue Games' official website</a> as development progresses.</p>

<p>Nexon’s CEO recently sat down for an interview at the Tokyo Game Show and started talking about his career, the growth of Nexon, and what it takes to build a successful game. Nexon is one of the world’s biggest developers and publishers of games, and most recently, the brand has been in the news because of certain character designs in The First Descendant, an action-MMO game.</p>



<p>Speaking candidly, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, said that user feedback is infinitely more important than numbers and historical data when it comes to assembling a game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-numbers-will-not-produce-good-results">‘Numbers Will Not Produce Good Results’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/649/G064958/20241007024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with 4Gamer</a>, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, suggested that community feedback is one of the most important resources a studio can listen to when piecing together a game.</p>

<p>Now that costs are high, I think that on the contrary, setting a strict budget and moving based on the numbers will not produce good results. If you rely on user feedback, it may make a difference in whether it sells or sells more, but I don’t think it will be the case that the development costs will go to waste if it doesn’t sell at all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yong-Hyun mentioned that ‘making games by calculating backwards form numbers was fine in the past,’ suggesting that the prior success of games and what went well back then isn’t enough to base the development of a new game on.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that focusing on user feedback is the most reliable standard at present … I think that if you confidently tell the upper management, “This game will be well received by users!”, it will be accepted, but I don’t think it will work if you say, “We can make this much money.” This is because the sales figures change depending on various circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nexon recently made some major changes to The First Descendant, an all-new action MMO that was released in July to a mixed reception. In recent days, the brand has piqued the interest of gamers everywhere on social media following the reveal of Ultimate Freyna, a more powerful variant of a base character with one of the most revealing outfits we’ve ever seen in a game.</p>



<p>The community response to this character was monumental, and a fervour set about the market that was indicative of the skin selling well despite not yet having hit the market. Ultimate Freyna was added to The First Descendant on October 10 and has been turning heads since.</p>

<p><em>I am speed</em>.</p>



<p>If the Logitech Pro X Superlight 2 Dex could speak, it would say that every time you grasp it, ever ready for action and willing to deliver. This premium, competitive-grade gaming wireless mouse is impressive in many ways, but the blistering speed it offers esports players is the biggest talking point here.</p>



<p>Read on to scout through my full Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review, hot off the press in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-like-air">Like Air</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is one of those peripherals that looks dramatically simple on the surface but packs a punch under the hood. It weighs just 60 grams, which <strong>feels bizarrely light </strong>if you’re not used to esports mice. </p>



<p>That weight accommodates the enhanced HERO 2 sensor, the technology required to drive both the LIGHTFORCE switches and LIGHTSPEED mechanics and a battery that lasts a whopping 95 hours on a full charge. This is perhaps the lightest gaming mouse in the world right now, but it still manages to feel sturdy in your hand.</p>



<p>On a clean desk mat, the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex moves like a skate across flat ice. It’s as ergonomic as you could ever hope for a mouse to be, and when you’re gripping it, nothing is slowing you down from soaring across a gaming surface unhindered by <strong>anything</strong>. That’s thanks to the zero-additive PTFE feet, which offer best-in-class motion.</p>



<p>This is a competitive gaming mouse that has been designed hand-in-hand with the world’s best pro players, and that means something these days.</p>



<h2 id="h-talking-numbers">Talking Numbers</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex features Logitech’s proprietary Lightspeed technology, offering users an 8 kHz polling rate. When paired with the Lightforce switches, which feel immensely satisfying and responsive, users are moving fast and never missing a click.</p>



<p>It’s customisable through G Hub, even if there isn’t any way to customise the <strong>look </strong>of the mouse — by that, I mean there’s no onboard RGB. That’s not the point of this mouse, as it’s prioritising function over form.</p>



<p>The mouse has five buttons, a resolution that climbs as high as 44,0000 dpi, and a maximum speed of approximately 888 ips. </p>



<p>In the box, I was pleased to find optional grip tape designed to make the mouse more tactile at the cost of a couple of extra grams. It’s a soft-touch, easy-to-apply arrangement that’ll make the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex feel a touch more sizeable and easier to grip, especially if you’re the kind of gamer who gets sweaty palms.</p>



<p>Make no mistake – this is one of the most advanced wireless gaming mice you’ll ever see. I’ve been using one for a few weeks to work and play with, and I haven’t been able to identify a single flaw. And I’ve tried, but I’ll be wrapping this Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review without listing a negative.</p>



<p>At around $150, the mouse sits at the higher end of the cost spectrum, but it’s honestly worth every penny. I was perpetually tied to the G502 Hero as my daily driver for the longest time, but the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex and its versatility and accuracy may have just won me over.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-%E2%80%93-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots.1006938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio features an interesting class system called the Archetype System that allows each character to play a role in battle. Whether it's physical damage, magical damage, healing, tanking, or support, each Archetype lineage has a specific focus, but you are given the chance to branch out a bit thanks to one mechanic that makes the entire system quite versatile: the Skill Inheritance system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008131013_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you unlock any archetype in Metaphor: ReFantazio after reaching a certain point in the story, you will be given the chance to inherit skills you have learned using other Archetypes. All you need to do is access the dedicated menu at the Akademia or in the main menu after strengthening your bond with More, pick the skill you want to inherit, and spend Maga to make the skill inheritable. Doing so once will make the skill permanently available for inheritance, no matter the currently equipped archetype.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008130943_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, however, your customization options will be very limited, as Archetypes can only inherit a single skill. However, there's a way to increase the skill inheritance slots. By strengthening the bonds with your followers, you will learn the Scion's Skill, Scion's Merit, and Scion's Essence abilities, which will increase slots to 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The latter is generally learned at Rank 8 with only a few exceptions, like with Gallica, so the maximum number of customization possibilities will only be granted towards the end of the game. Still, by balancing your party composition and Archetypes, you should have no trouble being prepared for every danger you will encounter as you attempt to take down Louis and dispel the curse gripping the Prince.</p>

Australians have been asking for this for years — and Valve promised to make it happen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit">way back in November 2021</a>.</p><p>It’ll arrive <em>this</em> November in the same primary configurations Valve sells elsewhere: a 256GB configuration of the original LCD model, or 512GB and 1TB versions of the newer OLED model that also come with longer battery life, a better screen, and more. They’ll cost AUD $649, $899, and $1,049 respectively. </p><p>(While the OLED model does cost $250 AUD more than the original, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">it has so many important changes</a> that I’d personally recommend it over the LCD version to anyone who can afford it.)</p><p>While even the OLED model will be an entire year old by the time it arrives in Australia, there’s no current indication that Valve will release a faster, better version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">anytime soon</a> — and no handheld running Windows can currently match it for portable ease-of-use, even though some have an edge in performance and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> can also beat it in AAA gaming battery life.</p><p>That said, Valve may also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">bring its SteamOS to rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally X before too many more months go by, and I’ve been very impressed when running Bazzite’s version of the SteamOS interface on my Ally X review unit (though it has its wrinkles).</p><p>If you’re at PAX Australia in Melbourne, you can try the Steam Deck at Valve’s booth today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a post on <a href="https://x.com/MAlbsimi/status/1844310455432642698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a>, he said that Microsoft had already made retailers aware that it would soon stop selling Xbox devices in Saudi Arabia.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-sports-game-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was <em>yesterday </em>that I was writing</a> about the stasis that major sports games find themselves in, with annual updates so minimal it's getting increasingly tough to see what's changed year to year. One sports game--<em>Football Manager</em>--had been looking to buck that trend in 2024, but sadly it has now suffered two major mishaps in quick succession.</p><p>The first came on September 4,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when developers Sports Interactive announced</a> that the game's international management mode--where players can not just manage a club side, but a national team as well--was being canned so that they could get the main game out on time.</p><p>Now, today,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> they've said that <em>Football Manager 25</em> itself, which should have been out very soon, won't be out until March 2025</a>. That's not a huge delay for a normal video game, but for a sports game, where so much of the appeal is based on featuring the latest rosters and teams, it's a <em>colossal</em> blow.</p><p>The reason for both moves is pretty major: for the first time in a long time, <em>Football Manager 25</em> was rebuilding itself from the ground up. New engine, new menus, new layout, the works. It was a bold decision to make, but also a necessary one; like the sports games<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about yesterday</a>, <em>Football Manager</em> was starting to feel a bit stale, its sluggish menus and dated presentation making it look increasingly tired.</p><p>This delay will be a <em>huge </em>deal for the game and for its sales, because March is nearing the end of the European football season, which normally wraps up in May. Traditionally, like other football games, <em>Football Manager</em> would release towards the end of the calendar year, which was early enough to still play out most of the current season (which starts in Aug-Sep), while also allowing the game to be on shelves (physical or otherwise) in time for the holidays.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think this is <em>great</em>. Unlike other major sports games, Sports Interactive recognised their game's advancing age, made a bold decision to get with the times and stuck to it. It hasn't entirely panned out, sure, but a move like this isn't made for just one year, it's made for years and even decades to come, and so even if <em>Football Manager 25</em> doesn't really come together--and let's be real, given this delay there's a chance it may not come out at all--everyone involved in this decision still deserves an enormous amount of respect.</p><p>Especially when you consider how frank the team are in the announcement post, writing:</p><blockquote><div><p>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done.&nbsp;</p><p>Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November.</p><p>Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Whatever happens to <em>Football Manager 25</em>, I'm a lot more optimistic about <em>Football Manager 26</em> and <em>27</em> than I am about any other big sports game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">US court ruling earlier this week</a> that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st, Microsoft is ready to take advantage of the changes.</p><p>“The court’s ruling to open up Google’s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility,” says Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255">in a post on X</a>. “Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.”</p><p>Google’s Android app store is an illegal monopoly, and the search giant has been ordered to open up the Play Store to competition for three years. This means no longer forcing developers to use its own Google Play Billing after a jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store. Google will also have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em>&nbsp;</em>within<em>&nbsp;</em>Google Play.</p><p>Xbox store purchase support directly in the mobile Android app will allow Microsoft to sell Xbox games freely on Android devices, and integrated Xbox Cloud Gaming features mean people will be able to immediately stream games to their handsets after purchasing them. </p><p>It’s not immediately clear why Microsoft can’t already provide Xbox game purchases inside its Android mobile app, though. You can buy games from Steam or the PlayStation Store on mobile devices, so Microsoft has long been the exception here. I asked Microsoft for more details on the store changes, but the company says Bond’s statement is all it has to share right now.</p><p>Separately, Microsoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">originally planning to launch in July</a>. The store will eventually focus on first-party mobile games from Microsoft’s various studios, but initially it will feature deals and in-game items. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">Microsoft said in August</a> that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and “work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 11th</strong>: Article updated to note Microsoft isn’t sharing any more details on its Xbox mobile changes on Android.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was officially announced in December 2021, with Ubisoft announcing that they were doing a remake of the 2002 title Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. They announced that they were developing the game using the Snowdrop engine. This engine was also used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws, both of which didn't perform particularly well for Ubisoft. After rumors swirling around for a significant period of time suggesting that the Splinter Cell Remake had been canceled, new rumors have reported that the Splinter Cell Remake is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">continuing to progress</a> over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto is the one leading the remake development, and it announced the game with an interview on the Ubisoft website, alongside a video. However, that was over two years ago and there has been nothing posted by the company since the initial announcement.&nbsp; As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's rumored that the game is still being developed under the codename North. As stated previously, they are using the Snowdrop Engine to develop the game, whereas the previous Splinter Cell games in the franchise were developed using Unreal Engine 2 and Unreal Engine 2.5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When the game was first announced, it was said that the game was in the "very earliest stages of development." Compared to most games coming out these days that are remastering old games, Ubisoft has gone the route that Square Enix took with Final Fantasy 7 and has decided to do a full-on remake. As they have stated, they are building the game from the ground up, including creating new visuals, which means that the game is going to take an extensive period of time. Looking back to the example of Final Fantasy 7's remake, there are significant gaps between each release. The remake was first released in 2020, with Rebirth being released in 2024.</p>
<p>Because of how drastic the changes are and how they have stated that they are taking their time to make sure the visuals are linear to the original, it's possible that those excited for a high-fidelity remake of teenage nostalgia will take a bit longer. Some sources suggest that the Splinter Cell Remake will be released sometime in 2026, but there's no guarantee that there will be any news by that point, depending on what other projects Ubisoft is focusing on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In addition to the general development process, it's possible that the team developing the Splinter Cell Remake will be impacted by Ubisoft's financial insecurity right now, as well as the possibility of the company going private and receiving a change in CEO as well as potential layoffs. At the moment, it's anyone's guess as to what is happening with the Splinter Cell Remake, but we have to trust that the statement is correct and that the game is still in active development.</p>

			<p>Anime fans of all ages, let it be known that another Dragon Ball game is upon us, and it’s a damn good one! That means it’s once again time to learn all about how Goku became the worst father of all-time. Wait, no. It’s time to find out how Gohan stopped being a whiny baby, became a badass teenager, and then became a whiny adult again. Wait no. It’s time to d-d-d-duel?</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dfbu3CJS0uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is an interestingly placed Dragon Ball game. The last few games based off this long-running anime series have been an intensely competitive fighting game in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and a time-travelling constant What-If? scenario complete with co-op and custom characters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/02/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review/">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a>. Those two games were inherently aimed at very different audiences in terms of raw gameplay, but ultimately, as a huge Dragon Ball fan, I’ve played a lot of both – as have a lot of people, I’d imagine. Also, there was a card game and a lot of mobile gacha games as well, but we’re not here for those.</p>


<p>Sparking! Zero sits more on the Xenoverse end of things than the FighterZ end, but really, it’s about throwing us back to the PlayStation 2-era Budokai Tenkaichi games. That means you get to transform in battle, you get to clash your beams against each other, and you get just so very many characters to mess around with. Sure, there are a lot of people who look like Goku here (or actually just are Goku), but to be fair to the game, that’s true to the source material.</p>


<p>The story is largely stuff we’ve all seen before, although the alternate takes on things are fun, especially as you get to make the conversational decisions yourself, and you’ll get to see a lot of What-If? stuff throughout the game, which is great. The key thing here though, is the combat. You’ll be mixing in melee strikes, ki blasts at range, and special skills as well. It’s standard Dragon Ball fighting stuff, but it’s the more granular things that help this feel like you’re playing an episode of the anime.</p>
<p>As long as you manage your resources well, you can teleport behind enemies as you get hit or deflect incoming energy blasts with a well-timed block. You can also switch in and out of different characters and even transform between different forms. Different characters have their own unique quirks to learn as well, so you’ll need to practice to be truly great, but if you master the basics, you’ll be able to make most characters look good in battle.</p>

<p>It’s all a lot of fun, but it does take time to get to that level, because the learning curve here can feel pretty steep, especially if you’re not familiar with the previous games in the vast Dragon Ball lineage. It’s worth pushing through though, because the result is one of the most joyful interpretations of Dragon Ball we’ve had in a long while, and while I don’t think it’s reinventing anything, it looks good, sounds good, and feels good to play.</p>

		As a modern successor and sequel to the classic PS2 era Budokai Tenkaichi trilogy, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a great time for Dragon Ball fans.

<p>The 2025 VCT season is right around the corner, and teams are beginning to assemble their rosters. With Valorant competitive already at an all-time high, many organizations are looking to sign the best players in the world. Popular esports organization, NRG, announces its official 2025 VCT roster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-official-nrg-2025-vct-roster-revealed">Official NRG 2025 VCT Roster Revealed</h2>



<p>It is a big day for Valorant fans, as NRG has officially announced its 2025 VCT roster, with some of the best names in Valorant revealed to be on it. </p>



<p>Five players; one team; NRG is looking to be one of the top competitors next season. Here is the team’s entire 2025 roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>s0m</li>



<li>FNS</li>



<li>Verno</li>



<li>Ethan</li>



<li>Mada</li>
</ul>



<p>With NRG not making it to the 2024 VCT Champions, the team seems to be preparing for a much more successful season in 2025. </p>



<p>Jumping from $40,000 in earnings in 2022 to almost $200,000 in 2023, the team saw barely any competition in 2024. 2025, however, looks to be a much better year for the popular esports organization.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-valorant-spotlight-series-emea-2024-schedule-and-format">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-spotlight-series-emea-2024-schedule-and-format/">Valorant Spotlight Series EMEA 2024 Schedule and Format</a></h6>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nrg-new-roster-has-some-of-the-best-valorant-players-in-the-league">NRG New Roster Has Some of the Best Valorant Players in the League</h2>



<p>NRG did not hold back when putting together its new Valorant roster. In fact, Ethan had competed back in 2023 for Evil Geniuses when they won the Valorant Champions. </p>



<p>Two of the team’s newest signings, Mada and Verno, were both signed today (October 10, 2024). While the two players have been competing within the league for a while now, neither have competed on the main stage for Valorant Champions.</p>



<p>It seems, though, like these two new prospects could be incredibly beneficial for the team. It will be interesting to see how the team performs together during next season and whether or not the chemistry will be there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-jump-in-and-play-new-world-aeternum/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are a fan of MMORPG, you probably have your sights set on the numerous upcoming releases. Not long ago, fans were treated to Throne and Liberty, which was pretty entertaining. But now, we have New World Aeternum around the corner, and it’s shaping up to be the total overhaul that fans want. So, when can you play New World Aeternum?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-new-world-aeternum-release">When Does New World Aeternum Release?</h2>



<p>New World Aeternum completely overhauls much of the core experience from the original MMORPG by Amazon Games. It’s a relaunch that essentially introduces an archetype class system, streamlined mechanics, and a more effortless new player experience for fans to dive straight into the supernatural universe the studio crafted. Most importantly, you can play it yourself on October 15 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>More specifically, you can log in and start a character at 12 AM Pacific / 7 AM UTC in Europe and Southeastern Asia-Pacific regions or 4 AM Pacific / 11 AM UTC in North and South America.</p>



<p>Furthermore, depending on your region, you can preload the game on October 13 at 12 AM US Pacific (SIEE) or 6 AM US Pacific (SIEA).</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-new-world-and-new-world-aeternum">What’s the Difference Between New World and New World Aeternum?</h2>



<p>For the most part, New World Aeternum is New World. It’s a soft relaunch of the MMORPG, retaining its core elements—namely, the action combat system and crafting/gathering mechanics that initially made so many fall in love with the game.</p>



<p>That said, Aeternum does vary somewhat. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>10-player raid</li>



<li>Soul Trials</li>



<li>Swimming</li>



<li>Engine optimization</li>



<li>Server shards</li>



<li>Improved storytelling and cinematics</li>



<li>PvP-specific zone</li>



<li>Gear score increase up to 725</li>



<li>Cross-platform play between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li>Fresh start worlds for new players</li>

<p>The motion detectors reportedly work with various bed sizes, from twin to king. As users shift position, the clock's display responds by moving on-screen characters from left to right and playing sound effects from Nintendo video games based on different selectable themes.</p>

<p>The Verge's Chris Welch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">examined</a> the new device at Nintendo's New York City store shortly after its announcement, noting that setting up Alarmo involves a lengthy process of configuring its motion-detection features. The setup cannot be skipped and might prove challenging for younger users. The clock prompts users to input the date, time, and bed-related information to calibrate its sensors properly. Even so, Welch described "small, thoughtful Nintendo touches throughout the experience."</p>
<h2>Themes and sounds</h2>
<p>Beyond motion tracking, the clock has a few other tricks up its sleeve. Its screen brightness adjusts automatically based on ambient light levels, and users can control Alarmo through buttons on top, including a large dial for navigation and selection.</p>
<p>The device's full-color rectangular display shows the time and 35 different scenes that feature animated Nintendo characters from games like the aforementioned <em>Super Mario Odyssey, </em><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>, as well as <em>Pikmin 4 </em>and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>Alarmo also offers sleep sounds to help users doze off. Nintendo plans to release additional downloadable sounds and themes for the device in the future using its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, which are accessible after linking a Nintendo account. The Nintendo website mentions upcoming themes for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in particular.</p>
<p>As of today, Nintendo Online members can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/">order an Alarmo online</a>, and as mentioned above, Nintendo says the clock will be available through other retailers in January 2025.</p>

			<p>The God of War Greek Saga is rumored to be in the works after a <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1844400692120912202?t=h5qjwTNAaBqgLTBtJvZbZg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user on X</a> says that says that all of the games that were created in the Greek Saga will be developed and remastered by Santa Monica Studios in collaboration with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nixxes-is-working-more-and-more-on-remasters-claims-dev/">Nixxes Software</a>. However, it's advised to take this statement with a huge pinch of salt, as there are no cited sources, and there haven't been any rumblings about these games being remastered previously. Of course, it is entirely possible that they are correct, but without posting any sort of source, it's hard to know for sure.</p>
<p>According to the post on X, it's alleged that the development of all of the games in the God of War Greek Saga is already finished, and they are just waiting to announce the remaster's release date. It's reported that these remastered titles (if they exist) will be released in 2025, with an announcement about the games coming from any time in December through to March.&nbsp; When most people think of the Greek Saga of God of War, most people think of God of War I through to III, but it's reported that the remastered Greek Saga will include all of the PSP games as well as God of War: Ascension.</p>
<p>One of the only God of War games that wasn't mentioned to be remastered was God of War: Betrayal. The comments on the post are mixed, with some saying that it would be a day one purchase for them, with others being disappointed that it's potentially a remaster and not a remake of the games instead.</p>
<p>Santa Monica Studios is known for making the God of War franchise, with them helping externally in other games such as Journey and Twisted Metal. They also helped to develop God of War III Remastered, which provides more context as to why they may be working on developing a remaster or remake of the God of War Greek Saga.</p>
<p>As stated before, this is just a rumor from someone who has had trustworthy leaks before, but it could be a complete falsehood. There are no sources to verify this claim, and there have been no other reports of the games being in development by Santa Monica Studios or Nixxes Software.</p>

For weeks, ever since Nintendo skipped its traditional September showcase, there has been background chatter suggesting that official news would finally be coming about the Switch 2 any day now. Instead, the company rolled out Alarmo without batting an eye. Pre-orders went live and have already sold out. Naturally, some people are trying to sell Alarmo, which doesn’t ship until 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for close to double its standard price on eBay</a></span>.</p><p>But the funniest part about Alarmo is that it doesn’t work well for couples. The sensor that shuts the clock off when you get out of bed has trouble distinguishing when there are two people sleeping together. “Alarmo can’t detect a specific person, so if multiple people are sleeping in the same bed within range of the sensor, the alarm may stop when one person gets out of bed, but restart once it detects there is still someone in bed,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/~/nintendo-sound-clock%3A-alarmo-faq#s1q6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/~/nintendo-sound-clock%3A-alarmo-faq#s1q6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads the FAQ</a></span>. “The alarm will stop completely once everyone is out of bed.”</p><p>Sounds like fun.

That means a lot of the characters and lore from the mobile title carry over to <em>Relink </em>to continue their stories. That connection needn’t be a deal-breaker for those who have no experience with the mobile game, however, as in all honesty <em>Relink</em>’s story is hardly its best quality. There are some compelling tales you can uncover in side quests, but<em> Relink</em>’s best aspects are its fantastic combat and the environments you’ll explore.</p><p>Most of <em>Relink </em>consists of missions in which your hero and three other adventurers battle their way through hordes of enemies until you reach a boss. Like in its predecessor, you have a lot of potential party members to choose from, and team composition is both the most important part of the game, and also the most fun. That’s because you can mix and match to your heart’s content, finding the perfect play style and party that works best for you. Combat is real-time and can play out quite differently depending on your characters’ attributes. There are magic wielders, good old-fashioned guys with swords, and more, and combat requires you to use their assortment of abilities to chain together attacks while also timing blocks and dodges to avoid damage. Battles can get pretty exciting as you use everything in your arsenal and have to really think about what you’re doing. Your party members will act on their own, but you’ll be shocked by how well they’ll support you, which is one of <em>Relink</em>’s greatest accomplishments. </p><p>To add a cherry on top, long-time <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825">Nobuo Uemetsu</a></span> did a lot of music for the original gacha game and those tracks constantly appear in <em>Relink</em>. If you’re a longtime fan of his work at Square Enix, you’ll immediately recognize the distinctive flair of his tracks when you hear them in <em>Relink</em>, and they really help make the game feel like the charming RPG it is.
