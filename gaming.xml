            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/hunt-showdown-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-versions-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crytek">Crytek</a> has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> will finally make its debut on current gen home consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. This comes as part of a major update for the popular extraction shooter that will see a technical overhaul as well as a “mountain” of new content rolled out during the summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer Update | Date Reveal | Hunt: Showdown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will include a brand new Hunt: Showdown map, an updated user experience, and an upgrade to CRYENGINE 5.11. Besides giving PC players a nice little boost, this will also beef up the visuals and performance for the newly-announced PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions albeit with a slight caveat. When the upgrade lands on August 15th, 2024, Crytek will effectively end support for Hunt: Showdown on PS4 and Xbox One. Those who play on these systems will be entitled to a free upgrade with their progress and DLC carrying over.</p>
<p>These changes mark a new era for Hunt: Showdown and one that will hopefully attract a new wave of fans as well as lapsed veterans. Shutting down those last gen versions is bound to impact a minority yet, as someone who plays on PS4, I’ve often felt as though Sony’s old hardware has been holding me back, especially when matched with PC gamers via online cross-play.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown is easily one of the best extraction shooters out there, mainly thanks to being one of the genre’s first pioneers. After entering early access in 2018, it quickly garnered a loyal fanbase who fell in love with its dark atmosphere and tense PvP, competing with other bounty hunters to track and kill a dark menagerie of monsters before making off with their loot.</p>


<p>Back when the game launched on PS4 and Xbox One, we scored it an 8/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/11/hunt-showdown-review-console-ps4-xbox/">Hunt: Showdown review</a> saying:</p>
<p>“I’ll admit I wasn’t keen on Hunt: Showdown to start with, but after the first few matches I realised there’s something special here. This is an unusual entry in a genre ruled by far snappier shooters, and it takes time to get your head around Crytek’s clever twist on the formula. Stick with it and you’ll be rewarded with a uniquely engrossing multiplayer experience.”</p>
<p>What else is Crytek currently working on? After recently remastering its trilogy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis">Crysis</a> games, the studio has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis-4">Crysis 4</a> is officially in the works. We’ll hopefully hear more about that project soon.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's free-to-play arena shooter XDefiant's first patch has been released.</p>
<p>Entitled <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/4IhHSi1KgvXFeiFHIEZMga">"Preseason Patch 1"</a>, it addresses a number of specific issues, including one with loading into the Practice Zone – some players found themselves "in a hellscape" outside the world – and another that sees devices dropped at players' feet should they die during device deployment. Up until now, they would still be thrown as if you hadn't just carked it.</p>
<p>This means Practice Zone has been turned back on, although the team warns "it's possible weird things could still happen". So make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Also, that issue "where you'd get hitmarkers on an enemy as they killed you, but their health bar still appeared full to you?" Turns out the health bar display was wrong and you did indeed damage them. That "should be fixed now", along with one bug that displayed end-of-match text with the wrong orientation in Arabic and another that was causing low framerates for some AMD GPU users.</p><p>
ot
</p><p>This should be great news for the millions of players who jumped onto XDefiant as soon as it launched. According to Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, the shooter hit one million unique players within just two and a half hours of going live, which is quite a feat given the now seemingly prerequisite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-like-shooter-xdefiant-faces-the-typical-matchmaking-woes-on-launch">release day matchmaking issues</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, cheaters have already found their way into XDefiants ranks, and right now there's not much players can do about it. XDefiant uses BattleEye, the same anti-cheat system engaged in Rainbow Six Siege and… well, anyone who's spent any time at all with Siege will know that cheaters are rife.</p>
<p>"Seen a post on Twitter about the Anti-Cheat. Only knew it was a matter of time before the cheating community managed to find a bypass," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cyj42j/comment/l5azkrh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy player. "Things will only get worse from here, and it’s only pre-season. Net code and Anti-cheat should’ve been the things to prioritise from the start. Gameplay and everything else could’ve been handled over time."</p>
<p>"I'd say I'm encountering one cheater every 2-3 games, which is kinda annoying af," added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cyj42j/comment/l5aozu3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another</a>. "Best way to get rid of them is to make them play exclusively against each other. That'd be fun."</p>

</span></p><p>Ubisoft's Tom Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter XDefiant finally launched for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 21st May, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">delays</a>.

            <p>We've known for some time that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-is-headed-to-fortnites-next-season">Fallout was coming</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, we just weren't entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season's wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> affair. There's a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fortnite's new season (Chapter 5, Season 3) is out right this second and the map's been hit with a big old sandstorm that's birthed a new Wasteland biome. It's home to red earth and a gang of unruly folks called the "Wasteland Warriors", who drive juiced up scrap on wheels. Their base of operations is a ship they've the front out of, making it look like a shark's head. It's actually pretty cool, to be fair.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the new map layout, via a Xweet:</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>For me, highlights include rocket-propelled metal gloves called the Nitro Fists, that let you charge powerful uppercuts or perform aerial punches that dash you through the air. And as a personal fan of driving about, this season seems entirely aimed at folks like me. There's a bunch of new car mods, letting you attach machine guns or grenade launchers or spiked bumpers to your ride. This is good, because I find battle royales are at their finest when you've got groups of people accidentally bumping into each other in metal boxes and then panic-fighting.</p>
<p>There's also a couple of metal boxes to be wary of, and that's in the form of War Buses. They're like the Battle Bus but Mad Max-ified, with two cannons on top and a horn that produces an EMP pulse capable of disabling vehicles or hurting enemy shields. You'll find AI baddies driving two of these things around the map, and acting as a sort of hotspot for control. Fend everyone off, including the AI baddies, and your squad gets a honkin' great war wagon - lovely. </p>
<p>I also like the fact Epic have thought how to best a bunch of vehicles if you're vehicleless. The new Boom Bolt crossbow shoots explosive bolts that'll total cars and War Buses in only a few hits if you're accurate enough.</p>
<p>If you're after all the tweaks and changes, you can find them over on Epic's <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/crash-the-party-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked?lang=en-US">patch notes page</a>.</p>

			<p>Polish developer 11 bit studios is mostly known to gamers for This War of Mine and Frostpunk, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a>, they are doing something very different. It's a sci-fi survival game where you play as miner Jan Dolski, who is stranded on an alien planet and must find a way to repair his mobile base and get the hell out of the planet before the local sun's lethal radiation kills him.</p>
<p>This is not a one-person job, to say the least. Thankfully, Jan has technology at his disposal that allows him to create the titular Alters, alternate copies of himself who made different decisions at key points in Jan's life. It's an intriguing premise, and we dig into it throughout the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview that just went live.</a></p>
<p>We also got the chance to interview Lead Designer Rafał Włosek to learn more about the making of The Alters and its feature set. Keep scrolling after the embedded video to read the full transcript</p>
<p>The game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X sometime this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>I think the first question, just from playing it, is, what was the inspiration behind creating The Alters? It's quite unique, at least in the actual thematic nature of just creating multiple versions of yourself to get yourself out of that jam.</strong></p>
<p>Well, the process is always very complicated, not only creating the prototype but also trying to figure out what game we're going to make. At 11 bit, it always starts more from the idea of the topic we would like to talk about. Not from the idea of the gameplay. It was the same this time as well.</p>
<p>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</p>
<p>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</p>
<p>It's very hard to say that it was like a single idea. It was more like an iterative process to get there.</p>
<p><strong>I noticed you use many links to cloning in real life. The first thing you create is Molly, a reference to the first cloned sheep. I'm guessing you've got a few amusing Easter eggs in the game.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we do. Definitely, it's not by accident that we put the sheep there. But I guess this is more like, you know, a bit of humor. Actually, we want to put a lot of small humorous things here and there because our previous games were very heavy, let's say. I was also a lead designer of This War of Mine and we didn't want to repeat that. So, this is where it comes from. However, this is not a game about cloning.</p>
<p><strong>Indeed. I've created the technician in the demo, and it links into This War of Mine in the sense of the emotions, like immediately, every single conversation piece you're doing has a big effect on their mood. So, yeah, the technician really doesn't like me so far.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, there is this obvious situation where you create a new person just to move forward and he's very disoriented and probably feels used by you. But there's also this other layer of it, more symbolic, where you are trying to actually cope with your own self, your own different version when you are trying to figure out which decision was good. Do I like this decision or&nbsp;not?</p>
<p>Which version of myself would I like the most? But of course, we don't want to answer this question. We just ask them.</p>
<p><strong>You want the player to explore those questions themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It would be very unfortunate if we tried to give an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously, you create the technician because that's what the story demands at that point. As you go forward, do you get to make more choices in which path you create? Is it linear progression, or do you get that flexibility to create what you want?</strong></p>
<p>We definitely wanted to create something that we could work on in much detail because the story in this game is the most important part, and in order to do it real good, we preferred to create some solid branching points in which we can have much more control. All of them have their different stories. They are very well connected to each other, not to mention very well connected with different problems that the player has. So yeah, this is more prepared.</p>
<p><strong>With survival games, by the nature of gameplay, you tend to get a lot of replay value from that. As you said, there's key branching points in The Alters. Are you going to have different ways of the characters reacting to what you say to them? Will there also be replay elements, like where you travel to? Is it directed as to where you go Essentially, how long can you survive?</strong></p>
<p>This is kind of a tricky question because there's many layers the game operates on. It's not just a survival game where you have a huge amount of replayability, but it's also not closed like a story-driven game. In order to answer your question well, I would have to put some background in it.</p>
<p>We created the game in the form of layers. The top layer would be the main storyline. It's the story of Jan, who is trying to survive on this planet. He's also looking into his past life and trying to deal with his own past decisions, problems, and insecurities.</p>
<p>Then there is another layer of all the Alters and as the first layer is always more or less, well, one story. It has a lot of endings, but it's one story. Then you have the Alters and you cannot have them all in one playthrough. Each Alter has his own story and shows you different parts, different Jan versions. So, you can't know Jan entirely playing the game just once. Finally, we have a third part, which includes mechanics that come from the emotions of the Alters, the interaction between each other, the interaction between you and them, and the way you treat them.</p>
<p>You can push them in many different directions. Maybe you can try to use them more or try to be the best for them, but then you cannot fulfill the mission as well. Depending on your choices, the gameplay will differ, of course.</p>
<p><strong>So it will branch quite a little bit in that. As an example, could you alienate one of your relatives, really piss them off so they don't want to help you at all, and you've got to find other ways of doing things?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for example. In general, this comes with many different gameplay flairs. Of course, there's the strategy version then because it's also a strategic and survival game, depending on what technology you achieve and research and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, to round it all up, I think you could have a couple of playthroughs that lead you to different stories, allow you to explore different aspects of Jan, and maybe have different endings because they might differ a lot. But it's not as replayable as the typical open-world survival game.</p>
<p><strong>Which is good because you can't really have a good directed narrative in that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Alters-Preview-03-Image-01.png"></a></figure>

<p><strong>As you mentioned, you chose the sci-fi setting because it allows you to use the sci-fi technology for that. One of the first things I just noticed is that the setting is you've crash-landed on this planet in a three-star system. I couldn't help but think whether any particular media inspired you in creating this.</strong></p>
<p>No. Well, you're talking about planets, right?</p>
<p><strong>The setting that popped into my head is probably just because I've recently seen the new Netflix TV series The Three Body Problem.</strong></p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p><strong>Because you've got three stars, and you've got the sun just going to come and burn.</strong></p>
<p>As always, there's a couple of layers. First of all, there's art, and I'm not much in this art process because I'm a designer.&nbsp;So, I didn't want to mess up anything that&nbsp;they were up to.</p>
<p>But I know that the general idea for the look for the planet was to create a desolate and empty but beautiful alien world that creates a special environment for Jan to think about his life. He's outside of the normal world. That would be probably the most important part. I don't think it came from some specific book or film. As to the three-body system, I was the one who designed the star system, and I'm very much a space and astronomy amateur. I have my telescope watching the stars and so on, and I was just trying to figure out the best possible star system that would allow the strange situation in which you have to run away from one side. Only much later I watched the series and saw the book.</p>
<p><strong>From what I've played so far, it's genuinely a very great looking game. With the Rapidium crystals, I genuinely asked somebody, is this effect a bug? But no, it's not a bug. At first I wondered if it was gravity from the stars, but it's not that either.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I know that our art director wanted this Rapidium thing to look very much like it's some kind of a glitch, something outside of our universe, let's say of our reality, so unreal it doesn't actually fit exactly. But at the same time, it fits very well.</p>
<p>Oh, they've done a great job because, like I said, the first time I saw it, I was like, is that a bug? Anyway, The Alters looks genuinely great. It does seem like, as with your previous games, emotion is a key part of this. As well as Jannis looking inward, trying to figure out everything that's happened to him in his past and creating the Alters, it is about the what if and how he deals with that.</p>
<p>Yes. So, every Alter comes from a different decision in your life. The origin of the difference is very obvious, so you always have some kind of reference. This one specific thing that made me this person or that. Of course, in real life, it's not that easy. But, on the other hand, there's a lot of situations when we are trying to figure out what would have happened if I changed this one single decision that made me a different man, different friends, different goals in life and values, and so on. This is what happens in Jan's head.</p>
<p><strong>The only other question is how many Alters are there?</strong></p>
<p>This must be the question that didn't get the answer. *laughs* We are trying to set the number so that there is not too much chaos and that the story would be complete and all the answers would be given. I guess it's well-balanced, I would say.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything that you'd like to say about The Alters that I haven't asked?</strong></p>
<p>I like one particular thing about this game, but it's not easily spotted right away when playing it. I'm really proud of how our team managed to combine the story, the narrating stories of all the Alters, with the game mechanics and survival mechanics. They all fit together and were built from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163561/furiosa-mad-max-original-1979-george-miller-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Ya2i6B">The Mad Max series has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity">always thrived on reinvention</a>. No two consecutive movies in the franchise have ever been the same, and most of them aren’t even remotely similar to each other, save for the themes of the Wasteland and the idea of a lone wanderer doing their best to survive. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, the newest movie in the series, may be the biggest exception to that rule: While the movie is explicitly a prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Fury Road</em></a>, it draws its biggest inspirations from the original 1979 <em>Mad Max</em>, giving Max and Furiosa similarly tragic origin stories. </p>
<p id="wWcE09">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Furiosa</em>.]</p>
<p id="w5IoFi">Five movies into the series, with each <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">bigger, louder</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders">more bombastic than the last</a>, it’s easy to forget that George Miller started Max Rockatansky’s story with a simple movie about roving gangs and a man facing a personal tragedy. </p>
<p id="gcQ2m9">The original <em>Mad Max</em> starts before Australia fully descends into the Wasteland chaos the series would later be known for. While Max’s homestead, where he lives with his wife and child, isn’t as idyllic as Furiosa’s Green Place, it seems as beautiful and peaceful a place as anyone could ask for. At least, until a marauding band of highway raiders comes along. Once they arrive, they quickly kill Max’s family, setting him on a path of eternal vengeance and turning him into the Road Warrior we know him as in the rest of the films. </p>

<p id="g0wKrQ">In this way, it feels like <em>Furiosa</em> is almost a remake of the original movie, done up with the budget and beautiful fury Miller has spent the last 45 years perfecting. Furiosa similarly had her peaceful life stolen from her, and her closest family murdered by a gang of marauders, but Miller has adjusted the story this time. Instead of taking most of the movie to show us the bad guys and set up the deterioration of the world, Miller leans on the history of the series, letting <em>Fury Road</em>’s strong world-building in particular fill in the blanks for us. </p>
<p id="hoduE1">We already know the important players and landmarks here: Furiosa herself, Immortan Joe, the Citadel, Gastown, and the Bullet Farm, all introduced in <em>Fury Road</em>. That gives Miller more time to expand on <em>Mad Max</em>’s most effective element: Max’s unbridled rage after his family is attacked. Miller makes Furiosa’s version of this anger the centerpiece of her movie, and turns it into an epic quest that spans more than a decade. He even gives us a similar (though infinitely more twisted) version of Max’s slow, indirect final kill in the movie, with Furiosa letting Dementus die an agonizing death inside a tree. </p>

<p id="cQWs42">All of these little echoes serve as excellent fodder for fans who might want to draw connections between entries in the series. But they’re even more important for deepening the relationship Max and Furiosa share in <em>Fury Road</em>. That movie does a tremendous job of setting up the unspoken bond the two share, like a quiet recognition that they both live with the weight of tremendous loss in their pasts. But it isn’t until we get to see those connections made explicit in <em>Furiosa </em>that we understand just how similar their tragedies actually are. </p>
<p id="K9fbrM"><em>Furiosa</em> is the rare prequel that does more than just tell us a character’s origin story: It deepens our understanding of the entire world she occupies. By connecting Max and Furiosa’s origins, Miller brings the entire Mad Max franchise full circle. Knowing Max and Furiosa are truly kindred spirits, created and driven by the same tragedy and rage, recontextualizes <em>Fury Road</em>’s ending, giving us renewed hope for Max. He’s never seemed like someone who could one day move forward into a better future, rather than just wandering the Wasteland forever — but seeing Furiosa find peace suggests he might be able to as well. But we couldn’t get to that point without Miller bridging <em>Furiosa </em>back to the franchise’s roots, to tap into the same energy that made Max mad in the first place. </p>

One gets lucky, the other doesn’t. Let’s set about changing that.</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere. You can support the project </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>via its Patreon</em></a></span><em>.</em></p></div><p><em>Master Key</em> is the 2D <em>Zelda</em> format distilled to its purest form. It’s a monochrome RPG in which you play an adorable fox, exploring an ever-growing territory as you earn new abilities that allow access to new areas. The map begins shrouded in clouds, each section revealed as you reach it, until you’ve discovered multiple biomes, temples, dungeons, and boss fights. And despite being “monochrome” (it defaults to black and white, with options in the settings to pick your own dual colour-scheme), it’s beautifully detailed, with a huge number of distinct enemy types, gorgeously animated, and each fought differently with your increasingly interesting range of attacks.<br></p><p>So yeah, that rather clinically explains that it delivers all the correct ingredients. What’s far more important is how well it’s done. <em>Master Key</em> is just so wonderfully crafted, a constant drip-feed of new abilities opening up new areas, letting you always feel as though you’re progressing. Reach a point where you’re stuck, and the world map (which I’m fairly certain is just the live game running at a tinier scale) will flash a region you should explore further. You’ll inevitably find the passageway you missed, or the secret entrance it’s hinting you toward, or the NPC with an item you need. And then there’s that dopamine hit of realising you’ve now got another whole swathe of game to explore.</p><p>There’s no talking in the game, other characters instead communicating in the simplest pictogram speech bubbles. And yet, everyone feels characterful. Where the game isn’t dumping exposition on me, I find I’m filling in the narrative for myself, imagining motivations for this little fox. It’s all adorable.</p><p>It’s also absolutely bursting with secrets, puzzles, and surprises. There are some pretty in-depth puzzles in there, some dungeons offering bespoke challenges that require a fair amount of head-scratching. At some points you’ll see rocks with peculiar patterns on them, and begin noting them down in case they become useful later. (Spoiler: they will.) Every area feels like it’s hiding something extra, making it always worth revisiting areas you’ve not seen for a while in case your bucket of new skills now lets you reach a formerly irrelevant-looking platform, or reveals an entire new dungeon.</p><p>The abilities are the ones any right-minded person desires. So yes, there’s a splendid hook-shot for so satisfactorily zipping across gaps, and of course a boomerang for bonking distant enemies, alongside a bunch more that are only discovered a lot later. Thorough exploration is always rewarded with more bonus items that will unlock more health, non-vital but lovely bonus abilities, and piles of lovely money. So a new ability is a fresh chance to gather loads more of that, too.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-recommend-id="image://d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-format="jpg" data-width="2265" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Achromi / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-recommend-id="image://d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-format="jpg" data-width="2265" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’ve gotten properly stuck a couple of times, and I’m not alone. But there’s already a small but lovely community on Steam swapping hints, and a thread dedicated to those in the end-game sharing discoveries of the game’s deepest secrets.

(Unfortunately the game hasn’t received any guides or YouTube walkthroughs yet, but hopefully if we all shout loudly enough about it, people will get more involved.)<br></p><p>This deserves to be a break-out success for developer Achromi, and it’s the eternal tale of frustration at the abysmal curation on Steam that it is not.

<p>In an official <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/marcus-teilman-resigns-from-the-position-of-ceo-at-his-own-request/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Fragbite confirmed that CEO Marcus Teilman has officially resigned, and Stefan Tengvall will now serve as an interim CEO. </p>



<p>The post explains that Teilman chose to resign in order to “pursue new challenges.” This remains quite vague, and the press release does not elaborate on Teilman’s plans. But Tengvall and the Board did thank him for his time as CEO.</p>



<p>Teilman will also “provide support to Stefan Tengvall” during the transitional period. Due to the shakeup, Sten Wranne will now take on Tengvall’s role as Chairman of the Board.</p>



<p>Tengvall elaborated on their goals as the interim CEO at Fragbite. They mentioned plans for a “cost reduction programme,” and “identifying opportunities for restructuring.” This may imply that serious reductions could be on the way, but that is only speculation.</p>



<p>The shift in leadership closely follows Fragbite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragbite-files-for-bankruptcy-for-fall-damage-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing for bankruptcy</a> for development studio Fall Damage. </p>



<p>Fragbite recently acquired Fall Damage in late 2023. However, a statement from Fragbite cited an “unsustainable financial situation,” following attempts to find a publisher for Fall Damage’s shooter Alara Prime.</p>



<p>Finding a publisher certainly seems more difficult as the industry remains rattled.  There are still plenty of layoffs, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two’s layoff announcement</a> from last April. But the search for an Alara Prime publisher still seems to be ongoing at this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-players-are-using-a-time-honored-trick-to-access-playable-characters-early<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Wuthering Waves’ global launch is suffering from a number of technical issues <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-developer-addresses-launch-issues-as-players-report-their-devices-are-overheating">that have forced developer Kuro Games to issue an apology and offer compensation</a>, but this latest exploit left some players hoping it sticks around for as long as possible.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/wuthering-waves">Wuthering Waves</a> is an open-world Genshin Impact-style Gacha game from Chinese studio Kuro that launched globally in free-to-play form across PC and mobile this week.</p><p>As revealed in a number of gameplay clips posted to Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili, Wuthering Waves players soon worked out that by manually changing the date in their system time settings after logging into the game, they were able to access an upcoming playable character called Yinlin.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/screenshot-2024-05-24-134109-1716554957516.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This appears to only unlock the trial for the character, set to be released officially as part of an event scheduled for mid-June, so the damage done to the live service should be limited. Still, the exploit has certainly caught the attention of Wuthering Waves’ burgeoning community, which is having a laugh about it all.</p><p>Tricking video games by changing the date has been a thing in video games for decades, of course, but in the case of a live-service, online open-world Gacha game like Wuthering Waves, players are now wondering what other exploits they might find by tinkering with time.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1cys6b6/comment/l5bq915/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players report</a> this exploit is patched for the Chinese client, but may still be available in the western version. Kuro Games will of course want to stamp this out globally as soon as possible, given it undermines the gacha mechanics that underpin Wuthering Waves’ monetization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The developer has plenty to be getting on with. The scale of the technical issues at launch was laid out in <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on the Wuthering Waves website</u></a>. There was a login timeout issue, now said to be fixed, a problem with age authentication, which is under investigation, forced logins every time the game client is relaunched on PC, crash issues, glitches on certain Android devices, poor quality localization, and performance issues including lag, freezes, frame-rate drops, devices overheating, blurry graphics, and force quits. An emergency patch was issued to address the most urgent issues, but Kuro advised those still experiencing serious overheating or frequent crashes to lower the graphics settings “in the case of an overload for a smoother gaming experience.”</p><p>Similar to Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves features a gacha mechanic for obtaining new <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuthering-waves/Wuthering_Waves_Characters_(Resonators)"><u>characters</u></a> and weapons — see our guide for more details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuthering-waves/How_to_Wish:_When_Can_You_Pull_in_Wuthering_Waves"><u>how to unlock pulling</u></a>, plus our in-progress <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuthering-waves/Wuthering_Waves_Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>walkthrough</u></a> to help you get started. To celebrate Wuthering Waves' launch, Kuro Games is also issuing in-game rewards via <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuthering-waves/Wuthering_Waves_Codes_May_2024"><u>promo codes</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-horizon-and-john-wick-star-lance-reddick-dies-at-60/1100-6512458/" data-ref-id="1100-6512458">Lance Reddick passed away</a> shortly before one of his final films, John Wick: Chapter 4, hit theaters. Reddick had a long list of credits to his name, including Commander Zavala in the Destiny video game franchise, a role that he originated in 2014. Zavala is set to return in the next expansion of Destiny 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>, with veteran actor Keith David taking over the part from Reddick. Now, Bungie has shared a brief glimpse at David's first appearance as Zavala.</p><p>The footage featuring David as Zavala was part of Bungie's short documentary series about the making of The Final Shape. Both clips are extremely brief, but they seem to have a larger meta meaning beyond the game as Zavala mourns for an unseen comrade whom he says he would give anything to bring them back. In the second scene, Zavala vows not to lose another soldier to the war.</p><p>Reddick was more than just an actor in the Destiny games, he was also an avid player <a href="https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-destiny-2-zavala-voice-bungie-tribute-1850243218" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who logged on to play Destiny 2</a> the night before he died. Additionally, Reddick frequently interacted with Destiny fans online. His connection to the other players was so profound that they staged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-players-paying-tribute-to-lance-reddicks-commander-zavala-in-game/1100-6512463/" data-ref-id="1100-6512463">an in-game tribute to the late actor</a>. Reddick's final contributions to the series were released last year.</p><p>Destiny: The Final Shape will be released on June 4.</p>

In an interview with Game Developer about the past and future of Saber, Karch stood by that stance, and said criticism of Wingefors and leadership has not been fair.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I know Lars better than most people do. He's not a terribly extroverted person—he's quiet, he's unassuming, and he means well. He's taken a tremendous amount of abuse," Karch argued. Seeing a slew of critical—and what were undoubtedly sometimes hostile—comments made him reach for the keyboard and proclaim that he still believed in the beleaguered Swedish conglomerate.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/why-saber-interactive-s-focus-on-in-house-technology-is-what-s-made-it-sustainable" target="_self">What's made Saber Interactive such a long-lasting studio?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he stands by those comments—and in our conversation, shared his thinking not just about the attacks on his friend, but why Embracer's drastic action will ultimately be good for the company.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Karch says his former Embracer colleagues are &quot;like family&quot;">Karch says his former Embracer colleagues are "like family"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was surprising how in so many ways Karch's defense of Wingefors and Embracer felt—relatable. Not relatable in a "everybody makes mistakes" kind of way, but relatable in a "I logged onto social media and had to yell about someone being wrong on the internet," kind of way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Karch described logging onto LinkedIn and being bombarded by posts and opinions about the state of Embracer. He hadn't even jumped on to do any particular business, he logged in for the same reason most of us do to any social media platform: he was just idly scrolling. After seeing so many comments—some harsh, some "untrue"—and he felt "compelled" to post a response.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Not saying something is worse than being negative about him or going out and saying something outwardly bad," he said (it seemed he was referring to himself and his position as a former Embracer board member).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that so many of the comments bothering Karch came from game industry professionals made it "really hurt." ("It probably hurt me more than it hurt him, because he's so used to hearing it," he admitted).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the comments he saw were incorrect—some professionals lambasted Wingefors for buying Gearbox for over $1 billion and selling it for $460 million. Embracer merged with Gearbox in 2023 for a day-one purchase of $363 million—the deal was just reported to eventually cost a total of $1.6 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But he also took issue with comments saying Embracer's board was full of "terrible people" for laying off so many developers. As interim COO and a former board member, Karch had a firsthand look at the company's financials and felt closer to the situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He did say it was "irresponsible" to grow as fast as the company did, because such a strategy relied on either never-ending growth or at least access to never-ending capital. He also said Wingefors pursued that strategy in part to ensure he could "keep his promises" to everybody. "That slowed down his ability to make necessary changes earlier in the process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through it all Karch emphasized that Wingefors had the best intentions—that hindsight is 20/20 and that no one could have seen such a major market shift coming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that left us asking—if it's not fair to harshly criticize Wingefors' leadership, who is accountable for the destruction of so many jobs?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Layoffs are inevitable&quot;">"Layoffs are inevitable"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are two sides to Karch's perspective on Embracer's implosion. First, in the early days of Saber Interactive, he says he didn't take a salary for the company for "ten years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I didn't even know how I was gonna survive," he recalled. He's been through the feast and famine of game development, and worked hard to build a studio that can survive hard times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But flip the coin over, and you'll find the former interim COO of Embracer, who took on the role of "the bad guy" when evaluating whether to shut down studios and cancel games. He said he reviewed many of the games in development at Embracer subsidiaries and identified a number that would have been "not good." "At that point you either put the team on something else, or you close down, or you reduce the team size," he said. "When money is tight, you have no choice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he departed Embracer because he was "insistent" the company needed to do more of that. Certain studios, he said, should never have been started in the first place. He called out one subsidiary with a team of what he said were inexperienced developers that had never shipped a game before, pouring millions of dollars into a game licensed from a major franchise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After a long period of time, there was nothing really to show for it," he said. "Their goal was basically to start anew." He said it didn't give him any pleasure to argue that the studio had to be shut down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(It's only the description that this studio was new and founded with people who "hadn't shipped a game before" that keeps it from sounding like Aspyr's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-aspyr-s-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-on-pause">ill-fated work</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In a follow-up email a Saber spokesperson declined to state which studio Karch was referring to.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a tangible thread to Karch's perspective. At a nuts-and-bolts level, a studio making a game whose costs will wildly exceed potential revenue isn't sustainable. If it can't pay people, it will shut down, and someone has to make the call when that time has come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the anger at Embracer—and by proxy, Wingefors—is rooted in the fact that he and his colleagues who greenlit these projects won't lose their income, their health insurance, or their career prospects as a result of these failures. The accountability for its financial mistakes was placed on the people with zero input on how they were made in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's understandable why so many in game development feel that status quo—and not criticism of Wingefors—is what's actually unfair.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week has gone by, and as ever, the gaming industry has done everything but stand still. This week, we've seen layoff roundups, final farewells from studios, and a buyout for some big names in the publishing world as well.</p>

<p>Here's our roundup of what's been happening in the world of gaming business this week.</p>

<h2>PlayStation London's final farewell</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-london-blood-and-truth-gaming-business.jpg?itok=0huGSs2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-london-blood-and-truth-gaming-business.jpg?itok=kxUcEMMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>PlayStation London's projects include VR game&nbsp;<em>Blood and Truth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in February, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">was announced</a> that PlayStation London Studio, best known for games like&nbsp;<em>SingStar</em>, would be shut down, and this week, the studio said its final farewell before closing its doors.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), London Studio thanked its players and colleagues, describing its time in the industry as "one wild and wonderful journey" while also looking ahead to the "new adventures" its staff will be embarking on.</p>

<h2>Fragbite says&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Fall Damage Studio is bankrupt</h2>

<p>In October last year, Fragbite <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-ab-publ-acquires-fall-damage-studio-ab-and-evaluates-the-conditions-to-carry-out-a-directed-issue-of-units/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Fall Damage Studio</a> for SEK 20 million (roughly $1.9 million).</p>

<p>This week, however, Fragbite <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-declares-subsidiary-fall-damage-studio-bankrupt/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a> that Fall Damage is bankrupt, having failed to secure a publisher for&nbsp;<em>Alara Prime</em>. The game is still in development, however, and it doesn't seem that Fall Damage will be shut down (at least not yet).</p>

<p>Fragbite CEO Marcus Teilman did, however, <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/marcus-teilman-resigns-from-the-position-of-ceo-at-his-own-request/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resign from his position</a> this week, with current chairman Stefan Tengvall taking the role of interim CEO while the search for a permanent replacement is underway.</p>

<h2>IGN's parent company buys the Gamer Network</h2>

<p>The Gamer Network...uh, network, which includes publications like Eurogamer, GamesIndustry.biz, and Rock Paper Shotgun, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought this week</a> by IGN Entertainment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GI.biz</a>, the buyout has led to "some redundancies" across the network. The sale doesn't include EGX, nor does it include Comic-Con company MCM or ReedPop's Popverse.</p>

<h2>Industry layoff woes continue</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palia-layoffs-singularity-6.jpg?itok=8p2AuoeD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palia-layoffs-singularity-6.jpg?itok=fmvC1iHe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Singularity 6 was hit with more layoffs last week.</figcaption></figure><p>A web archive that tracks gaming layoffs across the industry showed this week that the total number of layoffs has <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already reached over 10,000</a> for 2024 alone.</p>

<p>This tally includes almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">2,000 layoffs across Microsoft</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">1,800 layoffs at Unity</a>, 670 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">Electronic Arts layoffs</a>, and around 600 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two Interactive employees</a> being cut from the company.</p>

<p>Although the archive doesn't include Modus Games' parent company Maximum Entertainment, that studio <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/d1fbf7e0-da83-4aad-85a2-60ec973916cf/me-interim-q12024-report-eng-vf.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released its Q1 2024</a> report this week, and it showed that Maximum has laid off almost 10% of its workforce since December last year.</p>

            <p>
Avalanche founder Christofer Sundberg has hit back at Mad Max film director George Miller for claiming the studio's game "wasn't as good as [he] wanted it to be".
</p>
<p>
During promotion for the new Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga film, Miller was asked by <a href="https://x.com/gamingbible/status/1792566156810756105">GamingBible</a> about whether a new game was considered alongside the film.
</p>
<p>
He responded that Avalanche's previous game "wasn't as good as I wanted it to be", adding "I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level". He then said he'd love for Hideo Kojima to take on the challenge of a Mad Max game - because, of course.

<p>

Sundberg has since hit back at Miller, stating "this is complete nonsense" that shows his "complete arrogance".
</p>
<p>
"They did everything they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open-world games," wrote Sundberg on X. "I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "After the first year of development they realised that they had forced us to make a linear experience rather than the open world game we pitched. We threw away a year of work and got to hear that 'players want autonomy in this day and age'. Well, no shit..."

<p>Larian Studios director of publishing Michael Douse also weighed in, claiming the developers didn't have access to the film assets, which made it "pretty difficult to capture the spirit of it when legal is precious about IP". He added: "A 'small' nuance probably Miller doesn't even know."</p> <div>

<p>
Mad Max was released by Avalanche (and publisher Warner Bros. Games) in 2015 on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, the same year as the film Mad Max: Fury Road. It was a third-person open world action-adventure game inspired by the Mad Max franchise, but separate to any specific film.
</p>
<p>
This followed the studio's work on the Just Cause open world games it was known for. Just Cause 3 was released shortly after Mad Max.
</p>
<p>
Mad Max received mixed reviews - not the "highest level" Miller was expecting - but has since been considered something of an underrated gem. 
</p>
<p>
"Like Shadow of Mordor before it, Mad Max sees Warner Bros thoughtfully apply its filmic property to an open world," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mad-max-review">Eurogamer Mad Max review</a>.

If you are looking to get your hands on Dave the Diver's free Godzilla DLC, there is a limited time you will be able to do so. 
</p>
<p>
This DLC adds three new missions to Dave the Diver, each of which will be available after chapter five's close. There are also new dishes to discover, and a number of Godzilla figures scattered throughout the ocean for players to collect. 
</p>
<p>
You can see a little teaser for Dave the Diver's Godzilla DLC in the video below.

<p>
The DLC is out now across Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStations 5 and PS4. However, it will be delisted on 23rd November, and will no longer be available to download after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Developer Mintrocket stated as long as the DLC has been downloaded before this date, it will remain accessible, don't worry. Players will also be able to delete the DLC and reinstall it should the mood take their fancy after the end of the distribution period. 
</p>
<p>
Along with this new content, Mintrocket has also made a few other adjustments across the game, including adding controller vibrations to certain cutscenes and improving the design of some DLC icons.

You can read more about what's new in Dave the Diver via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4145079037715714518">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, if you're still yet to give it a go for yourself, we fully recommend that you do. Our Donlan actually described it as "one of the most generous games in years" when he played it.
</p>
<p>
"Dave the Diver isn't a complicated game, but it can be a very busy one. I mean this as a compliment. From a simple core, it builds outwards in unlikely and enchanting ways. But that core keeps everything from becoming bewildering," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">Eurogamer's five star Dave the Diver review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/rafal-wlosek-discusses-alters-strategy-on-smaller-scale-and-his-favorite-alter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While in Poland last week playing upcoming 11Bit games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale"><em>The Alters</em></a> and <em>Frostpunk 2,&nbsp;</em>I had the opportunity to chat in depth with Rafał Włosek, Lead Designer behind <em>The Alters</em>, about what led Jan Dolski to being part of Project Dolly, what it was like to design each of the Alters, and what players can expect as they dive further into the game.</p>

<h2>How Did Jan Find Himself In Space</h2>

<p>To learn more about Jan himself I asked what it was that led Jan to be on this voyage to a different planet in search of a material such as Rapidium. I was also interested in the inception of the idea of <em>The Alters.</em> Unfortunately for Jan, that's not a very happy story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-tree-of-life.jpg?itok=WVYsWQnk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-tree-of-life.jpg?itok=uhmbcJkQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of the nodes on the Tree of Life showing that altering this would lead Jan to become a Refiner</figcaption></figure><p>Włosek explained that "Jan is a person who's trying to figure out what to do next in his life. He's not happy about his decisions." Włosek referenced that Jan's life up until this point has been filled with hardship from birth, something you get to see represented on the Tree of Life.</p>

<p>It was also joked that while Jan had a lot of reasons to be there, 11Bit put him there because they "wanted someone to crash in space."</p>

<p>On the topic of the Alters themselves, it was explained that Włosek and the rest of the creative team were interested in the idea of what people we would be or "Who would we become if we were a bit different? Different choices in our life, what would become of us, and what people would end up around us?"</p>

<h2>At Its Core,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em> Is A Strategy Game</h2>

<p>This was the basic idea that the development team started with. Being 11Bit though, they added what they're good at: strategy games.</p>

<p>"We started from this idea, but the more we focused on the topic, the more we understood that we need to have a clear narration and storyline,"&nbsp;Włosek said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We built upon the storyline, adding more emerging stuff like the stories of each Alter. While you can have different Alters you cannot have all of them in one game. The difficulty of the emerging storylines is how they react to what you do."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asking for an example of how the different Alters would lead to differences in gameplay, Włosek used the River of Lava that you encounter in Act 1 as an example.</p>

<p>"The way you overcome the problem is always the same, you build a bridge, but there is a lot that may happen on the level of the Alters," he said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-exterior-terrain.jpg?itok=CG-JDsUR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-exterior-terrain.jpg?itok=x1BPGaXB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A river of lava is the first of what will be many obstacles for Jan.</figcaption></figure><p>"What technology you will develop, how you will treat your Alters, if you want to push them or treat them well," Włosek continued, "it's a strategy game and the different talents of your Alters will be better in different situations."</p>

<h2>Internal Conflict Between Me, Myself, And I</h2>

<p>The Alters won't just be reacting to issues, but can also cause a variety of issues. The different Jans will all have different ways that they react to decisions, and depending on which Jans you've created, there won't always be a "correct" way out of a situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Whatever version of Jan you create, they're not always entirely happy about your decisions, so they have different problems."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your playthrough of <em>The Alters</em>, you'll always begin with the regular Jan you play as, the Technician, and the Scientist. These Alters are important to repair the ship and give you access to the research Tech Tree. From there all other Alters are decided by the player themselves. You could have a Miner or a Botanist, but they're all still built around the same foundation.</p>

<p>"The foundation is pretty solid, but then, every Alter has a different story,"&nbsp;Włosek said. "You'll see them showing anxiety and other emotions, and interacting with them will change that. You can please them or piss them off."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-ship-building-2.jpg?itok=_d9TxqvR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-ship-building-2.jpg?itok=heUGllI8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll need to create living spaces for each of your Alters, but you can also start to have space issues</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing you could piss them off I had to know just how far you could go.</p>

<p>"If they're not happy, they will probably work less and not support you," Włosek said. "They'll start as your friends and then they will not like you. Finally, they will stop talking with you and eventually will rebel against you and just decide that they are the guys who can do it better than you." Włosek described this as a game over state.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, if you're good at handling them and understanding them, they will help you, support you, and will want you to succeed."</p>

<h2>How Were New Jans Created?</h2>

<p>Knowing that each Jan spawned from a different change along the timeline and that those changes led them to different places in life, Włosek explained how they approached creating each new Alter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-trailer-multiple-jans.jpg?itok=OP3KEAnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-trailer-multiple-jans.jpg?itok=hiComPAq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Jan has a different look and personality.</figcaption></figure><p>I had originally wondered if there was a core element that made them all 'Jan' but Włosek corrected me. "We didn't look at it from that perspective. We liked to ask ourselves 'What decision?' What would be the decision made that the players could refer to and understand from their own life."</p>

<h2>A Favorite Alter; Gameplay or Personality</h2>

<p>If there were only a limited number of Alters that you could create in a single playthrough I did wonder what Włosek's favorite was. He explained that as a system designer, the answer was more complex than I was probably expecting.</p>

<p>"You can create a miner. You're mining things so if you create a miner, they will improve your abilities and it's easy to use for a beginner," Włosek said. "The more you play the game, the more interesting strategies you'll see with different Alters. Because of how I like to connect things, I don't have a single favorite Alter in terms of usefulness."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-sharing-a-meal.jpg?itok=ymorKgH- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-sharing-a-meal.jpg?itok=QFsUgj-Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sharing common memories can lead to some nice moments on the ship.</figcaption></figure><p>Włosek went on to explain that a character like the Doctor might be a smart choice to make sure all of your Alters are healthy, but you'll also learn that his life choices led him to be a good cook. "If you create a good meal, that will make everyone happy. This can allow you to create special outcomes."</p>

<p>Not taking gameplay into account though, Włosek admitted that he liked the Refiner "because he's a cool guy but he also has an interesting story." Włosek also spoke highly of the Worker for how well he was written but that he would probably hate him in real life.</p>

<h2>How Long Is <em>The Alters</em>?</h2>

<p>While a lot about <em>The Alters</em>, including its release date, is currently shrouded in mystery, I did want to see if I could understand how long the game is, especially with the idea of replayability in mind.</p>

<p>Włosek wasn't able to give me a concrete timeframe, but he did tease to me that from the original scope of the game from when they began development to now, "it's at least twice as long as [11Bit] was aiming, and I'm only talking about a single playthrough."</p>

<p>Avowed and Indiana Jones previews will be shown on June 10th, one day after the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that both Avowed and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be playable to select media outlets and content creators at this year’s Summer Game Fest. According to those familiar with the plans, both games are expected to be shown at this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, with previews from the hands-on going live on June 10.</p>



<p>Avowed and Indiana Jones have been given a vague 2024 release date, so we’re reasonably confident that both games will also get a definite release date at the event.</p>



<p>During the January 2024 developer direct, we already got a decent look at both Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed and Bethesda’s Indiana Jones and as we’ll be getting hands-on previews soon after the showcase, we wouldn’t expect anything more than hype trailers and release dates this time around.</p>



<p>As for other games at the Xbox Games Showcase, keep your eyes peeled on Insider Gaming for the latest, as we’ll have more details soon.</p>



<p>Immediately following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, Xbox will also hold a unique Black Ops 6 direct, which will offer an unprecedented deep-dive into the game.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see the hands-on gameplay of Avowed and Indiana Jones? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

    <p><span>Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos join the fray, plus a sneak peak into the nation of Natlan.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 4.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [114 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “An Everlasting Dream Intertwined,” will launch on June 5, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-884608"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The latest update brings us three new playable characters, Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos, another long-term Challenge Domain aside from the well-known Spiral Abyss, and a new tower-defense mini-game event. Meanwhile, with the Archon Quest progressing, more secrets about Khaenri’ah will be uncovered as the twin Travelers and Dainsleif meet once again.</p><p>Starting from July 1, a fresh monthly-reset challenge domain “Imaginarium Theater” will emerge in a hidden chamber within Mondstadt Library, and the Spiral Abyss will shift to a monthly update cycle on the 16th day of each month. Imaginarium Theater offers combat challenges of multiple difficulty levels but allows only characters of designated elements (plus a few exceptions) to participate, with a limit on the number of times they can fight. During the challenge, players will receive a variety of buffs and debuffs, and will be able to gradually assemble and adjust their team builds from the characters they own, the initial lineup of six designated characters preset by the domain, friends’ Supporting Cast characters, and a few special guests.</p><p>More challenge domains also provide richer rewards. The current “Imaginarium Theater” rewards its champions with up to Primogems ×620 per month, a series of new photo poses for certain characters, new bonuses for first-time completion, and “Fantastical Blessings” that will apply in the open world for the six designated characters of the month. Meanwhile, the total amount of Primogem rewards from Floors 9 to 12 of the Spiral Abyss will be increased to 800.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884609"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In the wake of Arlecchino, we’ll also be seeing the arrival of two more playable characters who can utilize the Bond of Life mechanic in different ways. Clorinde is a Champion Duelist of Fontaine and a five-star Electro sword wielder. When she is in the “Night Vigil” state, Clorinde can alternate between different attack styles, using piercing pistolet attacks to accumulate Bond of Life and a powerful lunging sword attack that clears her Bond of Life and restores her HP. Healing effects she receives through other means during her “Night Vigil” state are added to her Bond of Life instead of her HP. Sigewinne, on the other hand—as a Melusine and the Fortress of Meropide’s head nurse — uses Bond of Life to help her teammates. Her healing will be increased based on the total Bond of Life values across all the characters in her party. In combat, Sigewinne can fire a giant bouncing bubble to trap and attack nearby enemies, as well as to heal and buff her team.</p><p>Aside from these two Fontainian characters, we’ll also see the arrival of the new four-star archer Sethos who can fire piercing Electro arrows in combat. Sethos’s Charge Level 2 attack restricts his movements but fires a formidable, piercing shot. But the successor to the Temple of Silence can initiate a ritual with his Elemental Skill, consuming Elemental Energy to shorten the charging time, then restoring it whenever his attacks trigger any type of Electro-related Elemental Reaction. His Elemental Burst can also fire consecutive enemy-piercing bolts.</p><p>In the Version 4.7 Event Wishes, Clorinde and Sethos will feature in the first half with Alhaitham’s rerun, while the second half will feature Sigewinne alongside <a title="Games > Furi [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/furi">Furi</a>na’s rerun. Clorinde and Sigewinne’s Story <a title="Platforms > Quest [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s will also become available for Travelers.</p><p>More mini-games and optimizations will also be coming with Version 4.7. The new <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense</a> mini-game “Mutual Security Enhancing <a title="Genres > Simulation [472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a>” allows players to deploy their own monster troops in offensive or defensive games. On top of this, to further enhance the daily gaming experience, the Original Resin cap will increase from 160 to 200.</p><p>And a one-minute video clip of Natlan was shown at the end of today’s <em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 4.7 Special Program, providing us with a glimpse into the all-new nation arriving later this year.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,073 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,720 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>The last couple of weeks have been pretty demoralizing in Helldivers 2, but developer Arrowhead is looking to motivate its community with a chance to unlock a shiny new mech. This week's major order is live, and it's simple enough: Valyria 5 needs to be liberated and players need to take over an Automaton "petafactory" before it's too late.</p><p>The reward for this objective will be a new mech-suit strategem: the EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit.

        <p>Stefan Tengvall named interim CEO, gaming and esports firm initiates cost reduction program</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Marcus Teilman, the CEO of gaming and esports firm Fragbite Group, has resigned from his position.</p>
<p>The company said he will leave to "pursue new challenges," and will be replaced by chairman of the group's board of directors Stefan Tengvall on an interim basis. Tengvall will step down as chairman and will be replaced by current board member Sten Wranne.</p>
<p>Teilman worked at Fragbite for over three years, originally joining as deputy CEO and head of M&amp;A.</p>
<p>In his comments on the leadership changes, Tengvall announced the company has begun a cost reduction programme, which may identify opportunities for restructuring. This will be his main focus as he takes on the role of interim CEO.</p>
<p>"The Board and I thank Marcus for his efforts and his commitment to Fragbite Group during his time as CEO and wish him the best of luck in the future," said Tengvall.</p>
<p>The news of Teilman's departure was announced on the same day Fragbite revealed it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fragbite-declares-bankruptcy-for-developer-fall-damage-studio-seven-months-after-acquisition">declaring bankruptcy for subsidiary Fall Damage Studio</a> after the developer struggled to find a publisher for its upcoming game, Alara Prime.</p>

"We control our own technology," he explained. "That's partially because our company was [co-founded] by engineers who think about things from a very, very technical perspective."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He's referring here to Anton Krupkin and Andrey Iones, Karch's friends and business partners who hailed from far across the Atlantic. Their maintenance of Saber3D allowed it to fuel games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World War Z</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warhammer 40,000:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which both take advantage of the engine's capabilities to push the number of units and quality of environments that can render onscreen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We use Unreal for certain games, but those are games that don't really require the same level of technical proficiency," he added, going so far as to say developers shook up by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-apologizes-to-devs-reveals-updated-runtime-fee-policy">Unity's runtime fee debacle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> should feel comfortable pivoting to Epic Games' popular licensed engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Iones, Krupkin, and other early employees still at the company (an ever-growing rarity), there's an immense amount of retained knowledge about Saber3D's ins and outs. There's a centralized core technology team that keeps it updated and humming along—both the front-end systems (named "Prose") and the back-end systems (called "Hydra") are under that team's purview.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the company is working toward a major release like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that team is solely dedicated toward supporting that game. "That's one of the reasons when we one of our own projects, we try to not release them at the same time," he said, noting the company will sometimes "hold" games to ensure the Saber3D developers aren't overstretched.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like Epic Games' work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leads to improvements in Unreal Engine, Saber3D gets a bit better with each project.

It was an early example of distributed development, one that's served served the studio in the years since.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The international operation was an "organic" phenomenon, Karch said, simply based on the home countries of the three men.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those dual offices have since evolved into a sea of global studios (some built by Saber, others being subsidiaries absorbed from its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-divests-core-saber-interactive-assets-in-deal-worth-247-million">divestment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Embracer Group). Saber isn't stationed in Russia anymore, as the country's invasion of Ukraine led to the last employees in the nation decamping in order to keep working with their Western colleagues, joining </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/rovio-zynga-and-supercell-suspend-operations-in-russia-and-belarus">many other developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who've divested from the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TimeShift</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> days, Karch said the team balanced American management, design, and cultural sensibilities with talented St. Petersburg-based developers taking ownership of developing and utilizing Saber3D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio's expansion was "slow and deliberate," Karch said, and built off the principle of keeping projects in scope of what its in-house engine was capable of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The division of labor across national borders raises an interesting question: as more studios turn towards international co-development partners to take advantage of lower labor costs in other regions, an uncomfortable dynamic sometimes emerges. In some of these relationships, game studios in the Western world will have creative ownership over a project, and the "grunt work" goes to the outsourced studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [dynamic] happens primarily when it's not organic," Karch said, explaining that now the technical and creative relationships between studios crisscross the globe. "Our lead designer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Marine 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he's been with us about 15 years. He moved out of Russia, lives in Armenia, and has full ownership over the game. He works closely with one of our lead writers...who's based out of Liverpool" (near Warhammer license-holder Games Workshop).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He rattled off the other studios' locations in Portugal, Spain, Serbia, Estonia, and the United States. He'd called in from Nimble Giant Entertainment in Argentina.

Now, thanks to its dedicated modding scene, the game offers a worthwhile lesson to you and your party—to realize that you are all Kenough.</p> <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Thanks to mod author lokelaniii, any <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> PC player can download Ken’s Mojo Dojo Wardrobe from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and start dressing their party like they’re straight out of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/barbie-corvette-hummer-coming-to-forza-horizon-5-dlc/">Barbie Movie</a></em>. There are five top options to choose from: an honest-to-goodness pair of jorts, white bellbottoms, some sparkly cowboy boots, and a matching pair of sparkly glasses and hat to complete the look. Your enemies will never know what hit them because they’ll be blinded by your sequinned splendor. </p>

Let’s face it: we all care about how our character looks and what everyone else in and out of the party back at camp is wearing, too. It’s genuinely distracting if a character hasn’t changed their outfit for a day or so, and we’ve all stripped everyone down to their underwear to see the wide range the game has to offer. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">I first spotted the mod thanks to <a href="https://x.com/astarielx/status/1793928933559423338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astarial on Twitter</a>, who has posted three absolutely amazing images of Astarion donning an “I am Kenough”crop top, some cowboy boots with purple sequin highlights, and the best-looking pair of jorts I’ve ever seen in a video game. </p> <figure data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">If you download Ken’s Mojo Dojo Wardrobe for your next playthrough, then make sure you read through the notes carefully. The cosmetics are available for BT2, BT4, and BT2 Githyanki, and the glasses are a character creation item, so you’ll need to use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appearance Edit Enhanced mod</a> to get them onto your companions. </p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Once installed, you’ll find all the modded clothing in the tutorial chest. If you have any issues, then you can reach out to the mod author on the Nexus Mods page through the Discord link there. They say you need to have some level of experience with<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mods-in-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3 mods</a></em> to get this one working, but I think the end result more than justifies any amount of effort and learning you’ve got to put in. </p>

I think the outfits look amazing and fit in the game world surprisingly well. They don’t look wet or clip through character models too much like other mods, and I could imagine that if you don’t look too closely until you reach a conversation or cutscene, you might even forget your characters are wearing them until you burst out laughing while being threatened by a group of angry Goblins. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/capes-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Capes is exciting. It’s a turn-based strategy game similar, gameplay-wise, to the X-Com series, but instead of defending the planet from an alien threat you’re leading a team of superheroes. Rather than shooting guns at extra-terrestrials, you’re telekinetically shooting chunks of rock at them, or teleporting to and then stabbing them, or sometimes just punching them, but it a super heroic way. If you want another comparison, it’s a lower budget, non-Marvel Midnight Sons, but with proper movement and no card system for your attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capes: Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9Yn-Fg90PM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will begin with the game’s presentation, which is…okay. Graphically speaking it isn’t going to blow any minds, even the heroes’ ultimate attacks don’t really impress on that front, but it’s good enough to get the job done and combine with a few aesthetic choices that I like. Things like dialogue being presented with comic-style dialogue boxes in addition to being fully voice acted and some basic, but effective direction in cutscenes when establishing the area a level is set in.</p>


<p>It sounds pretty good too, voice acting is competent-to-good throughout, though there are a few anomalies with the levels on certain clips, where Weathervane’s ultimate scream is way too quiet. The dialogue they’re dealt is sufficiently comic book as well, with just that right amount of tongue-in-cheek campiness present in everywhere from the street level goons to the mustache twirling supervillains. It’s just enough to sell the comic styling outside of the cutscenes at base, which are actually cartoon rather than the 3D graphics of in-game. You won’t spend much time back at base, instead characters will pop up over a mostly static background for a conversation, each of them apparently unable to stand still as they have the exaggerated stances of Street Fighter characters, before you jet off for another mission.</p>
<p>These missions will take you all over King City, a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime punishable by being taken away, never to be seen again. The city is a dark, dangerous place where The Company is more than happy to kidnap supers and forcibly silence any witnesses, which is where your team of ragtag superheroes comes in. Gathered together by a mysterious man known as Doctrine to free King City from The Company, your team of heroes are young people who have recently come into their powers. These include, but are certainly not limited to, Facet, who can summon crystal shards as armour to reduce damage or to entangle and block enemies, Rebound, who can teleport around and deal extra damage on backstabs, and Weathervane, who can shoot lightning that chains between nearby enemies.</p>


<p>In combat, there are lot of ways these characters can team up, both literally and just with clever planning. Certain abilities can be enhanced if you are in range of another character – for example, Weathervane can add a gust of wind to one of Facet’s melee attacks to add a knockback effect. Alternatively, if a character is in range of rebound they can spend an action to have her teleport them somewhere. Facet’s crystal growth can conduct electricity, so with some strategic placement you can set it up so that Weathervane can damage more enemies with his chain lightning. Another hero named Mercurial is a Speedster (like the Flash) and has an ability that dashes a long distance, but when upgraded by Facet it leaves crystal growth along its entire route, which is very helpful for when you want to chain lightning every enemy in a level.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, these team up abilities are very powerful, which is good, because Capes is <em>tough</em>. It doesn’t mess around when it comes to throwing enemies at you, constantly bringing in more groups of enemies in numbers that, frankly, seem overwhelming when it first starts happening. With careful use of team ups, meticulous positioning, and heavy use of bottle necks you’ll find that it’s not quite as bad as you think. Especially when you realise that you can knock enemies through surrounding walls where they will fall to an instant death.</p>
<p>There are a few issues though. Certain abilities are so useful that they are basically essential. Facet is the only character I currently have that can soak up a lot of damage due to his crystal armour’s damage reduction and, considering the sheer number of enemies that tend to appear, I’ve taken to him always being in my group of four. Rebound can teleport and, as such, isn’t affected by terrain when aiming attacks, and her main attack is ranger teleport, so she doesn’t take reaction damage, so she’s always in there, too. Weathervane and Mercurial always finish up my team, because of the big growth-dash-chain lightning combo I’ve already mentioned, which is disproportionately helpful as you can have Mercurial connect up groups of enemies as they arrive and then run away so Weathervane can damage all of them at once.</p>

<p>Each hero has an ultimate which is charged differently depending on the character – Weathervane’s is charged by hitting people with chain lightning. If you set it up right you can have him using his ultimate, which damages <em>every enemy</em> in a reasonable radius, every round on top of the one damage from the lightning <em>and</em> his second action, because ultimates are free actions. It’s unbelievably useful, especially since there are objectives in the levels like defending hostages and the Facet’s growths also act like walls, blocking enemy movement.</p>
<p>This is all very cool, but the other heroes that I don’t use because my main team is so effective must be a little lonely by now. They have their uses, but they’re not quite as effective as damaging every enemy on the field plus an ultimate every round. Your heroes all level up using Skill Points that are earned not just from completing levels, but from bonus objectives on those levels as well. You can “simulate” previous levels to retry them and earn some extra SP, complete with your now likely significantly more powerful heroes, and they’ll even earn XP whilst they do it. The SP is shared between all heroes, which is useful in that you can spend SP on lesser used heroes to beef them up a bit, but it mostly resulted in me favouring my main four heroes and leaving the others very underpowered, as I didn’t want to constantly replay levels to level them up.</p>
<p>There is one other issue with combat – frustration. On top of the shocking amounts of enemies, some of them have abilities that seem almost unfair and really limit your options. Some enemies have a free action they can fire from a chest cannon at anyone who’s within a very long range in any of the cardinal directions every turn, so if you leave your hero in range they’ll take a hit in addition to the enemy’s turn. This might seem fine, except that some of these levels have like twelve of these bastards and you can only see the range of each one when you highlight it, which, when positioning characters, is time consuming at best. Most importantly, it feels <em>cheap</em>, which is discouraging in a strategy game.</p>

<p>Other enemies have their own free attacks that need to be disarmed before they trigger to avoid damage, forcing you to damage them less in favour of stopping an attack that won’t feel satisfying in a moment when it’s their turn and they still have an attack anyway. There are even stealth sections, where you can see enemy’s sight range and maneouvre around them taking enemies out without them noticing. I actually love this idea, but again, you need to highlight enemies to see their paths for next turn, and there tend to be a lot of enemies to keep track of – just the abilitiy to see all enemy paths at once would make a big difference.</p>
<p>There are a few little niggly bugs and glitches, like the camera clipping through the environment during attacks so you can’t actually see, the HUD sometimes missing elements like whether an enemy will take damage from displacement into objects/drops, or some fiddly UI, especially in the level up menu. But despite this list of small niggles, I really like Capes. It takes the Midnight Sons formula and adds proper levels and positioning into it, whilst removing the randomness of the cards. It’s a great idea that’s mostly well delivered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> is a video game developed and published by <a href="https://11bitstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 bit studios</a>. A large part of this team also created the outstanding <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/this-war-of-mine-the-little-ones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This War of Mine</a>. That is the extent of what I knew about The Alters, going into my time recently spent in Warsaw with the studio, and it was honestly all I needed to know. From the Anomaly games to This War of Mine and Frostpunk, 11 Bit Studios is a developer I trust (also as a publisher, following titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/moonlighter-worth-staying-up-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonlighter</a>, Children of Morta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>), so my recent hands-on time with The Alters and the story mode of Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview of the earlier beta here</a>) offered an opportunity to see if that trust would remain after an early look.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 coverage will be in a few days, so I won't say more than my trust remains unsullied. Speaking solely about The Alters, from a game I knew nothing about except what was mentioned above and the nice amount of pink on show in the trailer, I'm now waiting for it to release because I want to play more.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>So, what is The Alters? From what I've seen and been told, the best way I can describe it is that it's a story-driven third-person adventure game with survival elements and base-building mechanics. The theme of the game is the question the title of this preview asks: "What if?" What if you had decided to become a fluffer instead of a politician - Would you be happier with your life and feel less dirty? What if you were less careful when burying the corpse of your latest Tinder date? These are essential questions we all face in life and those that Jan Dolski will face.</p>
<p>Jan Dolski, voiced multiple times by Alex Jordan (Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Dragons Dogma 2, Final Fantasy XVI, Troy: A Total War Saga, Blasphemous, and many more), is stranded on an alien planet and is all by himself. He needs others to survive, so he will create alternate versions of himself where the "What if?" question is directly altered. The first one you meet is a technician version of Jan, and he is created by changing that to escape his father's abuse of his mother and himself; instead of running away, he fights back.</p>
<p>You'll need these alternate Jans to progress through the story because they have the skills to fix something that's broken, and simply because in the actual gameplay, they will need to man different parts of your base. It raised the question of whether you have some control over which Jan you get and when, which I asked, but with this being a narrative-focused title, you will create the Jan needed. This did worry me at first, but getting to see what's on offer did alleviate that.</p>
<p>When you create Jan Technician, sadly not called Jan Hammer, he is understandably disoriented and angry. He was created because you needed him to fix something, nothing more, and he's now facing the near-inescapable death you're facing. He didn't ask for this, but it also opens up the opportunity to win him and the other Jans over through the discussions you have, your shared memories, and, at times, what your alternate version did differently. It's a compelling scenario and one that 11 bit studios seems to be handling well, though, after the use of emotions in This War of Mine, I'm not surprised.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>But what of the gameplay outside of your conversations? Here's where The Alters surprised me more than anywhere else. I expect a good narrative and emotional impact from the developers now. Still, I didn't expect what could be a successful gelling of adventure, survival, and side-on base building (think Fallout Shelter). 11 bit studios has managed to do this quite successfully; at least, that's what I get from the first few hours of the game.</p>
<p>The opening doesn't start quickly, and it is arguably the only thing I think could put people off. The first hour, maybe an hour and a half, is all introductions. It sets the scene, introducing Jan and the giant wheel that is your base. I didn't mind it, but it was the issue I heard from others at the hands-on event, and I can understand that, particularly as - in the current climate - the first few hours need to hook you to keep people going past the steam refund period.</p>
<p>Since these were the first few hours, I didn't get to see all the rooms you get to build in your base, but what I did see started to expand quite quickly. You'll also research expansions, manufacture tools, meals, and more. This is where the multiple versions of you come in, where you can task them with different base rooms, each with their strengths. You'll even be able to send them out into the world to mine, but be careful to keep an eye on their radiation levels and overall health - physical and mental.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Alters Preview - Resource Management On A Smaller Scale]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-preview-resource-management-on-a-smaller-scale.880428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I had a chance to fly out to Poland to get hands-on time with 11Bit Studios' upcoming title, <em>The Alters. The Alters</em> is a resource management game where players take on the role of Jan Dolski, an astronaut stranded on a planet trying to collect resources, build up his base, and continue along the planet's surface trying to outrun the harsh sunrise.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Immediately Sinks Its Hooks Into You</h2>

<p>Our demo began with the start of the game, here Jan had crashlanded on the planet and found that he was the sole survivor of his crew. Making his way to the mobile operations base he had shelter but quickly learned that he would need to gather resources from the surface to begin to repair the base.</p>

<p>Jan was able to contact those in charge of monitoring the mission, to questionable success, and learn that he could get rescued but he'd first need to make it somewhere safe and far from the ever-encroaching sunlight of dawn that would fry the ship and him inside it.</p>



<p>Understanding that piloting this ship and making it to safety isn't entirely within his skillset Jan is given access to the full power of the Quantum Computer on board and The Womb. Combined the Computer is able to create alternate timelines of Jan, where certain decisions were made differently, resulting in different professions.</p>

<p>Some Jans that I got to see in our time playing included a Technician, Miner, Scientist, and I had just created a Botanist Jan before being told I had reached the limit of the presentation.</p>

<p>There's not much more to say but that <em>The Alters</em> had an incredibly strong opening. There was immediate tension in Jan's predicament, a solid plot hook and objective, and also the lingering question of "how do we survive this?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=1hMpPV6X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=MTCaMUzI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spend downtime in your base before braving the outside world</figcaption></figure><h2>Gameplay Mechanics Never At Odds</h2>

<p>For me coming to this event, <em>The Alters</em> was a bit of an unknown quantity, I had remembered seeing its announcement at the PC Gaming Show but the gameplay was a bit all over the place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It showed off <em>Fallout Shelter</em>-like base building, the resource management and survival of <em>Frostpunk</em>, but also third-person exploration and resource gathering that may be more familiar to casual fans of survival games. Playing the game it felt like it all worked together perfectly harmoniously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=EjgYBS7W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=zmRcts88 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Obtain resources to build more and survive in The Alters</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay began by being very hands-on with what the player should be doing, I can imagine for some it was annoying having their hand held but I enjoyed the blend of story and gameplay as you learned that you needed certain resources to build a structure that could obtain a different resource. With so much going on narratively it never felt like I was simply following a tutorial.</p>

<p>There was no point where the game made me feel lost, and as the narrative was introducing concepts like the Quantum Computer, the story of Jan's life, and the ability to create Alters the pace still felt rapid and kept me engaged.</p>

<p>Within 40 minutes I already had an Alter or two, had learned a bit more about them, and was assigning them to help gather resources from the planet's surface.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=MVioeUnP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=dbs5tkHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can assign your Alters to take on different tasks that will help around the base or out in the world</figcaption></figure><p>It felt like pushing dominoes that a resource would let me gather another, which would lead to new structures, I'd create a new Alter, build a new part of the ship for them, and then we'd move on to gather more resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the harsh pacing of <em>Frostpunk </em>where a dozen things are happening all at once and it's up to you to somehow balance them all everything in <em>The Alters</em> is very deliberate and smaller in scale. You'll always take steps because you know what you want to do next, and never because you're just reacting to the world.</p>

<h2>Interact With Your Alters, And Your Alters Interact With You</h2>

<p>While there wasn't too much time to interact with the Alters what time we did have laid some good groundwork for where the mechanic would lead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=uC2NiJY7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=EciqhG7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jan will remember that</figcaption></figure><p>As soon as you awaken a new Alter you'll see different emotions appearing around their head as they're angry or apprehensive. It's not just enough to manage resources you also need to manage your relationships with the versions of yourself that you might have been</p>

<p>An early example of interaction with my Technician Alter was after learning they were sleeping on the floor at night I was able to craft a dormitory that could house up to four Alters. Looking down the research tech tree I noticed there was also space to create private rooms that could improve moods further.</p>

<p>I was also able to bond with an Alter by gifting them a pocket multi-tool that both he and I had fond memories of. It goes to show how exploration might reward the player with resources, but can also provide you with chances to strengthen your bond with other Alters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=028s2_Xm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=2KRyYe-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Different conversations will open up giving you a chance to improve relationships or create new structures</figcaption></figure><p>One very unnerving conversation with an Alter came from the birth of the Miner variant of Jan. The memories that led to this Jan's current predicament also included him losing his arm in an accident. Awakening with both of his hands was a rattling experience.</p>

<p>As I was pondering what something like this could mean Alex Jordan, the Voice Actor behind Jan and his different Alters, happened to walk by and tease that where these memories come from will be explored as the game continues.</p>

<h2>The Look Of A New World</h2>

<p>One of the things that most impressed me was the visuals and sound design of <em>The Alters</em>. From the moment you crash down on the planet, you're met with known quantities like rain and lightning, as well as the alien elements like the oil slick look of the waves or strange ferrofluid reactions to the sand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=w9Y9eCyR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=BIzlWdtz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you approach Rapidium the ground begins to shake as if altered by digital noise</figcaption></figure><p>It was tense dealing with how little you could be outside your ship during each active day while also marveling at the world that was around you.</p>

<p>Within the ship, it was a bit more of the standard sci-fi fare in the look and feel of the place. The internal environment gave a vibe of a cleaner and slightly more up-to-date aesthetic that you'd see in 90s sci-fi like the Alien franchise.</p>

<p>It was impressive to see how much work had been done on each of the Alters. While some only offered slight differences where were others that held themselves in different ways that you could tell came from a different life.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Might Be A Gateway To <em>Frostpunk</em></h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The Alters</em> as someone who enjoys a moderate amount of resource balancing and gets stuck into a good story.</p>

<p>The DNA of <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>This War of Mine</em> is very present but it feels like <em>The Alters</em> is being set up as a more casual entry into the rest of what 11Bit has to offer. If those elements tickle your fancy then 11Bit already has the next game for you to try.</p>

<p>After getting only a few hours on the game I was left wanting more, I want to know how much deeper the mechanics go as well as what's going on with the mysterious corporation behind Project Dolly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161457/hellblade-2-psychosis-psychologist-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0dNaXI">Ninja Theory’s 2017 game <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em> is famous for exploring the experiences of people with psychosis through the medium of a vision quest undertaken by Senua, a Celtic warrior in the early Middle Ages. It earned acclaim for its sensitive, thoroughly researched, and audio-visually immersive portrayal of Senua’s condition — something the Ninja Theory team had arrived at through close collaboration with Paul Fletcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p id="F3XVew">Following a singular success like this is always challenging, but maybe especially so in the case of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a>, which was released this week on Windows PC and Xbox Series X, and is included with Game Pass. How could Ninja Theory bring players back into Senua’s experience of the world without rehashing the first game — or sidelining or trivializing her condition? How could it raise the stakes for the character without undoing Senua’s growth, or succumbing to the “descent into madness” tropes the first game had so conscientiously avoided?</p>
<p id="F1qXm6">The answer, as it turns out, was quite simple: Have her meet and interact with other people.</p>
<div id="OLaFCV"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVBxvlRV0d4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SwyFJC">“We definitely didn’t want to walk back on [the first game] and make it seem as though we’re resetting her,” scriptwriter and Performance Capture Director Lara Derham said during a conversation with myself and Fletcher at Ninja Theory’s Cambridge offices, which Polygon visited a couple months before the game’s launch. </p>
<p id="VZorVS">“She’s still got that sense of a greater sense of peace, a greater sense of opportunity,” Derham said. “But I see the first game as a very internal journey, very personal, and very oriented around herself and what she’s lost. And I think this game, while we’re still obviously seeing the world through Senua’s eyes, it’s more about interacting with the world around her, people around her, and pushing out into the future a little more.”</p>
<p id="MQtWUC">This makes sense dramatically, but for Fletcher it was also an opportunity to get deeper into a crucial aspect of psychosis that the first game, by nature, hadn’t really explored. </p>
<p id="bT7MXX">“I think what Lara and the team are doing now is exploring a bit of the distress of psychosis that perhaps wasn’t so much to the fore in <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, which is what happens when your reality — your construct of reality — conflicts or coincides with that of other people around you,” Fletcher said. </p>
<p id="7ymOR6">One of the most prominent aspects of psychosis for some people is the constant narration of internal voices, characterized in the game as Furies. As Senua interacts with other people on her quest to track down some slavers in Iceland, a natural dramatic tension arises from the way the Furies react during conversations — sometimes encouraging her to interact, sometimes sowing seeds of distrust.</p>

<p id="AgXauG">Fletcher explains that this tension gets at one of the most fascinating aspects of psychosis — one that can be illuminating about the human condition in general, in fact. </p>
<p id="aII4jh">“I think one of the first things [about being human] is that we make contact with each other through a sort of tacit agreement about the fact that we’re inhabiting the same space with the same experiences and same reality,” he said. “Whereas in fact, we’re all carrying our own little environments around with us — and I think, in psychosis, that that rupture is much greater.”</p>
<p id="JXEEIO">For people with psychosis, interacting with other people means bridging the gap between two (or more) quite different realities, which can be a huge challenge. “That kind of split focus between this internal world and the external world can be really difficult to manage,” Derham said. </p>
<p id="MDfbIl">Fletcher agreed: “It’s a very exhausting process to juggle it for people, you know. If somebody still has these psychosis-related beliefs, but they’re also engaging with people who don’t share them at all — and, in fact, think that they’re mad — then there’s all sorts of things that they have to do to suppress them or to hide them. And they also have to somehow negotiate between the two — to find a way of having this cherished inner reality that they don’t let go of, while at the same time functioning within a different one.”</p>
<p id="sbOdMm">That Senua might “cherish” her own experience of reality is one of the key learnings Derham and Fletcher took from the conversations they had with people with psychosis while they were researching for the game. </p>
<p id="LQP3Hv">“The experiences, or voices and visions, [are] actually integral to the sense of self,” Fletcher said. “It’s not a symptom that’s just been stuck on to a person. People will often say: ‘This is a part of me. It’s my reality, it’s my experience, and you can’t just treat it as a... it’s not a tumor.’ Sometimes the experiences are deeply rewarding and engaging, immersive, pleasurable; they’re not always suffering.”</p>

<p id="53bNda">“Obviously, a lot of what Senua experiences is quite dark,” Derham said. “But occasionally, there’ll be moments where she feels a special connection with someone or the world seems to have a special kind of beauty to her. And I think those experiences are very positive. And that reflects what we’ve understood from people we’ve talked to — that occasionally, there’ll be a time where the world just seems a bit brighter than it might to some of the rest of us.”</p>
<p id="C6ZoTD">Researching psychosis for the Hellblade games from a purely experiential perspective, rather than as a problem to be solved or as suffering to be alleviated, also challenged Fletcher’s medical and academic perspectives on the condition. “The sole question here, or the starting question here, was always, ‘What’s it like? What does that feel like?’ And I think it created a whole new conversation for me with people with a history of psychiatric illness, which is very enriching,” he said.</p>
<p id="zs8gKf">After <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em> came out, Fletcher remembers feeling encouraged by what he saw as a successful effort to destigmatize psychosis and mental health issues at large. That’s still a hope he nurtures for <em>Senua’s Saga</em>, of course, but now he harbors an even bigger ambition: that the game can encourage every player to consider a big metaphysical question. Perhaps the biggest. </p>
<p id="b0ERXk">“The fantasy I have is that people will reflect upon the nature of their constructions of reality,” he said, “and just how tenuous our links with objective reality might be.” </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793902842681638976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, reliable leaker @HYPEX revealed potential Lethal Company-themed cosmetics that are possibly coming to Fortnite.</p>



<p>HYPEX did not have further details about the release date for this collaboration. However, they did showcase both a Lethal Company skin and Back Bling.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company was a co-op horror indie hit about collecting scrap together on abandoned moons, a welcome surprise for Fortnite. </p>



<p>HYPEX has successfully leaked a variety of information about Fortnite for a long time. That includes details about the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-star-wars-crossover-announced-for-may-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars crossover</a> and more.</p>



<p>Another prominent Fortnite leaker, user @ShiinaBR, also showcased an upcoming “Company Jig” emote for the Lethal Company crossover. This included a brief video of the emote in action <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1793916082321039698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company launched into Early Access in October 2023 to rave reviews, praised for its atmosphere and more. It still maintains Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam. </p>



<p>In fact, Lethal Company further seemed to influence games like Content Warning, which similarly took the indie scene by storm last April. At this time, there’s still no date for Lethal Company’s full release. </p>



<p>While Fortnite fans await the Lethal Company crossover, many are hoping for more information about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fallout-crossover-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fallout collaboration</a>. Fans of the IP enjoyed seeing the T-60 Power Armor suits. Fallout certainly earned wider appeal among casual audiences following the Amazon live-action series.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not officially confirmed anything about the Lethal Company collaboration yet.</p>

                <p>The Alters is a strange, genre-blending sci-fi survival game that's centered around cloning its protagonist. After Jan Dolski--a spaceship engineer--crash-lands on a desolate, uncharted planet he must clone himself to survive. It's an odd premise, but it's one that developer 11 Bit Studios tackles earnestly. Cloning Jan is built around a series of "What If?" questions: What if Jan pursued chemistry instead of engineering, or what if he stood up to his abusive father? These "What If?" questions are at the heart of The Alter's themes and narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo begins as Jan crash-lands on a black sand beach with jagged cliffs and rough water. The Alters has a strong visual identity, with the almost-monochrome world punctuated by bright and colorful flares lighting up the sky as rain pours down. The world looks beautiful, ferocious, and alien all at once. As Jan makes his way to the Mobile Base--a giant wheel-like structure--he learns that his whole crew, including the captain, died on impact. He's alone and very, very far from home.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Alters Is An Ambitious Genre Blending Survival Game</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Upon reaching the Mobile Base, Jan learns that he must relocate the base before sunrise, otherwise the sunlight will fry everything it touches. In order to get it up and running, Jan needs natural resources and a technician. And to accrue the necessary resources, Jan must set up mining outposts on top of mineral deposits in the surrounding area. The materials can then be transported to the Mobile Base by daisy-chaining pylons together. It's a rather straightforward process with just enough quirks and intricacies to keep it engaging. However, recruiting a technician is a bit tougher considering Jan is on the planet all by himself. This is where cloning comes in.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you clone Jan, you are presented with a timeline of his life, and you can create branches at key moments that result in different Jans with different personalities and skill sets. As you create more Jans, more game systems open up and your odds of survival increase. However, cloning Jan comes with its own set of repercussions that 11 Bit Studios seems eager to explore. The first alternate Jan you create is a technician, and when he finds out he's a clone living in a universe where his childhood did not exist, he's understandably frustrated and confused.</p><p dir="ltr">Jan's decision to clone himself doesn't come easily, either. The logistical and ethical implications weigh heavily on him, but one person can't run the Mobile Base alone. Due to the urgency of the situation and pressure from the unsavory organization that funded the expedition, he suspends his moral dilemma and clones himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backed by some light social-sim mechanics and dialogue options, proto-Jan must earn technician-Jan's trust by spending time and bonding with him. Chatting with Jan's alter is surprisingly novel. Sure, they are biologically the same person, but because technician-Jan chose a different path than proto-Jan, it's fascinating to see how their parallel lives have impacted who they are and how they navigate the world. The Alters, based on my two-hour preview, seems like the perfect setup to explore its themes of individualism and identity, and the complicated relationship of nature vs. nurture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to game director Tomasz Kisilewicz, "Learning and understanding their storylines while managing them effectively is at the core of…the game." While not every Jan will be as frustrated as technician-Jan, many of them will have their own flaws and insecurities that proto-Jan must navigate. Sometimes that’s through dialogue and other times it’s by creating a Jan that can compliment or uplift another. It's tough to say how deep these social-sim mechanics go, but considering how many genres 11 Bit Studios is balancing, a bit of restraint might go a long way. Too much sim management might muddle the experience, and too little might make it feel superfluous. After all, The Alters is a survival game first and foremost, and most of my time was spent outside of my ship, exploring the planet.</p><blockquote><p>It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Like many survival games, much of your time is spent harvesting materials, building structures, and researching new technologies. However, The Alters' survival mechanics aren't as freeform as something you might see in Grounded or Valheim. The Mobile Base--at least in the first few hours--only moves for plot reasons. This means that players will likely experience the world in a similar manner: Explore the same areas, mine the same resources, and inhabit the same sections of the map. While this may turn some survival fans off, this linearity feels intentional. It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative. Unlike other survival games, The Alters seems to have a definitive ending with clear goalposts: Build up the Mobile Base enough in order to fly back home.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, the gameplay diversity lies in its management-sim mechanics. After you unlock the technician, a handful of different alters become available, and as long as you have the resources you can create whichever Jan you think is most helpful. From there, you can choose which technologies you'd like to prioritize, which alter is working on what, and how you'd like to arrange and upgrade your ship and its various modules. As you create more alters, you'll need to build more facilities to appease the growing demand. Eventually, your ship could become a small self-sufficient colony populated by Jans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I asked Kisilewicz about how 11 Bit Studios balances and blends all these disparate genres, he said, "We wanted to find the tools and elements of different genres that would suit the message…Combining them together was a big challenge, but also something exciting. If we can make these work together it’s going to be something else. Something different." In order for the player to feel like they are exploring an uncharted planet with a crew of clones, the gameplay needed to support that. That meant social-sim mechanics to give the crew a bit of dynamism, survival elements to make the planet feel dangerous, and management systems to fully utilize the crew.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant. No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. It's hard to say if that "push" will ever come based on my playtime, but after chatting with Kisilewicz, it seems like the team is well aware of their lofty ambitions. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-franchise-nears-500-million-software-sales-in-latest-figures.880404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-franchise-500-million-figures<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has released some new figures for the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise, showing just how popular and enduring the series' legacy truly is.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/aboutus/figures/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new set of numbers on the company's official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is nearing 500 million software units shipped worldwide, with the latest figure standing at a whopping 480 million.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that around 24 million of those, at last count, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million">can be attributed</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, so the series is still going strong sales-wise despite the ambivalent reaction to those games' technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=F8psW4wr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=b2nvhZXF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Love 'em or hate 'em,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have earned big bucks for The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, a quick glance at Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">best-selling titles list</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sword and Shield&nbsp;</em>have sold around 26 million units, so between them, the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games on the Switch alone make up for more than 10% of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s total software sales.</p>

<p>The Pokemon Company points out that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has been translated into nine languages around the world, too, so it's a truly global franchise (as if you needed reminding).</p>

<p>On the trading card side, the company pulls out some more staggering statistics. Almost 65 billion&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>cards have been manufactured since the game was launched, and the card game is available in 15 different languages across 93 countries.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated TV offerings, meanwhile, have been made available in 192 countries and regions around the world. It's a pretty sobering reminder that it's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s world, and we're all just living in it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=dJFuQDNX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=1-vdDVSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated series offerings are truly global.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise is done conquering the world, so these numbers are likely to get even more impressive over time.</p>

<p>While a mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game hasn't been announced for this year,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced">lined up for a release on Switch in early 2025</a>, and a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Trading Card Game&nbsp;</em>mobile app is scheduled to arrive this year.</p>

        <p>As companies start to rebuild the development capacity lost in mass layoffs and closures, much of the focus will be on growing new studios away from traditional high-cost regions</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The enormous wave of layoffs, studio closures, and corporate consolidations which hit the games industry last year is by no means over – but it does appear to have crested, at least, with the pace of such announcements starting to slow down as we've entered the second quarter of this 2024.</p>
<p>The knife will still fall in some painful places before this is over, but at last we're also starting to see early signs of recovery – green shoots amidst the rubble, with new studios being formed and some established ones cautiously starting to expand again.</p>
<p>The scale of the downturn this time around was unprecedented – not least because the industry overall is so much larger than in previous cycles, so there are more jobs to be lost in the first place – but the downturn itself was a familiar story. Companies over-extended in an economic environment where capital was easy to come by and made some bad bets on trends that didn't turn out to have the appeal or longevity they hoped; a shift in economic climate then dampened risk appetite and companies that had voraciously pursued growth for years suddenly found themselves obsessed with cost-cutting instead. This cycle has repeated throughout the industry's history at various intervals and at different scales.</p>
<p>It is a cycle, though, and the wheel that turns downwards eventually reaches its nadir and begins to move upwards again. It's a little too early to proclaim that we've bottomed out, but at some point fairly soon the industry will start the process of rebuilding the capacity it has just lost; hiring will outpace redundancies, and studio openings will become more commonplace than studio closures.</p>
<p>The big question, then, isn't whether the jobs that went away will come back – they will – but where and in what form they'll come back. The capacity the industry will rebuild will have a different focus and form to the capacity it tore down over the past year and a half. Crucially, it may also have a different location.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated"</p></blockquote>
<p>To that last point, keep an eye on the trickle of announcements of new studio openings and expansions that we've started to see coming through. Just this week, Amazon announced that it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-opens-new-studio-in-bucharest">opening a new studio in Bucharest</a>. Larian, high off the extraordinary success of Baldur's Gate 3, is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-to-expand-with-warsaw-office">opening one in Warsaw</a>.</p>
<p>The depth of game development talent in Eastern Europe is unquestionable – the era when game companies in that region were almost exclusively working as outsourcing houses for major studios in North America or Western Europe is long gone – but it's also undeniable that the cost of operating a studio in those regions is much cheaper than in traditional game development heartlands like the West Coast of America or the South of England.</p>
<p>As the industry begins to rebuild its lost capacity, that cost calculation is going to be a tough one to avoid. At the same time that the games business was carrying out mass layoffs and closures, inflation in high cost of living areas was running at its highest level in a generation, and salaries in those areas have gone up significantly in response.</p>
<p>Game development is incredibly labour intensive, requiring a lot of people with a wide range of advanced technical and creative skills; the cost of labour is one of the most defining aspects of the overall cost of creating a game. If you can successfully operate a studio somewhere like Eastern Europe or South-East Asia rather than in Los Angeles or London, you can bring down development costs significantly – at least in theory.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/warsaw.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Larian Studios opened a new studio in the Polish capital of Warsaw this week</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That cost gap has always existed, of course, and publishers have been experimenting with opening studios in less expensive regions for decades – but in the current climate, the calculus has shifted quite resoundingly in that direction.</p>
<p>That's not just because costs in expensive regions have soared, far outpacing wage growth in less expensive regions; it's also because the skilled labour base with the technical and artistic skills required to build games has improved significantly in many cheaper regions. In many places, especially in Eastern Europe, there's also now a base of skilled workers with significant game development experience, which was always the key thing that was lacking in these regions in the past; there were tons of skilled young people but few who had the kind of experience of development that's required to ensure that projects run smoothly, and relatively easy to find in workforces in those traditional game development heartlands.</p>
<p>The conclusion a lot of companies are going to reach is the same; when the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated.</p>
<p>However, the question of whether that new capacity will really be able to get up to speed quickly and effectively remains a thorny one. There are certainly more experienced staff in these regions than in the past, but there's still a major gap – and that's problematic when you're trying to maximise the efficiency of your new development resources.</p>
<p>The advantage of experienced staff is that they've made mistakes, and watched others make mistakes, and know how to avoid those mistakes in future; that's experience in a nutshell, and a studio lacking that experience will probably make a ton of costly, time-consuming mistakes that could have been avoided otherwise.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the staff available in less costly regions, while very highly skilled, are skilled in ways that may look similar on paper to what staff in an established developer would be like, but are very different in practice. For example, there is a new wealth of game development talent in India, but it's almost exclusively focused on mobile game development, and even at that tends to be focused on creating games for lower-spec devices – a valuable and worthwhile skillset, but not one that's easily parlayed into developing for high-end consoles or PCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The games industry will build up capacity again in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that will be in cheaper locations"</p></blockquote>
<p>What has tended to happen in the past is that companies establish studios in cheaper regions using less experienced staff, while the experienced staff in more expensive regions find funding and establish their own independent studios; ultimately, many of the studios in cheaper regions simply end up functioning as outsourcing providers for those experienced developers, who have been bought up by publishers on the upturn of the cycle. It's generally been a fairly wasteful way to reach a straightforward outcome – but there's a growing sense that things could be different this time, as regions like Eastern Europe and (for mobile titles at least) South and South-East Asia now have some homegrown experienced talent available.</p>
<p>What's more, rising living standards in many of those places – combined with many people in expensive regions in the West feeling increasingly priced out of a decent standard of living – could make it appealing for experienced developers from western countries to move there and work for these new studios. That's something that has tended to be very rare in the past, with developers generally only moving to such studios when they were taking on senior management roles, but the push and pull factors for people who have been working in extremely high cost-of-living areas are markedly different this time around, and a kind of "reverse brain drain" is arguably on the cards, especially for younger and more mobile staff.</p>
<p>In the short- to mid-term, at least, the outcome is clear; the games industry is going to start to seriously build up capacity again at some point in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that capacity is going to be located in cheaper locations than previously.</p>
<p>What's less clear this time around is what the fate of those new studios in cheaper regions will be; more than any point in the past, there's reason to believe that they could thrive and even start to attract experienced talent from other regions.</p>
<p>For those affected by the industry layoffs, however, this just introduces another thorny issue to grapple with; as hiring begins to ramp back up in earnest, many people may have to face tough questions about their willingness to move to lower-cost regions to continue their careers.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead's chaotic alien-shooter Helldivers 2 became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, player numbers have since declined.</p>
<p>A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3m">SteamDB</a>, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 30 days is 166,305. That's a drop of 64 percent.</p>
<p>Looking by average players, February had 208,303 helldivers in the game. That average player count has dropped to 78,634 over the last 30 days (a 62 percent drop).</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, player numbers are expected to drop over time. But for Helldivers 2 there are a number of factors that may have contributed to this decline.</p>
<p>The most notable reason is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this month</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony soon backtracked on its plans</a>, stating it was "still learning what is best for PC players", calling the monumental spate of feedback "invaluable".</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the game's decline in player numbers could be the balancing, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-gets-new-ceo-plans-to-remain-an-independent-studio">Arrowhead's newly appointed chief creative officer and chairman Johan Pilestedt</a> previously admitted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">team sometimes went too far with</a>. Additionally, the game has sometimes been subject to bugs and other issues, causing player frustration.</p>
<p>In response, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-mulling-slightly-lower-update-frequency-after-hectic-first-few-months">Helldivers 2 team is now considering a "slightly lower" but higher standard update frequency</a> after a busy first few months.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While there has undeniably been a drop in player numbers, Helldivers 2 remains popular, and Pilestedt believes the game's success is not because of the price point (Helldivers 2 currently retails at a comparatively modest £34.99 on Steam).</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Pilestedt spoke at the Nordic Game conference, where he addressed Helldivers 2's 'smash hit' status. Here, he stated Arrowhead managed to get the "fundamentals" right and delivered on the "fantasy" of the experience. While many others have made shooters like Helldivers 2 before, Pilestedt said his team "dug into the believability of what it would be to be in that game". </p>
<p>Pilestedt also reasoned Helldivers 2 is an authentic experience in a lot of ways and doesn't put up barriers that wouldn't be actually there. "In Star Wars, how many strikes does it take to cut somebody's hand off with a lightsaber? It's one," he said. "It is fundamental that we adhere to the fantasy... Fine, balance it, but don't make it two strikes. I know that's false, and now we're not making a Star Wars game anymore." </p>
<p>
Another factor that has contributed to Helldivers 2's success is its style, with the developer stating the game is a "representation of those who made it". </p>
<p>Pilestedt lastly touched on its success as a live service game, something others have struggled with. "It's easy to say, 'well, we'll earn more money by being able to drop a content pack here and there'. But that's not a reason why any consumer would want to engage with us," he noted. </p>
<p>Pilestedt said live service games can be good for the industry "if done right", as they become a continuously evolving hobby. "If you forget this when making a live service game, then I think that - I don't want to say it's a problem - but it is a problem. I think that is a problem... I've decided it's a problem, it's a massive problem," he said.</p>
<p>He also implored developers not to shy away from engaging with its community. While he admitted there are "arseholes" out there, that should not prevent a studio from interacting with its fanbase. He noted there will be times when people get "pissed", acknowledging that PSN hoo-ha. "But, at that point, it's like 'ah, sorry! Yeah, that was a bad move by us'... an apology doesn't mean that you devalue your own brand as an organisation, it just strengthens you."</p>
<p>You can hear Pilestedt talk in the video below, starting at the 4hr 37 minute mark.</p>

IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p>Now, a month after release, the new update adds the Boss Challenge mode, which pits players against the 19 bosses from the base game. Progression in the Boss Challenge requires battle data from bosses you’ve previously defeated, director Kim Hyung Tae explained in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/23/stellar-blade-adds-new-boss-challenge-mode-on-may-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>. You can also fight bosses on the hard difficulty setting after you’ve seen the ending of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb1-1716548636019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>To start the challenge, you can either load up and use your own gear you’ve been using or choose one of several presets. “Choose the minimum preset for a true challenge, which is extremely understated, or the maximum preset, which has all of your skills and stats buffed up, if you want to taunt the boss with some spectacular combat,” Kim Hyung Tae suggested.</p><p>After the challenge is over, your battle data is automatically analyzed. You’ll see metrics like battle time, number of perfect parries and dodges, consumable usage, and more. You can compare your results with those of your friends. If you defeat all bosses in the Boss Challenge on Normal difficulty setting or higher, you’ll get to earn the Neurolink Suit for Eve, below.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb3-1716548657498.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of new outfits, the update adds two new Nano Suits: White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi (check them out in the images below). Kim Hyung Tae encouraged players check in-game for more Nano Suits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb4-1716548674770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb5-1716548689495.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>And finally, quality-of-life improvements mean if you switch to ranged attack mode and switch back while locked on to an enemy, you will automatically lock on to the enemy again. The update also adds an option to always show the compass in the HUD.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
