		<p>Activision has released a slick cinematic reveal trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Zombies game mode, with a gameplay reveal scheduled for later this week on 8th August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Zombies Terminus Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z0Ni2JIqzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Setting up the story for Terminus, one of the launch maps in Black Ops 6 Zombies, it reintroduces us to a bunch of Requiem team members, who are being held prisoner in a mysterious military facility in the Philippine Sea. They’re broken out of prison by a woman named Maya – convinced to do this job while looking for her brother – before Strauss makes a return and just about convinces them that they should go after their common enemy, Richtofen.</p>
<p>An in-depth reveal of the actual gameplay will come on Thursday, 8th August at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST.</p>
<p>Activision promises “extensive comms direct from the <a title="Companies > Treyarch [304 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/activision-blizzard/activision/treyarch/">Treyarch</a> Zombies Team, including an in-depth gameplay overview, information about your pre-match preparation options, full details on Round-Based Zombies gameplay, and a bestiary of the undead.”</p>

<p>If Zombies aren’t your thing, then it might be the other parts of Black Ops 6 that tickle your fancy. The Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta will take play at the end of August and in early September, with two weeks of play for all who pre-order the game across PlayStation, Xbox and PC, as well as for Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/cod-black-ops-6-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">COD: Black Ops 6 is coming out on 25th October</a>, and will remain a cross-generation release across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstaiton-5">PS5</a> and PS4, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and Xbox One, and PC. It will also launch straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, though with the caveat that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">Microsoft is shaking up the subscription service tiers</a> so you’ll need Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass to get day one games.</p>

But after a full day in the game, nobody could find Kirlirger. In fact, players didn’t catch sight of the elusive prey until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EENlX/status/1819416054319534457&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EENlX/status/1819416054319534457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2</a></span>, three days after his release. The S-Rank hunt just spawns on extremely rare weather conditions—there must be a new moon and fog in the area, and new moons occur roughly once every real world day and a half, so waiting for fog to also coincide with that took a few days. So if you are trying to hunt the elusive S-Rank down, just pay attention to the weather.</p><figure id="" data-id="df9c436c9e16d3b28fe86f08baa7b557" data-recommend-id="image://df9c436c9e16d3b28fe86f08baa7b557" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large lizard like creature named Kirlirger the Abhorrent stands in a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="df9c436c9e16d3b28fe86f08baa7b557" data-recommend-id="image://df9c436c9e16d3b28fe86f08baa7b557" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large lizard like creature named Kirlirger the Abhorrent stands in a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before Kirlirger appeared, players were losing their minds trying to find out exactly what the spawn conditions were.

Kirlirger’s bio hinted that he’s a master of sneaking up on his prey despite his large size, a villain who preys upon local merchants trying to transport goods. While people did theorize that fog may have to do with his spawn condition, a lot of other possibilities were also raised. Confused players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NymeiasWard/status/1819282231124545674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NymeiasWard/status/1819282231124545674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tried everything</a></span> they could: running around on alpacas, dressing up as merchants, wearing sunglasses, using certain spells on the spawn point, and more.

But it was still fun as hell to watch everybody come up with the most outside-the-box conditions possible to try and make the elusive S-Rank appear.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While it’s not as deep as the changes coming to gameplay, presentation, and franchise mode, there are still some updates that players will like within the mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-madden-25-superstar-mode-features-and-details">Madden 25 Superstar Mode Features And Details</h2>



<h3 id="h-preset-archetypes">Preset Archetypes</h3>



<p>Different archetypes allow different max ratings.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-customization">Player Customization</h3>



<p>More faces, facial hair, hair styles, and even tattoos are available for your custom player in Madden 25.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-import">Player Import</h3>



<p>Players who have a Road to Glory superstar in College Football 25 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox  Series X|S can  import them over to Madden 25 on current-gen consoles. Those who import from College Football will receive extra creation points.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-nfl-scouting-combine">NFL Scouting Combine</h3>



<p>According to EA Sports, the scouting combine matters more in Madden 25’s Superstar mode. </p>



<p>“Your performance at the Combine will impact your Superstar in many ways,” EA Sports said. “Your Combine performance can boost your player ratings. These boosts aren’t for a game or two – a successful combine could tangibly increase your player’s starting ratings, raising your floor for the rest of your career.”</p>



<h3 id="h-superstar-quests">Superstar Quests</h3>



<p>Once in the NFL, there are new superstar quests that you will have to complete in order to make it as an NFL superstar.</p>



<p>“Your quests are triggered in narrative moments throughout your journey,” says EA Sports. “Maybe your coach pulls you into their office for a 1-on-1 meeting, maybe a teammate wants to let you know they want the ball more. How you respond in these narrative moments will determine which quests open up for your Superstar.”</p>



<h3 id="h-maddencasts">Maddencasts</h3>



<p>Live commentary surrounding your player and storylines.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-grades">Player Grades</h3>



<p>Madden 25 will include a “new suite of actions” that will impact your player grade on the field. One example is receivers receiving a bonus for sticking with their route.</p>



<h3 id="h-teammate-abilities">Teammate Abilities</h3>



<p>Per EA:</p>



<p>“These abilities are earned throughout your journey and passively improve your teammates. You’ll be able to choose when and how you equip these. If you’re playing quarterback – do you want to boost your wide receivers’ Catch In Traffic rating or their Deep Route Running? You’ll be faced with choices all throughout your journey, personalizing every element of the path to stardom.”</p>



<h3 id="h-superstar-showdown">Superstar Showdown</h3>



<p>3v3 games with your custom player with other players online. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-spins-onto-xbox-game-pass-with-august-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a small clutch of games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> in the start of August, and it’s the expected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy</a> that is leading the way.</p>
<p>Crash will arrive later this week on 8th August, but is being preceded by the day one launch of Creatures of Ava, and followed next week by Mafia: Definitive Edition.</p>


<h2>Coming to Game Pass in August</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creatures of Ava</strong> – XSX|S, PC, Cloud – 7th August (Day One)</li>
<li><strong>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</strong> – XSX|S, XBO, PC, Cloud – 8th August</li>
<li><strong>Mafia: Definitive Edition</strong> – XSX|S, XBO, PC, Cloud – 13th August</li>
</ul>
<p>Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy is a fantastic remake of the original PlayStation platformer trilogy, starring the very radical marsupial in Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, all completely remade by Vicarious Visions. It’s the latest game from Activision Blizzard’s library of games that is being drip fed onto Game Pass since the company’s acquisition at the end of last year, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-comes-to-game-pass-july-24th/">COD Modern Warfare 3</a> at the end of last month, and<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/diablo-4-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-march/"> Diablo 4 all the way back in March</a>.</p>
<p>N.Sane Trilogy is fantastic, though, and we said back with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review/">our 2017 review</a> that “As far as remakes go, you can’t get any better than this. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is exactly how fans envisioned it – an unadulterated celebration of a PlayStation pioneer.”</p>


<p>Next week we then have Mafia: Definitive Edition, a similarly ground-up remake by developer Hangar 13, who lifted the original game’s narrative and action and dropped it into their modern engine for Mafia III.</p>
<p>Microsoft are keeping things pretty light in early August, but we can expect a bit more hustle and bustle to Game Pass announcements in the second half of the month, as they look to make a splash at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>There’s some pretty sizeable changes coming to Game Pass in the next few months, as well, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">price hikes and a relaunch of the regular Xbox Game Pass service called Xbox Game Pass Standard</a>. This will now include Xbox online multiplayer, and have the full library of back catalogue games, but will no longer have day one games. This is seemingly a calculated move just to push people to the even higher prices Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">if they want to get Black Ops 6 on day one</a>.</p>

            <p>
A little over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one">confirming</a> a last-gen release for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was in the works, EA has announced the action-adventure sequel will be launching for Xbox One and PS4 on 17th September. Additionally, improvements to the much-maligned PC version are coming.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor initially released for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC last April, picking up its story some five years after the events of 2019's well-recieved Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This time around, Jedi Knight Cal Kestis is still picking a fight with the Empire, but developer Respawn has given him new Force tricks and expanded fight styles to help him through.
</p>
<p>
There's more, of course, but third-person sproinging around the gorgeously rendered Star Wars scenery, hitting baddies with lightsabers remains at its core.

<figcaption>This is how it looked on current-gen systems last year.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmj3ty-Wt48" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wasn't entirely convinced by Jedi: Survivor's "hit-and-miss action" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-hit-and-miss-action-with-the-warmest-of-hearts">reviewed it last year</a>, but he still came away pretty positive about Respawn's sequel. "But - and a big but," he wrote, "I can't emphasise this enough - Star Wars: Jedi Survivor remains fundamentally really fun... It is always enjoyable to ping yourself around runnable walls and ziplines and now grapple hooks (I know) like a human pinball. It is much more desirable that Star Wars games have a little goofiness... Its lack of focus is what holds it back - and also what makes it such a blast."
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will cost £49.99/$49.99 USD and feature "a variety of optimisations aimed at maximizing the hardware capabilities of the consoles" when it launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP0006-CUSA33778_00-APPLEJACKGAME000">PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/star-wars-jedi-survivor-xbox-one/9plrp6phv6xp">Xbox One</a> on 17th September. Pre-orders will receive the Hermit Cosmetic Set (inspired by Obi-Wan Kenobi), Hermit Lightsaber Set, and Combustion Blaster Set.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA says the PC version - which Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsskwVyPoxs">called</a> "the worst PC port of 2023" - will be recieving an update "in the coming weeks". This promises "enhancements to the game's technical performance, controls and more", as well as various quality of life improvements.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 5 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A small change is made to the new STG44 assault rifle, with an increase to the lower-left-arm damage multiplier from 1.2x to 1.3x. The developer says this adjustment is made to make sure the damage dealt to lower arms is now consistent regardless of which arm is hit.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent buff to the Cor-45 pistol's fire rate made the pistol a popular choice for Season 5, but an adjustment is now made to the gun's XRK IP-V2 conversion kit, which the developer says was previously allowing a faster fire rate than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The Zombies part of the update addresses an issue that previously caused the last player to Exfil from a match to be queued into another match before viewing the After Action Report. It also patches an exploit involving safes that would allow players to carry more weapons than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The update is much smaller on the Warzone side, but it does include some impactful weapon balancing.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent addition of the JAK Cataclysm conversion kit made the RPK light machine gun become an overpowered one-shot kill in battle royale. Today's update makes several adjustments to the conversion kit, reducing the damage, damage range, and head modifier to make the gun a three-bullet elimination at the max range, as long as it includes at least one headshot.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite recent nerfs, the Superi 46 submachine was still the most popular close-range option for Warzone. However, the new update looks to decrease the weapon's popularity with a nerf to the gun's damage potential. The near-mid damage is reduced from 29 to 26, and the minimum-damage decreased from 25 to 20.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cor-45 pistol also receives the same adjustment to the gun's XRK IP-V2 conversion kit as mentioned above for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>Season 5 is currently underway with a WWE-themed crossover, but today is the last day to earn free rewards for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-wwe-summerslam-event-all-rewards-and-challenges/2900-5648/">the SummerSlam event</a>, including the WWE operator skin.</p><h3>Global</h3><h3>Customization</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the Lachmann-762 and TAQ-V Battle Rifles from equipping the Bioluminescent Camo.</li><li>Changed the default Finishing Move for the Rhea Ripley Operator to Riptide.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the JAK Burnout Kit from being equipped to the Holger 26 Light Machine Gun.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li>G3T_H1GH  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the Mosquito Drone from targetting enemy players.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li>COD Warrior  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing players to die immediately in the Revive!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is in the news lately, following a report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/style/mrbeast-beast-games-competition-show.html?unlocked_article_code=1._00.Akz3.WPAO-uB2vIIt&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> alleging negative treatment of participants in his upcoming Amazon competition show. This comes on the heels of some other recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-slur-n-word-clip-2017-controversy-explained-1851612313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a>, and, taken together, it’s tempting to see all this as a sign that the MrBeast empire is–maybe at last, depending on your opinions of him–crumbling. But, really, none of this is anything new; instead, it’s the system in which MrBeast operates working as intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Times, contestants on MrBeast’s in-development reality competition show, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104976/amazon-mrbeast-prime-video-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beast Games</em></a>, experienced mistreatment including lack of access to medicine, hygiene supplies, and food (the Times notes that “on a few occasions, the production staff passed around small Feastables chocolate bars, a brand created by Mr. Donaldson, and filmed some people eating and praising the candy.”) Participants also said they experienced sleep deprivation and injuries. In one very reality TV moment, a “bruised and bleeding” contestant who was eliminated claimed she</p><blockquote><p>was handed $1,000 in a stack of dollar bills as a consolation prize but said she had to hand the money back to producers after the cameras were off. Competitors were told they would receive their real payments later, she said, but as of publication time, she had not yet been paid.</p><p>Several contestants told The Times they had since been contacted by the production team and offered an additional $1,000.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Part of the problem seemed to stem from the fact that while participants believed there would only be 1,000 competitors, there were 2,000 in this first round, which will air on MrBeast’s YouTube channel before the second round airs on Amazon. MrBeast has blamed the conditions in part on “the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CrowdStrike incident</a>, extreme weather and other unexpected logistical and communications issues.”</p><p>But these kinds of conditions are endemic to reality TV. In recent years, multiple <em>Love is Blind </em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit/72101776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contestants</a> have <a href="https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1687169404935753733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> Netflix over their treatment on the show. Cast members of the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/10/real-housewives-bravo-reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Real Housewives</em> series</a> have spoken up about their negative experiences. Contestants on <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9786277/is-survivor-show-sexist-women-tv-contestants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Survivor</em></a> experienced discrimination from other cast members. Netflix’s <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> reality show–which draws fundamentally misguided inspiration from Netflix’s scripted <em>Squid Game</em>, which also feels like it inspired <em>Beast Games </em>and, obviously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MrBeast’s <em>Squid Game</em> recreation show</a>–saw contestants allege <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar mistreatment</a> to <em>Beast Games</em> participants.</p><p>A contestant on <em>Squid Game: The Challenge </em>told Rolling Stone, “It was the incompetencies of scale — they bit off more than they could chew.” This sounds similar to what some <em>Beast Games</em> participants who spoke to The Times said of their experiences, with The Times writing that contestants found that the staff members were “often not helpful and appeared disorganized… Contestants felt that the staff was overwhelmed by the volume of competitors.” This is also tragically par for the course in reality TV: staffers across shows have spoken up about <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/reality-tv-workers-unionize-industry-organize-1235746974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overtime, low pay</a>, and other negative working conditions. While there’s no excuse if staffers failed in their duty of care to participants, staff and participants alike are caught in the ugly system of reality TV.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW: Reality TV producers are pulling back the curtain on your favorite shows.</p><p>From World of Dance to American Idol, producers put in 18-hour days with no overtime pay.

These kinds of shows have been vectors to stardom both for rich people like the Kardashians and everyday folks who win competitions like <em>American Idol</em>. But even if they don’t feature actors saying scripted lines, most of us know they aren’t actual reflections of reality. They’re <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnygn/theres-100-manipulation-the-inner-workings-of-reality-tv-according-to-a-producer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">framed and edited</a> to heighten the drama and try to carve out narratives. And competition shows like <em>The Voice, So You Think You Can Dance</em>, and their grittier counterparts like <em>Fear Factor</em>, <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em>, and MrBeast’s <em>Beast Games</em> tell a grim story of how a person finds success these days: either by getting lucky enough to be picked out of a crowd, or putting away all the narrative artifice and simply risking your safety for money.</p><p>MrBeast is the current golden boy of a growing version of reality TV, one that doesn’t take place on TV at all. He’s famous for his acts of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/mr-beast-charity-controversy-1.6846810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largesse</a>, giving money to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_GMakKf7G4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homeless people</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ2ifmkGGus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding surgeries</a>. But he’s not alone: Dramatic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-0lrgoeXiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acts of charity</a> and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ldfGf-FNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pranking it forward</a>” are all over our feeds these days. If I click through more than a couple YouTube Shorts or Facebook Reels, I get mired in an inescapable flood of this kind of stuff, all carefully edited to highlight the gratitude of recipients. On the one hand, videos like these stand in contrast to the nastier stuff on YouTube; as content creator Josh Liljenquist, who films himself buying huge amounts of food for the homeless from local businesses, told <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-tiktok-food-unhoused-homeless-social-media-clout-charity-altruism-facebook-instagram-viral/600336333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota’s Star Tribune</a> about why he started doing his videos,</p><blockquote><p>I was scrolling through a few days ago, and some person was doing public content. He goes behind somebody and just sucker punches him in the back of the head. ... That's the type of stuff that kids are looking at… Would you rather have that, inspiring kids to do that? Or by doing good by feeding homeless people?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>On the one hand, it’s hard to argue with Liljenquist’s logic. If these videos help people while also making acts of charity or kindness appealing, or put copycat ideas in young people’s heads, that’s not a <em>bad</em> thing necessarily. But as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charity-tiktok-videos-put-an-uncomfortable-spin-on-morality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> wrote in 2022, thanks to altruism stunts on platforms like YouTube and TikTok,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We are now so used to viewing the world through our screens that many of us forget to question the fact that a camera is rolling at all… Should vulnerable people have to perform for viewers before they’re deemed worthy of help?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>People have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/02/01/mrbeast-cures-blind-people-video-why-its-receiving-backlash/11161719002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized MrBeast before </a>over these <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/mr-beast-charity-controversy-1.6846810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questions</a>. Plus, if he’s really motivated by doing good, why film it? But at the same time, he wouldn’t be able to do any of this without the money he’s making<em> from</em> filming it. MrBeast’s brand is a unique combination of the illusory down-to-earth parasociality of YouTube and the good vibes of his stunt-based altruism. As Patricia Hernandez described him at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093399/end-of-mrbeast-youtube-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, “His branding is at once self-aggrandizing yet selfless,” doing things for others that are primarily about how <em>he</em> is doing them. This has made him the head of a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/mrbeast-brings-in-700-million-a-yearheres-why-he-says-hes-not-rich.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially lucrative</a> empire and one of the major employers of his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/03/mr-beast-money-hometown-greenville-creator-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hometown</a>.</p><p>But there’s nothing unusual about what he does, both in the world of reality TV and the world of content creation on the internet. And, depressingly, there’s nothing unusual about the dark reality behind these veneers, either. When watching MrBeast and creators like him, it’s easy to be either too cynical or too credulous. But all of this–from the fame he generates to the uncomfortable position recipients of his generosity find themselves in to the chaos behind the scenes–are just an entertainment engine spinning the way it's always spun, and doing just what it's designed to: capture our attention and funnel money to the top, be that TV executives or the MrBeast empire.</p><p>The accusations at <em>Beast Games</em> further bring to light the realities behind competition shows, which badly need an overhaul for the sake of staff and participants alike. And taking some of the shine off MrBeast could serve to put him in context: less a feel-good exemplar of humanity and more, at best, a bandaid on bigger systemic problems like lack of access to medical care, housing, and food. People shouldn’t have to hope to be picked out of the crowd by YouTubers or reality show producers for help. What MrBeast and other creators like him do isn’t some new, feel-good frontier; it’s a symptom of how much our systems have failed us. Even the example of MrBeast’s success reminds me of nothing so much as how bleak the job market is, where maybe it’s better to try to make a living selling pieces of your life and the lives of others on the internet (itself a<a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> harmful grind</a>) than trying to make a decent living by simply <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/blog/illustrating-the-limits-of-homeless-sector-wages-employees-likely-struggle-to-pay-the-rent/#:~:text=A%202021%20study%20by%20Dennis,temporary%20housing%20programs%20was%20%2430%2C189.&amp;text=This%20means%20that%20many%20in,in%20or%20close%20to%20poverty." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working in helping professions</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The grim realities undergirding reality TV is something the original <em>Squid Game </em>explored very well, which is of course why companies like Netflix and Amazon, who benefit from it, completely miss the point in their versions. If the artifice around reality TV has to crack, it should do so around one of its most famous examples. The sooner we see all of this for what it is, and the sooner we do away with it, the better.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/star-wars-jedi-survivor-last-gen-port-hits-ps4-and-xbox-one-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Respawn have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17th September. The last-gen version will come in at a $49.99 retail price, and still have an upgrade path from last-gen to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who pre-orders on PS4 or Xbox One before 17th September will get a free cosmetic item set themed after Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>


<p>In the run up to this new release, Respawn will also be releasing a patch for the PC version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in the coming weeks, which promises “enhancements to the game’s technical performance, controls and more, plus a variety of quality-of-life improvements.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/02/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-being-ported-back-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/">The port was announced almost exactly a year ago</a>, with EA CEO Andrew Wilson confirming that the game was being ported back to the last generation. “Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>That still left plenty of work for Respawn to do, taking everything that the game is able to do on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, using the speedy SSDs for loading and newer versions of Unreal Engine, and making it work with a much lesser CPU and a slower hard drive.</p>

<p>If the port holds up, then this is a great follow up to Respawn’s original Star Wars tale. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review</a>, Aran said, “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a great continuation of Cal Kestis’ journey. The story is a little predictable and platforming could be sharper, but this is a sequel that builds on the ideas of the original and there’s real enjoyment to be had in exploring the expansive new worlds, digging into the lore and running into secret boss fights.”</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don't have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you'll have to, I don't know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>.

<p>To my non-hardware-editor eye, these don’t seem that terrifying, but bear in mind that these are the requirements for running the game at 1080p. I suspect higher resolutions on Ultra are going to take a toll. Best round up a few extra psykers, just to be safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-blinked-and-almost-missed-warhammer-40k-spare-marine-2s-release-date">Space Marine 2 will release on September 9th</a>, and I think it's fair to say we're looking forward to it. To lapse into the accursed lingo of scoring, the 2011 original felt like a 7/10 action game with a 9/10 action game trapped inside it, revving a chainsword. The sequel features <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">a new campaign starring Ultramarine stalwart Lieutenant Titus</a> plus a squishy rogue's gallery of greenskins, Tyranids and Chaos Marines. It also boasts co-op and competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-space-marine-2-will-let-you-go-head-to-head-in-pvp-multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, though sadly it doesn't look like there will be any interspecies PvP.</p>
<p>This latter omission is, of course, a test of your loyalty to the Imperium, the most important "system requirement" of all. A true servant of the God-Emperor would not blanch at being unable to play a Tyranid. Speaking of traitors, a WIP but apparently complete and fully playable version of the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-least-500-people-will-trounce-you-in-space-marine-2s-multiplayer-at-launch-because-theyre-already-playing-a-torrent-of-the-entire-game">leaked online last month</a>. I dare say there's footage in the wilds if you fancy spoiling it for yourself.</p>

The changes don’t deal with the flamethrower directly, but rather with its flame effects and how those are handled by the game’s systems.

While it wasn’t meta breaking, it made the situational tool a lot more useful than it otherwise would have been. After today’s changes, the flames no longer appear to be able to reach the soft underbellies of the Chargers, or easily ignite burn damage on other weak spots. </p><p>It’s also just not as fun to use. “Flamethrower can’t kill chargers now,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the subreddit. “Doesn’t go through their leg armor anymore.

But plenty of players feel like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s an underhanded way</a></span> of potentially pushing them to pay for the new battle passes now that their existing flamethrowers have been nerfed.<br></p><p>Changes like these have long been a sore spot in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, however. While Arrowhead has re-balanced the game at various points to try and keep it challenging and make players explore alternate ways of playing, it can also feel like the studio is just constantly taking away fans’ favorite toys. Players discover a weapon is really good at a thing, they use it religiously for months, it becomes a corner stone of the community culture, and then it gets killed in a new update. For some that keeps the game evolving, but for others it’s a reason to take a break. </p><p>“I’m Level 140, played since launch. I had it with the nerfs man. At least make it make sense!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one particularly demoralized fan. “I thought the people complaining were crazy, but I was here a long time and I see the patterns now: Nerf a weapon, forcing everyone to the new meta. AH sees the meta, nerf it, make the enemy ridiculously 10 times stronger.”</p><p>Not everyone is against the nerf. Some players have already discovered new ways to use the flamethrower that still make it an effective bug-killing machine, but it requires much better positioning and execution. One theory is that the new behavior will more closely mimic the way the new fire-based weapons act, keeping them all in line with one another. Still, it’s easy to see why players who have been casually enjoying the game as it is are getting burnt out on the constant whiplash of weapon balancing. We’ll have to wait until the new Warbond drops later this week to see how it all shakes out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Getting ready to film your next YouTube or TikTok video, but want to find the best and most optimal settings for recording in OBS? While the quality of your video can largely depend on the PC you are filming on, there are still settings in OBS for recording that most would consider the best.</p>



<p>Here are the best OBS settings for recording.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-recording-format">Best OBS Recording Format </h2>



<p>Luckily, recording on OBS is quite simple. Though, there are a few settings you may want to tweak before hitting the record button.</p>



<p>To find your recording settings, simply click Output in the General Settings tab. This will give you options for recording and live streaming. Obviously, we want to focus on recording.</p>







<h3>Best OBS Recording Settings:</h3>



<ul>

<h2>Best OBS Settings For Recording Low-End PC</h2>
