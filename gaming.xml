			<p>Although the excellent Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the first taste of a JRPG not developed by a Japanese studio for many, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is hardly the first JRPG developed by a French team. Years ago, Midgar Studio released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-eternity/">Edge of Eternity</a>, a solid open-world JRPG inspired by series like Final Fantasy and Xenogears, combining a vast world with a strategic turn-based combat system that made the experience rather remarkable, even with some of its issues. Years after work on the game has been completed, Midgar Studio is set to continue their franchise with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-memories/">Edge of Memories</a>, a very different game than its predecessor but one that fans of certain types of action role-playing games will want to keep their eyes on.</p>



<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to briefly try out the game while speaking with Jérémy Zeler-Maury, Midgar Studio founder and CEO, who showed the same passion he did when I met him back in 2016 for an early look at Edge of Eternity. As soon as I picked up the controller to explore a world ravaged by a mysterious plague known as the Corrosion in the role of the Soul Whisperer Eline, I couldn't help but notice the extreme similarities the game developed by Midgar Studio has with last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/">Visions of Mana</a>. According to the Midgar Studio CEO, I wasn't the only one to do so, as, when Square Enix revealed the new entry in the Mana series, many told him they thought it was Edge of Memories that had been revealed. While these similarities are inevitably going to impact the game's reception, and wrongly, as Edge of Memories has been in development long before Visions of Mana got announced, the uncertain future of the Square Enix series could definitely benefit the game, as, aside from a similar, colorful art direction, the Midgar Studio title definitely seems more involving, especially in combat.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Edge of Memories looks a lot like Visions of Mana, but don't let appearances deceive you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While my time with Edge of Memories was short, the demo did an excellent job highlighting some exploration and traversal mechanics, which require players to use the proper elemental powers to open up the way, and some light platforming segments that often take advantage of these mechanics. What was really striking besides the implementation of these mechanics was the nice sense of scale the world, and the fact that I was able to get to any location which looked interesting enough from a distance, although, given the short time and the focused demo, this may not be a thing in the final release.</p>



<p>It's in the combat mechanics, however, that Edge of Memories sets itself apart more from Visions of Mana. Fighting enemies in the Midgar Studio game is considerably more involving, with multiple combo strings, skills sets that can be switched on the fly, and a general more action-oriented feel which aims to recreate the feel of NieR Automata, as Jeremy pointed out as I was trying to take down a boss with multiple targets launching area of effect attacks whose range was highlighted by red circles on the ground, in the vein of modern Mana series games. Not having had a lot of time to delve into these systems, I cannot say if Edge of Memories will feature the same combo freedom as the PlatinumGames-developed title, but controlling Eline felt smooth enough to make combat enjoyable even with minimal knowledge of the game's intricacies.</p>



<p>With Nacon publishing the game after acquiring Midgar Studio in 2022, Edge of Memories won't have to go through an Early Access period when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. I hope the game will launch sooner rather than later, as I am excited to see what else it will have to offer, and if it will be as good as the short Gamescom demo suggested.</p>

              <p>Nintendo’s war against modders and ROM distributors has seen some brutal takedowns over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">dishing out extraordinary punishments</a> against those who make it possible for people to pirate Nintendo games. The latest to fall foul of the Japanese behemoth is Ryan Daly, who for the longest time looked like he was attempting an incredibly optimistic and clearly naive attempt to fight back. That’s over now as the MIG switch modder has settled for $2 million and an agreement to never touch a mod again in his life.</p> <p>Ryan “Homebrew Homie” Daly had run Modded Hardware, a site that sold modded Switches able to install homebrew or pirated versions of Switch games, and sold the tools with which others could do the same. Nintendo also claimed the site would return Switches with pirated games pre-installed. Back in March 2024, Nintendo threatened to sue Daly over the site, and the two parties agreed that Daly would stop his naughty behavior and the whole thing would go away. Daly said he would, then absolutely didn’t. So in June, Nintendo went to court.</p> <p>Daly continued to make surprising choices. Rather than rush to settle, the entrepreneur instead opted to respond to the complaint denying all wrongdoing, and even more wildly, did this without the advice of any lawyers. He even denied being responsible for the Modded Hardware business, but then given how blatant the site was about its actions, he’d have to.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623987">© Modded Hardware / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TorrentFreak</em></a>, Daly’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/daly-response.pdf">legal response</a> wasn’t exactly stunning legal work. He essentially quoted the accusations and wrote “ANSWER: Denied” underneath them.&nbsp;However, despite all the denials, Daly representing himself added “affirmative defenses” which included fair use, and even accusing Nintendo of a “lack of unclean hands,” a legal doctrine that suggests Nintendo had acted unethically or dishonestly.</p> <p>Well, surprisingly enough this didn’t work out so well. This weekend the Seattle District Court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">released the details of a settlement</a>, in which Daly agrees to pay Nintendo $2 million, as well as hand over the URL of his site, and even agree to the seizure of all his technology that might contain the means to infringe the agreement. It also comes with the most astonishingly strict list of requirements based on what Daly is and isn’t allowed to do for the rest of his life, which goes on for pages and pretty much amounts to never touching another MIG switch or modding tool so long as he lives.</p> <p>Whether Daly can afford to pay the $2 million is largely irrelevant to Nintendo. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">gleefully bankrupted Gary Bowser</a> over his association with a ROM-selling site in 2021, with a $10 million ruling the man will never be able to pay off, along with a gruesome 40 month prison sentence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s always frustrating when your phone dies in the middle of the day when you need it. From trying to order a ride to checking emails or just browsing something to pass the time, running low on battery can spoil it all. If you’d rather never have to go through that again, the solution is simple: grab a decent power bank.</p>
<p>But hold up — not all of these are worth your money. Some charge like they’re trying to break records, some suck their batteries dry too fast, and most are just too bulky to lug around. That’s where Anker enters the scene with a 10,000mAh model that’s our absolute favorite: And <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/">now that Amazon sells it for just $19, reduced from its original price of $26, there’s never been a better time to grab one and add it to your day kit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Fav Power Bank</h2>
<p><strong>Anker PowerCore 10K has a 10,000mAh capacity</strong> which is more than enough to charge <strong>most smartphones two or three times from one recharge</strong>. That’s to say you can go out all day without needing to worry about keeping your phone charged. It also works with tablets such as an iPad, so it’s not just on your phone. As <strong>airplane-friendly as well</strong>, you can even leave it in your carry-on bag without worrying about restrictions.</p>
<p>With Anker’s PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology, <strong>it charges up to 5V/3A</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not waiting around for hours just to have your phone return to a decent battery level. That means charging for the briefest moment can provide you with a genuine boost, something that’s handy if you’re in transit with not much stopping time to refuel. And with<strong> both USB-C in and out and a traditional USB-A port</strong>, it supports both newer and older cables and gives you flexibility regardless of the daily device you’re working with.</p>



<p>With a size about the width of a smartphone, it easily fits into a pocket, small purse or backpack without adding bulk. You won’t wince lugging it around like with some of those other larger battery packs that are brick-like. It still packs enough juice in it to keep you powered up without sacrificing size, which is the reason so many swear by it for daily use and travel.</p>
<p><span>This deal feels like one of those no-brainers that should be grabbed before it disappears: You’re essentially getting travel-ready security for your phone or tablet at a price lower than most cases, and it’s backed by one of the most trusted names in charging.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/08/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-preview-spectral-starfish-and-sponge/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-preview-%E2%80%93-spectral-starfish-and-sponge.1291356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s always a fondness for the games and the franchises that we grew up with, and while the SpongeBob SquarePants games of the early 2000s weren’t exactly gaming haute couture, the underwater denizens of Bikini Bottom have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in recent times, helped along by internet memes and new seasons of the show. After the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/03/spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated-review/"> Battle for Bikini Bottom –&nbsp;Rehydrated</a> remake in 2020, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">The Cosmic Shake</a> in 2023, we now have SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide coming in a few months time.</p>
<p><iframe title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_DRlBipcHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Paddy Shack tussle between King Neptune and the Flying Dutchman goes awry, with SpongeBob and Patrick caught in the crossfire and… well, they get totally deadified, just as ghosts are unleashed across the realms. Still, it’s up to them to save Bikini Bottom, and as they journey across the sea’s many regions and try to get these two grumpy old men to make up. Luckily, there’s just enough life between them to have one of Patrick or SpongeBob kept in corporeal form at a time, with the strength of their friendship and their BFF rings allowing them to swap back and forth in a flash.</p>


<p>That’s right, Patrick is a playable character in this game and is now pretty much an equal to SpongeBob. They both have their own specific abilities, with Patrick able to use a grapple to grab enemies or objects and then throw them, as well as to dive under the ground and quickly burrow around. SpongeBob, meanwhile, has a classic butt stomp and a dash kick.</p>


<p>This gives them some pretty distinct differences and uses when exploring the levels and getting into scuffles with enemies. When facing off against an enemy that launches explosives, SpongeBob has to time a dash kick to turn those explosives back at an enemy, while Patrick can grapple to grab, and then just chuck them back. Of course, you can also just avoid the explosives and go and whale on the enemy to eventually batter them into submission!</p>
<p>But really, this switching mechanic will be great for raising the skill ceiling of the game, potentially making this a speedrunner’s dream. Some of the game challenges, like the more abstract levels of the Plankton Portal Challenges, and trickiest paths in regular levels will need you to switch back and forth, making use of both their abilities in quick succession to get through them. This is still a kids game, though, so you will still be able to complete it and get a full experience without mastering technical button timings, but it’s still great to see this.</p>

<p>Speaking of the levels, the adventure will take you to places like Neptune’s Palace, Atlantic City, Mount Bikini and beyond, and there will be some surprising transformations along the way. Jellyfish Fields, for example, is now all snowed in which… well, it doesn’t make much sense for under the water, but let’s just go with it?</p>
<p>Levels are designed to be more open this time around and really encourage exploration and trying out both sets of abilities. There’s more of a collectathon vibe to the game with hidden chests that will contain currency, costumes, and memorabilia from the adventure that will go back to fill out parts of The Floating Patty, a new restaurant that floats above the sea surface.</p>
<p>After The Cosmic Shake played it a bit too safe as a follow up to Rehydrated, expanding the gameplay with Patrick as a foil to SpongeBob is a great way to inject new life into the series. All of this should be sea shanties to the ears of fans of SpongeBob video games, both young and not-so-young.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158537/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In the run-up to the launch of Bloober Team’s new IP, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, chances are you saw one or two (or ten) comparisons to EA’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/dead_space">Dead Space</a> series. And yes, while there are definitely some similarities between the two, I’d feel more comfortable describing Cronos as an amalgamation of nearly every major survival horror game ever released.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad. In one sense, Cronos is the quintessential survival horror, taking all the best elements from <strong>Resident Evil</strong>, <strong>Silent Hill</strong>, <strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>, and the aforementioned Dead Space, making for an experience that genre fans will relish. On the other hand, it never really attempts anything new to call its own, and although its setting and story certainly elevate it, there’s little here that hasn’t already been done elsewhere.</p>
<p>Taking place primarily within the ruined city of New Dawn, which itself is based upon the historical district of Nowa Huta in Kraków, you take on the role of The Traveler tasked with locating rifts within the world to travel back in time to the 1980s. There, she must extract the ‘essence’ of individuals who perished during a devastating event known as The Change in which humans morphed into grotesque monsters called Orphans.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158538/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cronos’ narrative is undoubtedly the game’s strongest aspect. It presents a consistently intriguing mystery, withholding enough crucial information while giving you <em>just</em> the right amount to keep you invested. Like all great survival horrors, a lot of the backstory is found within the environment, with messages hastily scrawled upon walls, journals revealing more personal struggles during The Change, and government notices urging solidarity in the face of extinction. It’s cool stuff, and I sincerely hope the game does well enough to warrant a sequel or prequel – there’s definitely potential.</p>
<p>The Traveler is also a surprisingly compelling protagonist, though I could understand if some folks don’t gel with her. She’s all business, with a cold, detached, almost robotic demeanour, albeit one that occasionally falters as she begins to struggle with hallucinations. She often comments on her surroundings, and it’s exactly how I imagine Samus would verbally record data as she’s traversing Zebes or Tallon IV… y’know, if you ignore her portrayal in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_other_m">Metroid: Other M</a>. If you’ve played HouseMarque’s PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/returnal">Returnal</a>, you could also draw favourable comparisons with Selene Vassos.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158536/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay is the classic survival horror combination of combat and puzzle-solving, utilising the over-the-shoulder camera perspective made popular by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. You’ll start with a standard pistol, but shotguns, carbines, and rocket launchers are all up for grabs as you progress. Interestingly, in another nod to Metroid, every weapon has a charge shot, which deals significantly more damage and can pierce multiple targets at once. It’s advisable to use this almost exclusively, though the time needed to charge your shot leaves you exposed, naturally.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can upgrade your charge shot — along with almost every aspect of The Traveler’s capabilities — via terminals in safe rooms. You’ll hoard a whole bunch of energy along your travels while also nabbing the odd ‘Core’ (some of which are gifted, believe it or not, by cute cats throughout the game world), the combination of which grants you improved health, weapon damage, and more. The safe rooms themselves are obvious homages to Resident Evil, featuring save stations, storage boxes, and even a relaxed, ethereal background melody to signify that, yes, you can take it easy here.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158541/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Safe rooms are handy because the rest of Cronos is absolutely rife with danger. Just one Orphan can prove deadly if you’re not careful, but facing off against multiple enemies at once is often a recipe for disaster. Careful resource management proves crucial, and this includes procuring fuel for your makeshift flamethrower.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">REmake</a>, downing Orphans often isn’t enough, as others can merge with dead bodies, thus gaining new abilities along with added strength and armour. Burning bodies with a quick tap of ‘L’ will save you a lot of hassle, and this can even be used against active enemies, slowing them down enough to land a charged headshot, using one of Switch 2's multiple control options.</p>
<p>You can use the standard twin-stick setup if you wish, and this is perfectly viable, but I opted for a combination of stick aiming and gyro controls. This worked really well for me after tinkering with the sensitivity, but you might be enticed by the additional mouse controls. You can set Mouse Mode to either the left or right Joy-Con, and it makes for a pretty accurate option once you get used to the increased sensitivity. I didn't much care for it, but this is less a commentary on the game and more Switch 2's mouse functionality in general.</p>

<p>Some of the very best survival horrors strike an excellent balance between giving you agency against your enemies while encouraging you to avoid unnecessary encounters. Unfortunately, this is one area where Cronos falters. Should the Orphans spot you (which in many scenarios is almost guaranteed), they prove to be exceptionally quick and relentless, making running away a tricky proposition, especially in more claustrophobic environments. As such, you’re often forced to engage in combat whether you want to or not, and this can severely diminish the sense of fear, making enemies less of a threat and more of a nuisance.</p>
<p>While the creatures eventually lose their initial impact from a gameplay perspective, the excellent visual design remains consistent throughout. Though not particularly gory, it's a very <em>gooey</em> game, with writhing masses plastered over walls and floors through which enemies often emerge with a rather sickening squelch.</p>
<p>In fact, the sound design is great across the board. The voice acting is particularly strong, with a great performance from headliner Kelly Burke as The Traveler, along with a host of actors portraying support characters, with plenty of audio logs to nab throughout. The synth-heavy soundtrack is also a real treat, lending the sci-fi setting a good sense of atmosphere.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158534/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for how Cronos holds up on Switch 2, it’s mostly good news. You’re looking at a pretty solid 30fps which occasionally struggles during more hectic encounters, though it’s rarely anything to be too concerned about. To achieve this, visual cutbacks have been made; you’ll sometimes see assets that look like they’ve not fully loaded in, but no, that's intentional in order to achieve a stable frame rate. Although The Traveler looks fine in her elaborate sci-fi getup, characters without helmets or other face coverings can look a little iffy.</p>
<p>There’s one major technical issue that needs addressing, too, and it’s one that Bloober Team is aware of and keen to fix ASAP. Currently, if you start playing the game in handheld mode and switch over to docked mode, it hard crashes; just straight-up shuts down and kicks you back to the home screen. While I appreciated the heads-up beforehand, this is the kind of issue that might make your average consumer seek a refund; it’s absurd. You’re playing the game on the Switch 2, and you can’t… y'know, <em>switch</em>. We’re confident this will be fixed very soon, but for now, stick to either docked or handheld mode and refrain from switching mid-game.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't quite reach the heights of Bloober Team's excellent <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, it's nevertheless the result of a studio that has levelled up significantly from the days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blair_witch">Blair Witch</a>. It's a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original.</p>
<p>That said, the setting and story really help elevate the experience. This is a solid Switch 2 version (assuming a rather unpleasant bug gets fixed soon), and there's real potential here for Cronos to become a central pillar of the genre going forward, should Bloober choose to expand upon it in the future.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-meat-boy-3d-preview-perfect-adaptation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-meat-boy-3d-preview-a-perfect-adaptation.1291350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Super Meat Boy</em> will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/super-meat-boy-10th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">always be remembered</a> not only as an amazing and novel platformer but an undeniably important game in the rise of the indie gaming scene. It has quite the legacy and seeing the recent reveal taking it to 3D, I was skeptical to say the least.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Meat Boy</em> is well-known for its fast, punishing gameplay that is all about trying over and over again. You might eventually finish a level under 15 seconds, but you died 30 times to get to that one perfect run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, <em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em> maintains all of that. That same classic feeling of try, die, try again is back and in glorious 3D. I’m sure that I was not the only one who was afraid we might see some strange open world collectathon take on <em>Meat Boy</em>, but thankfully I can say that's not the case.</p>



<p>I played close to 10 or so levels from <em>Super Meat Boy 3D,</em> and they all felt like classic <em>Super Meat Boy</em>. They were lean, punishing, and exacting. Finally getting the rhythm of one section to the next was just as satisfying now as it was 15 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most importantly, controlling Meat Boy has been translated perfectly to 3D. Meat Boy is fast, splats to walls, and slides just as you’d expect. He’s also just as floaty and you have a lot of control while he’s in the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meat Boy’s movement can create some issues while playing, though. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving around so quickly and in 3D space, the camera has to follow Meat Boy. The viewpoint is quite a wide view to see a lot of the level, but Meat Boy is small in the center of your screen. That means that it is sometimes very difficult to gauge where Meat Boy is in terms of depth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were more than a few times I whiffed a jump completely as I didn’t realize that Meat Boy was that far out. I’m not sure how, but something to make that more clear would help immensely on some levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One smaller problem comes up sometimes, too, though way less frequently. With the open nature of 3D, there are some shortcuts you can use to quickly make your way through the level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The few times I found and used one, the camera moved quicker than it had before and there were brief moments the foreground blocked what I could see. Again, though, those were pretty few and far between.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A final thing I want to mention is the visual design. A big part of the original game is the huge blood sprays and blood covering saws, walls, and more as you die again and again. That is of course a part of <em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em>, and it all looks great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art style is cartoony and bright in some respects, but it makes for a great contrast to the bloody nature of the carnage being wreaked on poor ol’ Meat Boy. Plus, I don’t know if I’m ever going to get old of seeing a saw cut Meat Boy in half, one part of his body thrown across the level and flopping about. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Super Meat Boy 3D Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Overall, I was incredibly impressed with<em> Super Meat Boy 3D </em>and think it’s a great example of how to translate the gameplay people fell in love with to the 3D space. All the signs are there that this will be a great platformer for everyone and the perfect game for <em>Super Meat Boy</em> fans.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Shhhhh. If we're quiet, we might be able to avoid discourse with this one. If you've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">spent your weekend playing</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and found that the likes of enemies inflicting double damage and spawns being miles away put a dampner on the fun, mods can help. </p>
<p>I know, I know, these are videogames and we must take their difficulty with the utmost seriousness. How else are any of us supposed to learn important life lessons, like 'press button dodge at this point', unless we go through hours of frustration trying to beat one boss (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-and-tricks">look such info up</a>)? As such, I stress that these mods, like all mods, are entirely optional. No need to shout at people for using them. Save your voice for singing love ballads to Hornet during breaks in the action.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right, now I've addressed the very powerful elephant in the room, let's take a gander at Skong's Nexus Mods page, which has filled out nicely now the metroidvania's got a weekend under its belt. Silksong's most endorsed mod thus far is one by Baiker that stops enemies and "normal bosses" from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/16">dishing out double damage</a>, while leaving hazards free to keep on punishing you. Don't look at the comments on it, if you've not got your internet argument observation popcorn handy.</p>
<p>Also up there in both the download and endorsement rankings is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/28">a mod</a> from XiaoHaiNB, which adds health bars and damage numbers to baddies. Probably my favourites so far are the death counters. You've got a choice of two from modders <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/18">Rexxah</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/14">NordboDev</a>, and they'll just sit there on your HUD, reminding you how many times your abilities have proven to be a bit too hollow shite.</p><p>Going back to the easening up, there's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent. As you might expect, this one takes a bit of inspiration from FromSoft's Ancient Hoop by ensuring that "when you die in a scene, you will respawn at the scene entrance instead of at a bench miles away". It also lets you set custom respawn points, which is cool.</p>
<p>For those annoyed by Silksong's insistence on not being able to check where you are on the map at a glance, there's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21">Always Have Compass Effect</a>' by Synthlight, which does what it says on the tin. The same modder's stepped in with a mod that makes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/53">delivery items less fragile</a> than a shipment of unpacked wine glasses precariously balanced to form a 20 foot tall tower and positioned next to some partially lit fireworks.</p>
<p>The final mod that's caught my eye so far is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/25">this one</a> for lore enthusiasts, which ensures you only have to kill a single enemy to be able to read their species' journal entry.</p>
<p>Make sure to check the requirements of each of these if you fancy giving them a go, as most require the likes of <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/">BepInEx</a> and <a href="https://melonloader.co/">MelonLoader</a> to get up and running.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sold-at-73-off-this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-and-384gb-storage-is-flying-off-amazons-shelves-2000623973</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sold-at-73-off-this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-and-384gb-storage-is-flying-off-amazon%E2%80%99s-shelves.1291341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP has dozens of laptops in its lineup right now, but there’s one model that still commands attention because it combines price, performance (Intel N150, 384GB storage, 32GB RAM, Microsoft 365), and daily use practicality. On Amazon, it has collected well <strong>over 1,500 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5</strong> when bought at full price, but now the story is quite different: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3965/">at a whopping 73% discount, this HP “everyday” laptop costs just $399 compared to its normal price of $1,499</a>. And then on top of that discount, Amazon tosses in some extras straight into the box (wireless mouse, optical drive, 256GB SD card, and 1-Year Office 365) which makes this deal not worth passing up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3965/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Does $399 Get You?</h2>
<p>For starters, you’re getting a reliable <strong>machine powered by Intel’s Quad-Core N150 processor</strong> which at clock speeds up to 3.4GHz provides smooth performance for day-to-day use. Which is to say, from streaming and surfing to document work and hopping on Zoom calls, everything is responsive. The integrated Intel UHD graphics chip serves up smooth video for casual gaming or just reading content online.</p>
<p>Then toss that in with <strong>32GB of RAM and it becomes even smoother</strong>:&nbsp;switching between apps isn’t hung up, and demanding tasks run without forcing you to close programs all the time. Storage capacity will not be a problem either: you’ve got 128GB of UFS onboard, and then there’s a provided 256GB SD card, which brings your <strong>storage to a whopping 384GB</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where things get very interesting: Microsoft 365 comes with the laptop (you <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">can download it here</a>). You receive <strong>a year’s subscription in full (worth $130)</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even the <strong>AI-powered version with Copilot thrown in</strong>. Think of having Word for writing papers or reports, Excel for calculating with pre-formatted formulas, PowerPoint for creating professional-grade presentations, Outlook to sort your email, and even Teams for working online. The Copilot AI feature in Office makes tasks like summarizing papers, writing messages, and scheduling calendars faster and more hands-off.</p>



<p>It doesn’t stop there, though. Aside from Office 365, the laptop package includes a <strong>wireless mouse and an optical drive</strong>, two easy but useful features that spare you the trouble of rushing to the store for accessories on purchasing day. A DVD drive in 2025 is not standard, but it’s useful if you’ve got old discs with photos, films, or software that you still want to use</p>
<p>On the software side, Windows 11 Pro powers all this and couples clean looks with helpful features like Snap Layouts to keep windows neatly organized on screen. For something portable and lightweight, the 14-inch version fits easily into a backpack and won’t weigh you down. Battery life is also good enough to get you through a day of use without having to be constantly recharged, another plus if you find yourself stuck away from a desk for hours.</p>
<p>Deals at this level don’t usually stick around long when word gets out, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3965/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <p>In good news for those saddened by their inability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFPl27xoxg">stamp on Hitler's head</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are once again making noises about developing a third Wolfenstein game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">a No-Clip documentary</a> about the previous two MachineGames-created Wolfenstein games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a> - studio head Jerk Gustafsson commented briefly that they still have an outline for a third game, and "hope" to someday complete the story of B.J. Blazkowicz.</p>
<p>"That journey for BJ, even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [BJ], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," the developer observed. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p>
<p>I find the prospect of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames... interesting. Few big budget shooters have courted the thunder of Topicality quite like New Colossus, an alternate-history fable set in a United States that has been conquered by the Nazis. Back in 2017, I offered some rather grandiose and theory-drenched Opinions about how New Colossus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-politics">"takes the white dudebro hero apart"</a>, following the election of Donald Trump. Hunter Pauli <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/b-j-blazkowicz-and-the-shallow-diversity-of-games">wrote a great rebuttal</a>, commenting that "for a series built around the deconstruction of Aryan bodies, it's taken a long time for players to take the hint that Wolfenstein's ubermensch William Blazkowicz is Jewish."</p><p>I don't know about you, but 2017 feels like a billion years ago to me. Since then, Trump has won a second term and initiated a bunch of crackpot and draconian measures against migrants and marginalised people. Russia have invaded Ukraine in what has become the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. Israel are shelling and starving hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza with the US government's backing - an invasion that has contributed to a crisis of legitimacy in the USA and UK, where elites characterise support for Palestinians as terrorism.</p>
<p>I do not envy any Wolfenstein writer trying to make something approximating a mainstream commercial first-person shooter that alludes to any of this. But then again, there is no such thing as "a simpler time".</p>
<p>In terms of the business of games development, the ground has also shifted considerably beneath MachineGames' feet. They're now owned by Microsoft, via the latter's purchase of ZeniMax Media. Microsoft, of course, are on something of a cost-cutting spree. As reported by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106506/machinegames-financials-reveals-indiana-jones-developer-has-6-profit-margin/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook">Tweaktown</a>, MachineGames made <a href="https://www.allabolag.se/bokslut/machinegames-sweden-ab/uppsala/datautveckling-systemutveckling-programutveckling/2K34T6JI5YDOJ">a small profit in 2024</a>, but that means nothing without understanding how it fits into the parent company's wider fortunes. MachineGames have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wolfenstein-machinegames-cancelled-unannounced/">cancelled at least one unannounced game between 2022 and 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, stand accused of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">abetting the genocide in Gaza while quelling internal criticism of their business links to Israel</a>. A number of ZeniMax staff have signed an <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">open letter</a> calling for Microsoft to divest from the Israeli armed forces.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2700-dell-laptop-is-practically-free-right-now-with-amazon-clearing-stock-until-it-sells-out-2000623966</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell is one of those omnipresent American brands that dominate the mass laptop market, and if you need to gear up for back-to-school or switch out your office configuration, Amazon just debuted a deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Now, the Dell Inspiron <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/">15-inch touchscreen laptop (Intel 10 Core i5 1334U, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD) can be purchased for $699, down from its usual $2,699 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 74% discount</strong> and it brings a premium-level device into a price range that feels almost unbelievable. On top of that, you’ll get a <strong>free 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Yet Affordable</h2>
<p>The heart of this device is its <strong>13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor which has 10 cores and 12 threads</strong> to make multitasking responsive without slowing you down. Toss in generous 32GB of DDR4 RAM and you have the room to run all your day-to-day applications and resource-intensive tasks simultaneously without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD also offers plenty of space for files, movies, and downloads, and keeps start-up quick and applications snappy. No longer just sitting around waiting for stuff to load: everything just opens up immediately. For students with speedy access needed to class material or businesspeople working on large projects, that kind of performance is a huge difference in everyday use.</p>



<p>And of course, the screen is a major part of the experience and Dell hasn’t cut corners on it: This Inspiron laptop<strong> features a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> with an anti-glare finish and narrow borders so you enjoy sharp images and vibrant colors without distracting reflections. It’s the kind of screen that makes video calls clear and day-to-day browsing easier on the eyes. Combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics, you’ll also enjoy smoother graphics for light gaming or creative use like photo editing.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is offered in this laptop, so you’ll get faster and more stable internet connections which is perfect if you spend a lot of time streaming, working from home, or on video calls. On top of Bluetooth and a solid port set, like Type-C, Type-A, HDMI, and even an SD card reader, you already have enough flexibility to attach your favorite peripherals or extend your setup with ease. And to top it all off, <strong>the bundle includes an 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>&nbsp;so more ports to connect external monitors, storage devices, or even wired broadband with RJ-45.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro in S Mode comes pre-installed with business-ready features available along with a personal and streamlined environment. That is, you can upgrade your workflow from day one without the additional time of configuring. And yet the device depends on performance and functionality without compromising on a sleek, modern design in black that slices well on a desk or on the move.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t tend to linger long during high-demand periods like back-to-school, so if you’ve been considering an upgrade, this price drop makes the decision an easy one.</p>

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the third entry in the series created by Hideo Kojima, the pachislot version released a few years ago doesn't look bad at all, even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5 remake developed by Virtuos in some regards.</p>



<p>Two new comparison videos shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> on YouTube put the remake running side by side with the HD remake developed by Bluepoint which was re-released two years ago as part of the Master Collection Vol.1 on PC and consoles and recordings of the same cutscenes recreated for the pachislot version of the game, highlighting how the latter don't look bad at all, sometimes even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake in some instances like lighting, although this was to be expected, considering these cutscenes are not running in real time.</p>

<p>Despite launching with issues, including a 60 FPS cap on PC, which can be increased with mods, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven to be a smashing success, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">a million seller</a> right on day one, as confirmed by Konami last week. The game's success on the market was fully expected, considering this is the first new release in the series in a long time and the fact that all the changes made to the original experience enhance it quite a bit without taking away what still makes Snake Eater one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-trainer-plush-n-marnie-lillie-2000623942</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-finally-lets-us-cuddle-the-trainers.1291299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For too long <em>Pokémon</em> games have set us as rivals to other trainers, forced to complete against the likes of N, Leon and Marnie, rather than provide them with what they truly need: support and love. But thankfully that’s all about to end with the arrival of trainer plushies on the Pokémon Center store.</p> <p>It’s quite something that this hasn’t happened before. But as The Pokémon Company continues its true purpose—<a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-evolved-pokemon-plush-gengar-gardevoir-2000618808">creating plushies of everything imaginable</a>—its attention has finally turned to the human component of the games. Five trainers have arrived on the store in snuggly form: Lillie (<em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>)<em>,</em> Cynthia (<em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>)<em>,</em> N (<em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>), Leon, and Marnie (both <em>Sword</em> and<em> Shield</em>). Each is depicted in a chibi style, rather than their more lifelike appearance in the games, between seven and nine inches tall.</p> <p>There do seem good reasons to have gone for the short, big-headed chibi approach, given the somewhat <em>problematic</em> nature of some fans’ relationships with the human characters in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games. Characters like Lillie, for instance, are 11, while people like Marnie and Cynthia are ambiguously aged, most likely a teenager and a 20-something respectively. Within the world of the card game, such characters tend to fetch the highest resale prices, with the grim term “waifu tax” usually applied. (N is 20, and Leon is “an adult” for what it’s worth, while Leon’s little brother Hop surprisingly isn’t included in this first set.) Life-size plushies of any of them would be…a whole thing, and even to-scale renditions could get weird. Certainly even more troubling ground than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-life-sized-gardevoir-plush-import-center-buy-1851752663">$449 life-size Gardevoir</a> that’s as <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10419-101/gardevoir-poke-plush-63-in">sold out</a> as you’d expect.</p>

 <p>Anyway, the result is super-cute human plushies for the very first time. Leon seems like a great choice, especially if you buy a Charizard to go with him, but I imagine N and Marnie will be the two most popular, given the former was such a charming rival in&nbsp;<em>Black&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>White</em> as the leader of Team Plasma, while Marnie’s meanness and Dark-type preferences made her the most entertaining rival in&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em>.</p> <p>It does rather raise the question of which other game characters should receive the plushie transition. My preference has to be&nbsp;<em>Diamond</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>‘s Barry, but purely because “Barry” is such a funny name for a child to have. It is a name only allowed to truck drivers in their 40s. No child should ever be called Barry. Carmine from&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC is another obvious choice, because she was just so damn cool. Oh, and to state the obvious, Misty and Brock! Oh, and please may we not forget Opal. Presumably the only reason there’s no Grusha in this first set is because it’s impossible to capture that beautiful boy in any doll.</p> <p>Oh it got weird again.</p> <p>These new trainer plushies are currently available on the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-au/category/new-releases">Australian</a>, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/new-releases">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-nz/category/new-releases">New Zealand</a> stores, and will appear on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the U.S. store</a> in the next couple of hours.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a more challenging game than its predecessor, but a few mods released online in the past few days can make the experience more manageable and fun without breaking the difficulty and making the entire experience a walk in the park.</p>



<p>An essential mod to download, even for those who aren't finding the game too difficult, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21?">Always Have Compass Effect mod</a>, which always shows Hornet's position on the map without equipping the Compass, freeing up a charm slot for more beneficial effects. Unfortunately, this mod isn't compatible with the Game Pass version of the game.</p>



<p>Another Hollow Knight: Silksong mod that can make the experience more balanced without breaking difficulty is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/57">No More 2 Damage Plus mod</a>, which reduces every damage Hornet takes to just one point per hit. While this sounds like a small tweak, it's actually a rather big one against certain enemies with rapid-hitting attacks that can destroy Hornet quickly, making the game somewhat more fair.</p>



<p>The third and final Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, which can improve the experience considerably, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/55?tab=description">All Enemies Drop Rosary Beads</a>, which does exactly what its name suggests, making every enemy in the game drop Rosary Beads when defeated, instead of just the few enemies in the vanilla game. The formula used to calculate how many Beads an enemy drops is based on the extra bead = floor(max health / 5), which some are finding to be a little too much, but if you don't care about breaking the in-game's economy, this is a very useful mod to install.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlaYStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo doesn't really need to create new franchises, a former developer has said, explaining that the company can simply wrap its fresh gameplay ideas into one of the many beloved video game series it owns already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, programmer Ken Watanabe said Nintendo doesn't "really fuss over" which of its big franchises a fun new gameplay mechanic might end up in. And, with so many existing series to chose from, there's little need to come up with more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"New franchises haven't come out simply because there's no real need to make them," Watanabe said. "When Nintendo wants to do something new, it's basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At Nintendo, Watanabe worked on Super Mario Bros. Wii, Pikmin 3 and Splatoon — one of the company's biggest new franchises of its modern era. But even the first Splatoon is now a decade old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for the skin or the wrapper, they don't really fuss over it," Watanabe continued. "They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's long list of existing IP certainly seems expansive and beloved enough to support this. Why make a new spaceship combat series when it's been years since the last Star Fox? Why create a fresh arcade racer when you could make a new F-Zero? (Though, let's be real, Nintendo is never making a new,  fully fledged F-Zero.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo already has most genres covered, and existing fans waiting with baited breath for the next entries in series such as Animal Crossing, Pikmin and Fire Emblem. It makes sense that, if Nintendo did have new gameplay ideas for existing genres, it could just co-opt one of its existing series too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, for example, which Nintendo has described as "the first Splatoon series spin-off." It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-just-announced-splatoon-raiders-for-switch-2-with-a-trailer-exclusive-to-the-nintendo-today-app">looks set to focus on a specific hero character and potentially feature more adventure-led gameplay than its quick-fire shooting predecessors</a>. Could this have been a new IP instead? Maybe, but spinning it off from the hugely popular Splatoon means it instantly appeals to an existing fanbase and has better brand recognition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn't completely ditched the idea of new franchises, of course — though it's fair to say that the company tests fewer new IPs now than it once did. Nintendo's most recent new idea was the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">Drag x Drive</a>, its wheelchair basketball game that utilised the Switch 2's motion controls. It's hard to see how that could have fitted into an existing franchise — though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">maybe plonking Mario and friends into its arenas might have helped</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The technology is being used once again for Saber’s 2026 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Saber development chief Tim Willits said 30 million people had played World War Z since launch, which is a remarkable milestone for any game. But, he thinks its popularity might have influenced some decisions made in Hollywood, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/david-ellison-top-gun-star-trek-1236343043/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250814" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> said Paramount had three franchises it planned to prioritize when it came to movies: Top Gun 3, Star Trek, and World War Z. World War Z was the biggest surprise here, given it’s been over a decade since the movie came out. So why is Paramount interested in making a follow-up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Saber’s World War Z. Willits said it was his feeling (he hasn’t been told this is the case in an official capacity) that the enduring success of the World War Z video game over the last six years has directly contributed to Paramount’s desire to revive the franchise in movie terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“30 million people have played that game. Isn't that crazy? 30 million unique people,” Willits began. “They have not told me this — I'll probably get in trouble! — they have not told me this, but maybe IGN put this on Instagram, that there's talk at Paramount about making another World War Z. Again, they have not told me this, but I'm pretty sure it’s because of that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They have not told me this. I'm guessing!” Willits continued. “30 million people. That's f***ing ridiculous! I saw that [the Paramount news] and I was like, ‘Oh that’s gotta be us.’”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Zombie Movies</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first time an effort to make World War Z 2 was started. World War Z was a commercial success upon its release in 2013, grossing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/world-war-z-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film">over $540 million worldwide at the box office</a> (it was Pitt's highest-grossing film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-overtaking-world-war-z">before the recently released F1 movie overtook it</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount confirmed its plans to make a sequel shortly after, but planning turned patchy after Marc Foster, director of the first film, announced that he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/06/paramount-halts-preproduction-on-world-war-z-sequel">would not be returning to helm</a> the second feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a further shake-up that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/david-fincher-reportedly-closing-in-on-directing-world-war-z-sequel">resulted in David Fincher signing on</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/world-war-z-sequel-loses-director-bayona">J.A. Bayona's replacement</a> in the director's chair. However, the sequel never pulled together as Paramount decided to halt pre-production in 2019, reportedly due to budget issues and a lack of momentum, even though production was supposed to begin that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/david-fincher-cancelled-world-war-z-sequel-a-little-like-the-last-of-us">Fincher likened his scrapped World War Z sequel to HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation</a>, saying he was glad his movie didn't make it beyond pre-production. Fincher told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/david-fincher-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> that there were some notable similarities between his Brad Pitt-fronted follow-up film to World War Z and the HBO adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, so much so that he was left feeling happy his project never came together because he felt the other had "more real estate" to tackle the same topics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was a little like The Last of Us," Fincher said, teasing what he had planned for the World War Z sequel. "I'm glad that we didn't do what we were doing because The Last of Us has a lot more real estate to explore the same stuff. In our title sequence, we were going to use the little parasite... they used it in their title sequence and in that wonderful opening with the Dick Cavett, David Frost-style talk show."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/gettyimages-526328424-1757318690970.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will Brad Pitt return for World War Z 2?

Meanwhile, any new World War Z movie would clearly benefit Saber’s game, and perhaps spark a conversation about a video game sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not supposed to say anything, but we have cool stuff to talk about in that game in the future,” is all Willits would tease about World War Z.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more from our interview with Willits, including his comments on how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">a large chunk of fans have “assumptions” about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are incorrect as a result of the huge success of the game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delaying-space-marine-2-was-the-smartest-thing-we-ever-did-saber-reflects-on-the-biggest-warhammer-40000-game-of-all-time-after-a-year-of-dlc-and-looks-to-the-future"><u>why delaying Space Marine 2 was the best thing Saber ever did</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing">vague excitement about Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"Defendant’s conduct has caused NOA significant and irreparable harm"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd095a686ee4e/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has won yet another lawsuit in its ongoing battle against piracy on the Switch and Switch 2, this time against 'MiG Switch' distributor Ryan Daly and the Modded Hardware website.</p>
<p>Updated on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">court document</a> confirms that Daly is required to pay Nintendo a total of $2 million in damages (thanks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-wins-a-2-million-lawsuit-against-popular-switch-modding-webstore-174528989.html">Engadget</a>). In addition, a permanent injunction has been entered against Daly, preventing him from engaging in any activities that might be linked to the selling, marketing, or promotion of piracy devices such as the 'MiG Switch' and 'MiG Dumper'.</p>
<p>The injunction goes so far as to prevent Daly from accessing any device that may be hacked or in some way tampered with to circumvent Nintendo's protective measures. The Modded Hardware website has also been shut down, and Daly has been ordered to surrender all relevant website domains to Nintendo that may include company-owned content.</p>
<p>A key segment of the document reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant’s conduct has caused NOA significant and irreparable harm. For example, the MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale. Thus, the MIG devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services harm NOA's goodwill, detract from NOA's consumer base, and enable widespread illegal and difficult to detect copying."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a pretty comprehensive win for Nintendo, and comes after it was reported that Switch consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-might-want-to-be-careful-buying-pre-owned-switch-1-games-for-your-switch-2">could effectively be 'bricked'</a> if discovered to be accessing pirated content, causing quite a kerfuffle for second-hand buyers.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been relentless in its pursuit against piracy in recent years, with a major Switch ROM Site – 'nsw2u' – being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/the-fbi-has-seized-a-switch-rom-site-as-part-of-a-law-enforcement-operation">seized by the FBI</a> as part of a 'law enforcement operation', while also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-has-seemingly-taken-possession-of-the-ryujinx-switch-emulator-website">taking full possession of the 'Ryujinx' ROM site</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is not precisely a puzzle-heavy survival horror game, but that doesn't mean that you won't have to collect and place items correctly or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/">discover passcodes</a> to open up locked doors. In most cases, doors locked with passcodes are not mandatory to unlock to proceed in the main mission, but they should still be opened to obtain always-needed resources and additional items that can be used to solve puzzles, which unlock new weapons when completed.</p>



<p>This is the case of the <strong>locked door found in the Hospital Director's room</strong>. The first time you encounter this room will be while The Traveler has to explore Unity Hospital to obtain three samples to synthesize the Biomass Dissolving Toxin. No sample is hidden inside this room, but you will still want to open it to <strong>get an item required to complete the Chapel's puzzle located near the main save point on the first floor of the Hospital.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting gas cans in Cronos: The New Dawn is often the solution to puzzles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To discover the passcode</strong>, you must proceed in the same wing as the Director's Room until you reach a massive room with a lot of Biomass. From this room's entrance, head to the left until you reach <strong>a blocked door on your left, and a crouching point in front of you</strong>. Press the X or B button to enter a new area and then turn to the left where you will find a window with a broken window looking into the locked room. Shoot the gas can to burn the Biomass blocking the door to be able to enter the room, grab every item, and check the document, which will tell you the locked room passcode: <strong>9509</strong>. You can also input the passcode directly without discovering the document first, in case you are not in the mood for some exploration.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Chalice found inside the locked room in Cronos: The New Dawn Hospital Director's room</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Inside the room, you will find some resources as well as the Chalice, which can be used to complete the aforementioned Chapel puzzle and, in turn, obtain the Mace JER-5120 shotgun, a modified variant of the regular Hammer shotgun which trades charged shots with a powerful double shot.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox have gotten the ball rolling on the "adjustments" they promised in response to the controversy over the game's day-one paid DLC vampire clans.</p>
<p>As we've covered previously, the Toreador and Lasombra clans were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">originally revealed</a> to be locked behind a purchase of either Bloodines' £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC pack, or the £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 premium edition that said DLC comes bundled with. Cue understandable unhappiness, and Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-making-adjustments-to-bloodlines-2s-day-one-vampire-clan-dlc-plans-following-backlash">swiftly moving to declare they'd rejig some stuff before launch</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first domino's now fallen, and it's refunds for PlayStation pre-orderers. "Anyone who pre-ordered the premium edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday, September 8th," World of Darkness community developer DebbieElla announced on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1413574860512170158">Bloodlines 2 Discord</a>. "You will be able to pre-order your premium edition copy again later, before the release on October 21st."</p>
<p>The good news for us PC folks is that Paradox made clear this is just an "intentional first step" in their planned tweaks following the backlash. "We are working hard on the adjustments that we promised, and we will be able to tell you all the details on September 17th," DebbieElla wrote. "Making significant changes like this involves many moving parts, and we want to make sure that we get it right with this change."</p><p>So, a little longer to wait for info as to whether there'll be changes to the DLC/editions and their pricing on PC. However, pulling existing pre-orders and then requesting folks make them again points towards a premium edition price drop being at least one of the measures Paradox are taking. Any change might make paying extra for the two clans a bit more palatable, but unless the premium edition's brought down to match the price of the base game, dishing the DLC clans out at no extra cost, odds are the sour taste won't come close to being washed away.</p>
<p>Paradox and Bloodlines developers The Chinese Room previously defended charging for Toreador and Lasombra vamps when our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">asked them about the decision at Gamescom</a>, citing the game's changing scope.</p>
<p>"We have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it," Bloodlines 2 narrative director Ian Thomas said.</p>
<p>We'll keep you in the loop as to what Paradox announce on the 17th, and keep on hoping that Bloodlines 2 will stop all this Sideshow Bob rake-stepping as it tries to position itself as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">"spiritual successor" to Bloodlines</a>.</p>

			<p>Like many modern games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> hardly ends when the main campaign is completed. After experiencing one of the two endings and seeing the credits roll, a couple of new play modes are unlocked - <strong>New Game Plus and Hard Mode.</strong> While at a glance, Hard Mode may have more to offer to those who mastered the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">core mechanics</a>, <strong>New Game Plus may be more worthwhile to go through</strong>, as it provides something to those who have enjoyed the game's story.</p>



<p>Regarding gameplay differences, New Game Plus mode in Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't offer much. <strong>Item and enemy placement will be the same as in the first playthrough</strong>, so you should be able to breeze through this mode with relative ease, considering you will<strong> keep every upgrade unlocked during your first playthrough</strong>. As such, playing the game again in New Game Plus mode is the only way to <strong>unlock some of the Trophies and Achievements</strong>, including the May It Serve You Fault-Free achievement for fully upgrading a single weapon, The Praetorian for fully upgrading every weapon, and Forged In Fire for fully upgrading the Temporal Shell.</p>



<p><em><strong>SPOILER ALERT - Avoid reading below the screenshot if you haven't completed the game, as there are plenty of spoilers ahead regarding late-game beats and endings.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, even if you aren't a Trophy or Achievement hunter, you will have a very good reason to complete Cronos: The New Dawn's New Game Plus mode if you have loved the game's story. After defeating The Pathfinder on the Clocktower at the end of the game, you will be presented with<strong> three choices</strong> instead of two, and by picking the <strong>Begin Anew</strong> choice, you will unlock <strong>Ending C</strong>, which is, possibly, the most hopeful ending of the three, and one that all those who liked the story will surely appreciate.</p>

            <p>Alright, sweethearts. What are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed? Another glorious day feeding the Maw. A day feeding the Maw is like a day on the farm - every update's a banquet, every DLC a fortune, every quarterly earnings call a parade. I LOVE the Maw!

<h2>Monday 8th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Trainatic</a> is about building a teeny train out of candy-coloured gun parts and seeing how far you can chugalong, chugalong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 9th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478050/Road_To_Empress/">Road To Empress</a> doesn't appear to involve any road-building. It's a lush FMV adventure set in Tang Dynasty China.</li>
<li>I hope you've been dusting your anvil regularly, because it's time for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s Legacy of the Forge expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 10th September</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have room in your heart for another metriovainglorious, eerily roguelit endeavour, consider <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Katanaut</a>, in which you are a dude with swords aboard a space station full of muties.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Star Birds</a> is about pigeons building spacebases on asteroids, then linking them up into production networks. No muties in these spacebases, but perhaps you find the idea of entrepreneurial space pigeons even more horrifying.</li>
<li>If Road To Empress got you in the mood for more games set in ancient China, here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509970/Celestial_Empire_Prologue/">the prologue for city-builder Celestial Empire</a> (pictured).</li>
<li>I'm pretty sure I read in the weekend wappity that one of you regulars is currently binging X4. It's got some chunky <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3778100/X4_Envoy_Pack/">DLC out today</a>.</li>
<li>I'm also pretty sure a non-zero quantity of you are still playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. The first major DLC pack, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596900/Dune_Awakening__Lost_Harvest_DLC/">Lost Harvest</a>, is also out today. It's got a new vehicle and much underground peril.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 11th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has crossed the border into our lands, for better or worse. Randy Pitchford's piano ties aren't going to pay for themselves.</li>
<li>Sweet merciful crap, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">tandem simulator</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 12th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3361510/Coal_LLC/">Coal LLC</a> doesn't look much like your great grand-daddy's coal mining operation, unless he also had wings and carried out excavations with a Gatling gun.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-trolley-solution">The Trolley Solution</a> is a compilation of minigames dedicated to perhaps the most-memed moral quandary.</li>
<li>I am a medium-to-large fan of the temporal platforming shenanigans on show in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081840/Chrono_Gear_Warden_of_Time/">Chrono Gear: Warden of Time</a>, though its connection to the Hololive universe confuses me.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667950/Gloomy_Eyes/">Gloomy Eyes</a> is a Burtonesque chiller in which one playable character can't stand light, while the other needs it to survive.</li>
</ul><p>


All right sweethearts, you heard the man and you know the drill. Assholes and elbows! Warren, come here! Come <em>here</em>.
