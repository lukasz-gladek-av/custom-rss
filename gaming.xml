			<p><strong>Highguard</strong> was the surprise 'one more thing' game shown at the end of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, a new free-to-play, PvP 'raid shooter' from <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, a studio made up of former <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/titanfall/">Titanfall 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a></strong> developers, all joining together to launch their own first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Today, the new shooter went live across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, following a 25-minute gameplay and launch showcase, with founder, studio head, and game director <strong>Chad Grenier</strong> and design and creative director <strong>Jason McCord</strong> taking players through the ins and outs of Highguard, and what exactly the studio means when it calls the game a 'raid shooter.'</p>



<p>The basics of Highguard are that it is a 3v3 first-person shooter, where two teams of three start on either end of one of the five available maps at launch, each in one of six base types. The objective of the game is to acquire a big magical sword called the <strong>Shieldbreaker</strong>, to break down the shield protecting the enemy base. Once the shield is down, you then have to work your way through the enemy base and destroy three generators to destroy the entire base and win the match.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You play as a Warden, one of eight magical characters, each with their own unique abilities that shake up combat in various ways, equipping yourself with one of ten weapons on top of one of three stronger, limited-use Raid weapons. Being a Warden also leads to one of Highguard's other wrinkles, the fact that you travel across the map not on foot, but on one of three mounts, which are a horse, a panther, and a bear.</p>



<p>Essentially, Highguard is a whole mish-mash of game types, distilled into something new with its own twists. Capturing and keeping control of the Shieldbreaker is a bit of Capture the Flag, while the larger-scale maps and boxes of loot that can be found across them, each packed with better weapons and armour, feel like it pulls from popular battle royale titles, namely Apex Legends in this case. And because you're planting bombs that can be defused by enemy players if you're not careful, the attacking and defending of bases is like adding a touch of Search and Destroy.</p>

<p>Highguard's placement as the final game revealed at The Game Awards 2025 meant that there was a lot of discussion around the game, namely around whether it was the right choice of title to end the show. But also because players weren't entirely clear on what kind of game Highguard is trying to be.</p>



<p>We'll have a better understanding of how players are reacting to Highguard as the week goes on, now that the game is live. On Steam, it got off to a fairly strong start, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">reaching <strong>97K</strong> <strong>concurrent players</strong> in just its first hour on Steam alone</a>.</p>

<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Type</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Corsair</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kraken</td><td data-align="center">Pump-Action Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paladin</td><td data-align="center">Full-Auto Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Viper</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vanguard</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Big Rig</td><td data-align="center">LMG</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dynasty</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Saber Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Burst Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Longhorn</td><td data-align="center">Revolver</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ranger</td><td data-align="center">Bolt-Action Sniper</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blast Hammer</td><td data-align="center">Sledgehammer</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zipline</td><td data-align="center">Utility</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Melee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> is already executing on the first part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-january-april-2026-embark-studios/">recently revealed <strong>January to April 2026</strong> roadmap</a> for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>,</strong> with its first new update for the year, titled <strong>Headwinds</strong>, arriving to all players tomorrow, <strong>January 27, 2026,</strong> introducing a new map condition, a new Trophy Display project, and most importantly, a new <strong>Solos vs. Squads</strong> matchmaking queue option.</p>



<p>Following last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-now-live-embark-studios/">Cold Snap update</a>, the Rust Belt has thawed, and the <strong>Buried City</strong> is becoming '<strong>Bird City</strong>,' with plenty of birds flocking to the area and gathering resources in nests on high chimneys, resources that are ripe for the picking if you're able to climb to them. Bird City is the update's new map condition, with Embark warning that you'll want to have a serious look around before going for one of the nests, as you're likely to draw the attention of another Raider, waiting to catch you off guard.</p>



<p>The new matchmaking option, Solos vs. Squads, is a big update for PvP-focused players. If you feel like you could take on a full enemy squad on your own, and you're above <strong>level 40</strong>, then this new matchmaking option will let you really push your limits for a chance at higher XP and loot rewards.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The update also adds a new <strong>Trophy Display</strong> project, where you can build out your trophy case of the different ARC machines you've taken down. Lastly, the update also brings some new cosmetics, introducing the <strong>Sandwalker Set </strong>for users to grab.</p>



<p>Embark's new entry into the extraction shooter genre has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold more than <strong>12 million copies</strong> since it launched last October</a>, and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam in 2025</a>. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">currently nominated for several DICE Awards,</a> including Game of the Year. </p>

Putting players in the role of cheesemakers in the early 20th century, <em>Fromage</em> asks its players to carefully consider the cost of each action they take.</p><p>With the shape of the cheese wedges you place on the board determining when you get them back (they have to be pointing at you), <em>Fromage </em>stuck with us throughout the year, lingering like only the funkiest cheese can!</p><picture>

The team at Legends of Avantris has taken the theme of Folk Horror and explored every nook and cranny of it, creating a tense but whimsical adventure from start to finish.</p><p>The player options are vast, but are also very specific to the Folk Horror settings. You might be able to play a Harpy in a more traditional game of D&amp;D, but it might be a bit harder to get away with a Scarecrow person.</p><p>For a DM, this game sets a gold standard. From the adventure preamble and history lesson, to plenty of clear references and a way to include characters' personal stories in the adventure clearer, The Crooked Moon handles a lot of the prep for you so that you can just enjoy running the game.</p><p>If you're looking for a new adventure that allows you to take your party on a creepy adventure, where a lot of the heavy lifting is done for you then this is an excellent next adventure to play."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>First Place - Guards of Traitor's Toll</h2><p>Publisher: Grey For Now Games</p><p>From <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">Adam Potts' Original Review</a>:</p><p>"I'm a huge fan of Guards of Traitor's Toll. The token system for activation, which can be a bit random in Test of Honour (and other Warlord Games systems) when looking for a competitive battle, suits this perfectly, with the random movement capturing the feel of a bustling city perfectly. The advance and trait cards start to bring to life your constables, and the citizens themselves start to develop their own stories within your game. The Busy Streets expansion, while appearing for solo players to lock content behind a miniatures purchase, adds a lot of variety to games, and the extra citizens and guards aren't wasted. For 3 or 4-player games, Busy Streets is essential.</p><p>Guards of Traitor's Toll plays well at all player counts, and always feels natural, rather than solo rules being bolted on. Exploring the narrative through the plot and secret cards, as well as watching your guards develop and rivalries grow if playing with 2 or more players, is a true joy. It perfectly captures the feel of a skirmish and adventure game, in a living environment, where the civilians and suspects' AI control feels random and realistic."</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tr-49-review-inkle-indie-steam-pc-obra-dinn-her-story-2000662798</link>
            <guid>1416706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The latest linguistic project from <i>Heaven's Vault</i> creators Inkle is one of their best yet
                </p><div>
              
              <p><em>TR-49</em> is analogy rendered in four dimensions. On a surface level, it’s a game about sorting through an archive of written works and commentary that has you identifying dozens of excerpts and documents, all with the aim of destroying a particular work. Beneath the surface, however, this is a piece of art that speaks viciously and satirically to so much of our reality.</p>

 <p><em>TR-49</em> casts you as Abbi, a woman who must come to grips with a peculiar computer seemingly built from salvage, in order to identify and eliminate a specific piece of writing. Something is very wrong in this alternative version of the UK, however; war is raging outside, and for some reason finding a specific digitized version of a book is going to make a difference. At the beginning of the game you will have about as much understanding of how to go about locating the essential text as you might how to fly a plane. If you’ve played <a href="https://william-rous.itch.io/type-help"><em>Type Help</em></a> or perhaps <a href="https://kotaku.com/her-story-is-a-smart-murder-mystery-that-will-keep-you-1713613148"><em>Her Story</em></a> you’ll have some instincts in place, knowing to just search the database for what you can see and keep going until its disparate aspects begin to come together. You may also find yourself troubled by a strong sense that you must have missed something. You haven’t. Keep going.</p>

 <p>I’m reluctant to talk any more about what you do in this remarkable game, because all that can do is rob you of the same sense of a slowly redeemed helplessness that I was able to experience. And not just for the sake of gaming puritanism, but because that experience is so integral to so much of what the game is about. It’s safe to say that you have a visual archive of many dozens of texts (and accompanying commentary notes) to explore, and that as you go you begin matching titles to documents as well as amassing an automatically filled in collection of sublime notes that mean you can get from start to finish without ever needing to grab a pen.</p>  <p>It is far more interesting to discuss what exists beneath <em>TR-49</em>‘s mechanics, the wealth of meaning to find if you pierce the veneer. Despite its alt-history setting, depicted in an ancient, grimy stone basement, and documents primarily from the early-to-mid 20th century, this game feels incredibly, painfully relevant in 2026. This is no simple, reductive allegory, but rather an extraordinary tangle of interwoven analogy. It’s as much a piece about the existential threat posed by the mercenary consumption of human-created works being done by gen-AI as it is the immediate danger of a government that refuses to adhere to reality, although you could equally read the work as being about the complexities of constructivism, epistemology, and linguistic relativity. Heck, it’s a giant machine that eats books. Or you could just enjoy it as big, difficult puzzle.</p>

 <p>As you explore the archives you’ll learn not only about the progression of writings by a range of fictional academics and authors, but also the family and relationships of the people who built the machine you’re using and the effects the archived texts have had upon them. The game walks an incredibly fine tightrope with enormous finesse, delicately entwining magical realism into an all-too recognizable dystopian present.. It forces you to <em>think</em>. Not think about how to solve the puzzles, although of course it does, but to explore ideas you might not have considered before.</p>

 <p>I’m not going to pretend to have read about, or even have heard of, linguistic relativity and the so-called Whorf-Sapir hypothesis before playing&nbsp;<em>TR-49</em>. But as a result of playing it, and needing to discover a vocabulary to describe ideas it&nbsp; provoked, it’s where I’ve ended up. That hypothesis is the argument, if I can oversimplify it to the point where I understand it, that it is our language that determines our cognition, rather than the other way around. Is that true? Does it get dangerously close to some sort of linguistic eugenics? A magically realized view of the concept is described in the texts of the articles and publications you uncover, and weaves a whole new fiction, a sort of linguo-punk 20th century, one that critiques and speaks to the apocalyptic reality of the game’s present. And please understand it does this with no self-importance, no ostentation, instead delivering it like the hum of a machine you only realize you were hearing once it switches off.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663130"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663130">© Inkle / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an irony in the fact that <em>TR-49</em>‘s greatest weakness manifests when it attempts to impose its narrative upon you far more forcefully. Alongside reading through the texts and deciphering the codes needed to unearth more, you also have the vocal company of a man called Liam, somewhat instructing the bemused Abbi as to what she needs to do (albeit mostly by telling her that her confusion (and yours) is part of the process). After Liam speaks, a button resembling a speaker glows pink, encouraging you to click it and thus have Abbi respond. Quite why you have to constantly prompt the responses is unclear, and it quickly becomes surprisingly irritating while you’re attempting to fathom connections between texts and infer information from wonderfully subtle clues. On far too many occasions I yelled at Liam to “just shut up!” while I was trying to play, feeling obliged to deliver Abbi’s responses, having to endlessly click on the button instead of the document I’m scrolling through, all for a conversation that doesn’t really add very much.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE</p>                 <p>"Linguo-punk mastery"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>TYPE OF GAME</p>                 <p>Alt-history dystopian document discovery</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>LIKED</p>                 <p>Extraordinary world-building (and dissembling), eventual sense of feeling awfully clever, stunning music</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>DISLIKED</p>                 <p>Liam talking when I'm trying to think</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>DEVELOPER</p>                 <p>Inkle</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLATFORMS</p>                 <p>PC (played), iOS</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>RELEASE DATE</p>                 <p>Out now</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>PLAYED</p>                 <p>Completed the game in about six hours, and then checked out a second ending</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>This is no criticism of the writing and especially not of the excellent voice acting—it’s just that it’s so often so incongruous to what I’m trying to do. Liam just pipes up while I’m mid-thought, throwing me off my flow, and I began to resent him for it. There’s a moment very early on when Liam has to step away from his microphone, and Abbi panics without him but I was enjoying the peace and quiet. (It’s even more annoying that Liam’s interjections speak over the rest of the splendid voice acting of identified texts being read aloud.) It is a shame to find myself so irritated by the main characters with whom I’m supposed to relate.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663131"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663131">© Inkle / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, as I hope is obvious, this splendid game remains well worth your time. And for those who, like me, find themselves utterly overwhelmed by the likes of <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> and&nbsp;<em>Obra Dinn</em>, where the volume of information you’re asked to juggle becomes white noise to my ADHD-addled brain, I encountered none of this with&nbsp;<em>TR-49.</em> I credit this to the (I already called them “sublime” but there’s no better word) sublime automatically updated notes. They give&nbsp;nothing away, but they allow hundreds of disparate pieces of information to be calmly ordered.</p> <p>It is perhaps about time we stopped being surprised by just how brilliant each new game from Inkle is capable of being, but I’m still delighted by how different&nbsp;<em>TR-49</em> feels from, say,&nbsp;<em>Sorcery!</em>,&nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Vault</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Overboard!</em> Each game is an extraordinary demonstration of a mastery of language, and <em>TR-49</em> is no different. Except it’s very different, not least in its paranoia over the power of language, its potential dangers, and indeed the explicit dangers of its exploitation and censorship. 2026 is a chillingly perfect time to release a game about a machine that learns the atomistic contents of books, destroying them in the process.</p>

<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment went big with a year-long 2026 roadmap for Highguard. It features information on each episode and what to expect from every batch of new content: Each includes a new Warden and much more.</p>



<p>The time for talking is over as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now. Geoff Keighley bigged it up as the second coming of Apex Legends and Titanfall, and it’s not bad at all. If you think Highguard’s base-raiding action is something that’ll keep you gripped for a while, then you need the full 2026 roadmap hub bookmarked for the good times ahead.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-1-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Highguard Episode 1 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot to kill. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Highguard Episode 1 is the launch-day content. You obviously need content to get a game going, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-is-finally-getting-a-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay showcase</a> revealed the shooter’s first Wardens, maps, guns, and the rest of the glitz and glamour for opening day:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Maps</li>



<li>6 Bases</li>



<li>8 Wardens</li>



<li>3 Mounts</li>



<li>10 Weapons</li>



<li>3 Raid Tools</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-2-2026-roadmap-content-february-to-march">Highguard Episode 2 2026 Roadmap Content—February to March</h2>



<p>Following up on the launch episode is Episode 2, and this one debuts a fresh Warden, map, and Ranked Mode. Here’s the full list of content announced:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>Ranked Mode</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Raid Tool</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-3-2026-roadmap-content-april-to-may">Highguard Episode 3 2026 Roadmap Content—April to May</h2>



<p>You’re going to see a familiar theme with a lot of this content as we go. The character selection screen will become more full, and the meta will be shaken up with a new weapon:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-4-2026-roadmap-content-june-to-july">Highguard Episode 4 2026 Roadmap Content—June to July</h2>



<p>The biggest addition in Episode 4’s content (featuring the tropical months of the year!) is a new Limited-Time Mode. There aren’t many mentions of LTMs in the 2026 roadmap, so it’ll be interesting to see what the new mode is:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Limited-Time Mode</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-5-2026-roadmap-content-august-to-september">Highguard Episode 5 2026 Roadmap Content—August to September</h2>



<p>Episode 5 looks like a standard couple of months of new content. New additions to many of the Highguard’s core components await:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-6-2026-roadmap-content-october-to-november">Highguard Episode 6 2026 Roadmap Content—October to November</h2>



<p>We’re getting the word, ‘Surprise.’ Given that it falls during Episode 6 and the Halloween season, it’s reasonable to assume the community is getting special spooky surprises, events, and costume tie-ins. Will Highguard do crossovers? We’ll have to see, check out the haul:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-7-2026-roadmap-content-december">Highguard Episode 7 2026 Roadmap Content—December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big 12 months awaits. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rounding off Highguard’s first year is a rather sparse Episode 7, but more details are sure to be revealed closer to the time. A Winter-themed event and content are expected, and it carries on the tradition of a new Warden every Episode:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an element of unpredictability with a new live-service game. Highguard looks the part, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its player base.

<p>Triple H is on the cover of the Deluxe Edition of WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>2K Games announced on Twitter that Paul “Triple H” Levesque would be featured on the cover of the Deluxe Edition, dubbed the “King of Kings Edition,” for the upcoming WWE 2K26 game. </p>



<p>A two-time WWE Hall of Famer, Triple H has appeared in every WWE video game since his debut in WWF In Your House, the 1996 title released for the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.</p>



<p>Over the years, he has also been a frequent cover star, starting with WWF Attitude in 1999. Iconic games such as WWE SmackDown: Shut Your Mouth, WWE Day of Reckoning, and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 also feature “The Game” on the cover art. However, this cover is historic for the “King of Kings” because it marks the first time he has been featured solo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-is-not-the-only-cover-of-wwe-2k26-featuring-triple-h">This Is Not the Only Cover of WWE 2K26 Featuring Triple H</h2>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Era edition</a>. The cover art for that edition features many WWE legends from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Triple H was also on the cover. He was featured in the trailer alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and the other members of D-Generation X.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE also announced a Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26. </a>Triple H appears on the cover, representing WWE alongside Steve Austin, Undertaker, The Rock, Chyna, and Kurt Angle. He also appeared in the trailer for this edition, which focuses largely on the promotional rivalry between WWE and WCW that dominated the late ’90s and catapulted wrestling to a new level of popularity and success.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-will-bring-back-classic-match-types-familiar-to-longtime-triple-h-fans">WWE 2K26 Will Bring Back Classic Match Types Familiar to Longtime Triple H Fans</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As first reported by Insider Gaming,</a> WWE 2K26 is expanding its gameplay offerings with four new playable match types. The game introduces the Dumpster Match for the first time while bringing back the Inferno Match, I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. Triple H has a history of competing in all three returning gimmick matches. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> will make its return this year, featuring a completely new storyline.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any specific DLC coming to this year’s game. However, on January 24, WWE confirmed that the Monday Night War Edition will provide access to the most content.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30. However, there’s currently no set release date or price point. Recent WWE 2K games have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <guid>1416694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and at least one segment of the gaming community has already left their impressions on the game. Within an hour of its release, Highguard has received “mostly negative” reviews on Steam from players.</p>



<p>From reported performance issues to players saying they’ve been booted from the game, there seems to be a number of concerns from players. </p>







<p><strong>“Barely had 60 fps on a 5070 Ti &amp; 14700K,”</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>Another added that they <strong>“logged in immediately and got kicked out of the game.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That said, while some of the concerns appear to be valid, there are many simply joining in on the belief of many that this will be a “Concord 2” situation. For what it’s worth, Concord peaked at just 697 players on Steam while Highguard has reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 100,000 concurrent players</a> as of writing. </p>



<p>And while the reviews are mostly negative in the early stages, there are plenty of positive reviews from players. </p>



<p><strong>“The biggest takeaway after the first few matches is that the rules are really different,” </strong>one review reads. <strong>“This isn’t just a Temu Concord or [Overwatch]. The build-up, flag, and siege phases give the match a clear rhythm, and once you get used to it, it’s way more fun than pure aim duels.”</strong></p>



<p>Another user said that nothing in the game felt <strong>“messy”</strong> despite the mixing of <strong>“a lot of gameplays”.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard is out now following its high-profile showing at last month’s The Game Awards — and its developers have said a full year of post-launch content is already “deep in development.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play PvP raid shooter is live on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and PlayStation 5, with full crossplay. Development studio Wildlight is made up of former Apex Legends, Titanfall, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare staff, and promises “a new competitive structure that blends siege warfare and territory control in an evolving match where power levels escalate until only one base is left standing.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s how Highguard works, according to Wildlight:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players step into the boots of Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent where magic, gunfire, and siege warfare collide:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Teams of three select a unique base and fortify their defenses, then ride out across vast, uncharted lands to loot, harvest resources, and upgrade their gear while clashing with a rival Warden crew. </li><li>As magical storms roll in, teams battle over the Shieldbreaker, a powerful sword required to breach enemy defenses. Carrying the Shieldbreaker to the opposing base triggers a full raid — forcing teams to attack, defend, adapt, and escalate in power as the match continues.</li><li>Most of the time, victory doesn’t come with a single raid. When that happens, the enemy base shields repair, the siege tower dissipates, and the fight escalates as loot, gear, and weapons all upgrade in the field, and a new Shieldbreaker forms in a different location in the world. From there, the fight for control continues — until only one base is left standing.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Warden is built specifically for Highguard’s PvP Raid Mode. Wardens combine guns, raid tools, and arcane abilities, each designed to support raiding, destruction, defense, infiltration, resource acquisition, and open-world combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mounts allow teams to move quickly across massive maps, fight on the move, and transport the Shieldbreaker. Magical abilities supplement combat, but Highguard is still a gun game at its core. Gunplay remains central, with abilities and tools adding tactical depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, the game features a wide array of content: five large-scale maps, six distinct bases, eight Wardens, three mount types, ten weapons, three raid tools, eleven weapon and raid-tool mods, and a wide range of lootable items. More content will be added via seasonal updates.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/highguard-launch-content-1769451647066.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildlight hadn’t said a word about Highguard since its announcement at The Game Awards, opting to launch it cold. Today, now the game is out in the wild, wildlight said it was built “with long-term play in mind.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wildlight brings decades of experience operating live-service shooters at scale, applying those lessons to Highguard’s launch and beyond, with a full year of post-launch content already deep in development,” the developer said. “Highguard’s live service is built around Episodes — each lasting roughly two months and split into two parts — with new core content arriving each month throughout 2026, including content such as maps, bases, modes, Wardens, weapons, mounts, raid tools, and additional loot items.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Core gameplay content — including new maps, bases, Wardens, and modes — will always be free, delivered through regular updates, with the first wave arriving in two weeks following launch, Wildlight insisted. The studio added that all in-game purchases are cosmetic only, direct purchase only, with no effect on gameplay and no loot boxes or RNG.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/highguard-2026-roadmap-1769451620817.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Launch is a huge moment. But our team builds franchises that stand the test of time, and we’re in this for the long haul,” said Dusty Welch, co-founder and CEO of Wildlight. “Success for us is a healthy, growing global community that’s enjoying the game — and a team that’s energized by engaging with players and surprising them with new experiences over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players receive the Episode One War Chest free forever, featuring 44 items, including 11 legendary skins and emotes for Wardens, weapons, and mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know there’s a lot of eyes on us after our Game Awards trailer debut, and today is finally the time to show the world what we mean by a PvP Raid Shooter. We built Highguard around a loop that doesn’t really exist anywhere else,” commented Chad Grenier, co-founder and game director at Wildlight. “Every match is about escalation: fortifying, venturing out, clashing, then mounting coordinated raids and defenses until only one base is left standing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-riftbound-origins-cards-to-pick-up-before-spiritforged-comes-out</link>
            <guid>1416685</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Riftbound's second set, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-reveals-new-riftbound-spiritforged-cards-and-details-at-pax-unplugged">Spiritforged</a> on the horizon, the meta is about to experience a huge shake-up. We've seen this in practice already, since the set has been out in China since December 12. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They recently had their first Regional Qualifier in Fuzhou, and the new meta is slowly shaping up into a Draven-filled wasteland, but it's far from solved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still plenty of cards from the previous set, Origins, to keep an eye on as things evolve that will still be big players when the new cards come out. Spiritforged releases February 13. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Top 10 Riftbound Origins Cards to Get Before Spiritforged Is Out</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Nocturne, Horrifying</h2><div id="234682"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234682" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nocturne, Horrifying</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have been trying to make Nocturne work in decks like Teemo, Strategist and Yasuo, Unforgiven thanks to cards like Stacked Deck since the game came out. It sadly hasn't been the most consistent, but there are a few Spiritforged inclusions that could make this guy the real deal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Viktor, Innovator</h2></div><div id="234683"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234683" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viktor, Innovator</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest boogeyman of the Spiritforged meta is easily Draven, Glorious Executioner. With Spiritforged, there are a handful of great new Yellow and Blue tools to make a unitless Viktor control deck viable, and it has a decent match up into Draven. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Stacked Deck</h2></div><div id="234684"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234684" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stacked Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacked Deck has been, and will continue to be, one of the best cards in the game. It's currently sitting under $4 on TCGPlayer, so I'd recommend picking up a playset now before it goes again, especially since Purple is poised to likely warp the format around it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Fiora, Victorious</h2></div><div id="234685"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234685" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fiora, Victorious</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Legend Fiora, Grand Duelist recently placed second in the over 500-player Fuzhou Regionals in China, and Fiora, Victorious was that player's Chosen Champion. Not only does it have a good rate with its cost and Might, but it also synergizes well with the rest of the deck and helps ramp with the Legend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Salvage</h2></div><div id="234686"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234686" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Salvage</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You may already have a few Salvages in your collection since it's an uncommon and less than a buck, but with Spiritforged bringing tons of new equipment cards into the mix, gear removal is at a premium. Drawing a card is nice, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Divine Judgment</h2></div><div id="234687"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234687" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Divine Judgment</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another card that slots nicely into that unitless Viktor deck mentioned earlier, as leaving your opponent with reduced resources while you can still develop a boardstate is crucial. I can see Divine Judgment seeing more play as time goes on, especially since it continues to drop in price. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Whiteflame Protector</h2></div><div id="234688"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234688" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Whiteflame Protector</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Master Yi, Honed was the other top deck during the Origins meta, thanks in part to cards like Whiteflame Protector. With Spiritforged, Master Yi continues to put up good numbers, and our favorite shiny white dragon is no longer in the $80+ range. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sabotage</h2></div><div id="234689"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234689" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sabotage</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I've included Sabotage for the same reason as Salvage, as it may prove invaluable to remove equipment early. But Spiritforged is bringing along a host of new spells that aim to disrupt your game plan, so you should disrupt theirs first with this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Brynhir Thundersong</h2></div><div id="234690"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234690" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Brynhir Thundersong</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players got wise to how good Brynhir is a bit late during the Origins meta, but I wouldn't be shocked if people are packing one to two of this tempo-breaking card once Spiritforge drops. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Seal of Discord</h2></div><div id="234691"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234691" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seal of Discord</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no secret that, even in Origins, Purple was the best color. With the release of Spiritforged, the color gets a ton of new powerful cards the synergize well with this unassuming little gear. Cards like Ezreal, Prodigy and Called Shot take advantage of the semi-free Power cost, and some Draven lists are running the maximum number of Seal of Discord to elevate their gameplan. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Riftbound Spiritforged Products</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Click the items below to get your Riftbound Spiritforged cards from TCGPlayer, although unfortunately at a significantly inflated price compared to MSRP. You can get single booster packs, booster boxes, and the two new Champion decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"He was probably hunting for sport..."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Embark Studios is launching into new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> content when the Headwinds update brings a solo vs. squads matchmaking option, a Bird City map condition, and more to the experience tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a few social media teases and a month of waiting, Embark confirmed plans to deliver the first real content drop of 2026 with a tense teaser trailer and release date of January 27 just moments ago. The announcement has the Headwinds update set to bring a set of smaller additions to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S tomorrow, as fans wait to really get the ball rolling in February.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the next new map, new Arc threats, and major map conditions won’t arrive for a few more weeks, the January update sets Arc Raiders up for all of its future plans. Solo vs. squads matchmaking is probably the biggest addition here, with Embark describing the new queue option as a way to let the more skilled players really test their mettle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where players thus far had been pitted against squads of equal count, solo vs. squads is only available to those over level 40, allowing them to match as a solo Raider against teams of as many as three people for extra XP. Players will also benefit from quality-of-life changes with open parties, which allow players to join between matches, and expanded squad invites, which lets squadmates invite additional players directly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders players can also look forward to a rather bizarre new minor map condition for Buried City called Bird City. It’s more than a cheeky play on words, as it sees the population of topside birds swarming as they leave better loot on top of buildings. Other highlights from the Headwinds update include an Arc Trophy display, a new long-term player project, new quests, the Sandwalker cosmetic set, and what Embark describes as “a range” of gameplay updates and adjustments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Headwinds Update 'Bird City' Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Headwinds is about opening up new ways for the community to approach ARC Raiders and additional challenges for advanced players,” Embark design director Virgil Watkins said in a statement. “Between the expanded matchmaking options, new map condition and new player project, we’re excited to see how Raiders adapt and experiment — and we can’t wait to see the unexpected, funny moments and short clips the community starts creating as the update rolls out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Headwinds is the first of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026">a four-phase roadmap</a> that has content scheduled out through April 2026. Next on the docket is the Shrouded Sky update, which adds a new map condition, Arc threat, player project, map update, Raider Deck, and more sometime in February. Flashpoint will then arrive in March with another map condition and Scrappy update, with Riven Tides rounding things out with a new map and a new large Arc in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a week after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">announcing the cancelation of six games, the closure of two studios and further job losses at another three locations</a>, Ubisoft is now aiming its cost-reduction initiative at staff working inside its Paris headquarters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has proposed the loss of up to 200 jobs within the French capital, where it currently employs around 1100 people. This process will be organized under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, where staff can agree to form a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France," a Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/untitled-1-gl6tynn-1769445283880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ubisoft's Paris headquarters.

The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the RCC process has to be voluntary and has to be based on terms agreed by employees and trade unions, there's no word today on next steps if the company does not achieve the reduction in headcount it is expecting through this scheme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's Parisian offices have previously been the sight of protests against the company's previous return-to-office stipulations. Last week, Ubisoft said its company reorganization would also reintroduce five-day office work as standard (albeit with an annual pool of remote working days).

            <p>
Good, bad, I don't bloody know yet the thing's only been about for five seconds, but we can certainly say one thing now: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-the-new-fps-from-former-apex-legends-and-titanfall-devs-hits-steam-early-access-after-weeks-of-teasing-silence">Highguard is out</a>. Now we can sit and prepare ourselves for more inane and pointless discourse about yet another live service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that we've probably had several times before. Hooray! But before we get ahead of ourselves, a moment of reflection, courtesy of the devs behind Highguard itself, who have spoken out about all that silence following their Geoffies reveal.
</p>
<p>
"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better," Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch explained to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ultimately-we-could-have-made-a-different-trailer-highguard-ceo-responds-to-that-poorly-received-game-awards-reveal/">PC Gamer</a> in a new interview. "Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback. 
</p>
<p>
"I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think [The Game Awards] was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient."
</p>
<p>
Welch went on to note that Geoff Keighley is a "friend of the studio" and had played the game prior to reveal, apparently saying he'd "love to do something different and put an indie studio and a free-to-play game" up at The Game Awards. Let's pause for a moment here to highlight that the use of the word indie here feels quite disingenuous, given that Wildlight is a 100+ person studio. Independent, sure, but we all know roughly what indie means, and it's not that. You made bleedin' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, come off it!
</p><p>
Anyway, design and creative director Jason McCord also explained that the trailer at The Game Awards was just meant to be a reveal, and then they'd keep quiet. "The plan was to announce, go dark, and then the next thing that we want players to see is the game. If the reception had been totally different, it would have been the same plan. The key is, you've got to play the game." Essentially, an attempt at repeating what Apex Legends achieved on its launch.
</p>
<p>
I probably won't play it, however, as it really doesn't look to be my thing, so I'll let you lot be the ones to decide if this one gets to stay in the very empty hall of live service shooters.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-highguard-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>1416640</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard has officially been released to the public after a long month of waiting. The multiplayer FPS is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple platforms</a>, but it’s not always guaranteed that these systems can play alongside one another.</p>



<p>For an online game like Highguard, the matter of crossplay is an important one. Some fans out there will want to raid together with their friends, but if it’s platform-exclusive, that can put a serious dent in their plans.</p>







<p>If you’re unsure of what platform to download Highguard on and whether crossplay will be an issue, then read on: Insider Gaming has all the details you’ll need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-crossplay">Does Highguard Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breaking down those platform walls. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard does have Crossplay across all platforms, allowing you to team up with friends across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Gone are the days when everyone had to play games on the same platform, as it’s common courtesy that multiplayer titles offer crossplay across all platforms—or at least as many as possible. </p>



<p>Highguard is no different, and it should prove to be a great feature going forward to get as many onto the newly-released shooter as possible. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-cross-progression">Does Highguard Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Your noble steed. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, cross-progression remains unconfirmed for Highguard, meaning your progress will probably be limited to one platform. </strong></p>



<p>That makes choosing your starting platform especially important. You won’t want to unlock cosmetics and gear for your Wardens, only to lose them if you decide to play somewhere else. </p>







<p>This could easily change in the future, as it has done for plenty of other titles in the past. If you’re hoping for a cross-progression announcement for Highguard, look nowhere else than Insider Gaming, as this article will be updated as soon as anything changes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Roadmap Reveals An Entire Year of Content Plans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/</link>
            <guid>1416637</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment has officially released Highguard, a ‘new breed of shooter’, and by all accounts, it’s doing pretty well for itself. It follows a month of radio silence after the game was unveiled at The Game Awards in December. Earlier today, the team at Wildlight shared a massive, one-year-long roadmap packed with seven episodes of content.</p>



<p>The post-launch spree looks great on the surface, but time will tell if the player counts remain high enough for the delivery to matter. For now, there’s enough meat on the bones to get prospective fans very excited about what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-2026-roadmap-has-content-drops-every-month">Highguard 2026 Roadmap Has Content Drops Every Month</h2>



<p>The surprising thing about Highguard’s 2026 roadmap is that there’s a content drop planned <strong>every single month</strong>. This isn’t the most standard approach for live-service games, but Wildlight obviously has immense stock in what it has created to reveal so much, so early. We’ve got content stacked in the pipeline way up until December.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with the game’s launch, but the second episode of content will hit in just <strong>two weeks</strong>. It’ll bring a new Warden (read: hero character), a fresh map, <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, and a new mount, expanding on the bear, horse, and panther that already exist. The second part of that episode will drop in March, bringing a new <strong>base</strong> and a raid tool.</p>



<p>The difference between a map and a base? A Base is what you defend <strong>on </strong>the map, selecting it from a lineup of options when the match kicks off. This is the end zone of a match, and it’s the ultimate objective. The ‘map’ is the environment upon which you play… Simple?</p>



<p>Highguard’s roadmap expands further throughout the year.</p>



<p>There’s a new Warden coming every second month, as well as new bases, following that same launch pattern. We’ll get new maps in Highguard in June and October, and a special, limited-time mode is in the book for July. October and December yield ‘surprise’ events, and in terms of equipment, players can expect a hefty assortment to arrive as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>For instance, a new <strong>weapon </strong>will be added to Highguard in April, June, August, and October, while new <strong>amulets </strong>will appear in May, July, September, and November. Mods will be added in April, June, August, October, and December, and a new <strong>raid tool </strong>is coming in March <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p>New loot items will be published in Highguard in May and September.</p>



<p>Oh, and all the content is <strong>entirely free</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a pretty dense roadmap, but time will tell how the delivery of it fares.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/</link>
            <guid>1416631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s here, Highguard is out. The electric and innovative first-person shooter is raiding bases all over PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you plan to download the game, check out the Highguard file sizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-times-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> has gone from being the quietest and most unmarketed shooter in history to one of the most intriguing shooters of 2026. Backed by a team of world-class devs, Highguard exudes a premium vibe. You’d think it would be optimized with lower file sizes, and this would be good for all hard drives.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-playstation-5-explained">Highguard File Size On PlayStation 5, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good memory. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard only requires 20.13 GB for its initial file size on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t believe it as much as you can. A brand-new, fast-moving online shooter only requiring 20 GB at launch? It’s unheard of, and it’s magnificent. More games need to be better optimized at launch, and communities shouldn’t have to choose between certain games on limited storage space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners, get downloading, and forget about deleting games to have Highguard on your console.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-xbox-series-x-s-explained">Highguard File Size On Xbox Series X|S, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Xbox file size for Highguard is 21.09 GB, keeping in line with the PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox just can’t catch a break, can it? PlayStation is even winning in terms of Highguard optimization! Only joking, but this is more good news overall. Highguard is a supreme spectacle, and if this only requires 21 GB on a powerful Xbox Series X|S, then other games probably need to take a look in the mirror.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-pc-amp-steam-explained">Highguard File Size On PC &amp; Steam, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>PC and Steam users need a measly 20.65 GB of space to have Highguard installed.</strong></p>



<p>That’s pretty much a big tick for all three platforms. 20 GB or so is needed for Highguard at launch. Obviously, more content will be added down the line, and the initial file size will increase. For now, enjoy the first-person shooter taking up a tiny chunk of storage space.</p>



<p>Are you happy with Highaurd’s file size across major platforms? Do we need to get away from the days of 50-100 GB games sapping precious storage space? It’s mostly rhetorical, but still let the IG community know your thoughts on this through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

        <p><em>Highguard</em> introduces a new competitive structure that blends siege warfare and territory control in an evolving match where power levels escalate until only one base is left standing.</p><p>Players step into the boots of Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent where magic, gunfire, and siege warfare collide:</p><ul><li>Teams of three select a unique base and fortify their defenses, then ride out across vast, uncharted lands to loot, harvest resources, and upgrade their gear while clashing with a rival Warden crew.</li><li>As magical storms roll in, teams battle over the Shieldbreaker, a powerful sword required to breach enemy defenses. Carrying the Shieldbreaker to the opposing base triggers a full raid—forcing teams to attack, defend, adapt, and escalate in power as the match continues.</li><li>Most of the time, victory doesn’t come with a single raid. When that happens, the enemy base shields repair, the siege tower dissipates, and the fight escalates as loot, gear, and weapons all upgrade in the field, and a new Shieldbreaker forms in a different location in the world. From there, the fight for control continues—until only one base is left standing.</li></ul><p><strong>A Competitive Player-Versus-Player <a title="Companies > Experience [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Built for Variety and Replayability</strong></p><p>Each Warden is built specifically for <em>Highguard</em>‘s player-versus-player Raid Mode. Wardens combine guns, raid tools, and arcane abilities, each designed to support raiding, destruction, defense, infiltration, resource acquisition, and <a title="Genres > Open-World [817 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> combat.</p><p>Mounts allow teams to move quickly across massive maps, fight on the move, and transport the Shieldbreaker. Magical abilities supplement combat, but <em>Highguard</em> is still a gun game at its core. Gunplay remains central, with abilities and tools adding tactical depth.</p><p>At launch, the game features a wide array of content: five large-scale maps, six distinct bases, eight Wardens, three mount types, ten weapons, three raid tools, eleven weapon and raid-tool mods, and a wide range of lootable items. More content will be added via seasonal updates.</p><p><strong>Built With Long-Term Play in Mind</strong></p><p>Wildlight brings decades of experience operating live-service shooters at scale, applying those lessons to <em>Highguard</em>‘s launch and beyond, with a full year of post-launch content already deep in development. <em>Highguard</em>‘s live service is built around Episodes—each lasting roughly two months and split into two parts—with new core content arriving each month throughout 2026, including content such as maps, bases, modes, Wardens, weapons, mounts, raid tools, and additional loot items.</p><p>Core gameplay content—including new maps, bases, Wardens, and modes—will always be free, delivered through regular updates, with the first wave arriving in two weeks following launch. All in-game purchases are cosmetic only, direct purchase only, with no effect on gameplay and no loot boxes or RNG.</p></blockquote><p>Wildlight Entertainment also released numerous new trailers showcasing the game’s base, maps, characters, mounts, and weapons:</p><ul><li><strong>Base</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv3-uHACub8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellringer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-iQcI-BomY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frosthold</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3lKE6Smt1M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellmouth</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOWlhBgsSyY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King’s Lair</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQ7Gxw9jQ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smuggler’s Den</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpKjLf8y24Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wellspring</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Maps</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwWgpoT1pm4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dustline</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsbuLd0-eAc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFywphC7pp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rivermark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Rr0BE53B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH9xeEtOWjY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vesper City</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfLOhwGqTto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mounts</strong></a></li><li><strong>Wardens</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc0AzBIeZ1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atticus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4T5-PA2o5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Condor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJHSfCl7V2I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JEhCue5bAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mara</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4UpjY1cezU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redmane</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCTgcNzeOqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scarlet</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4y6mslv4OA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slade</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4uFb3S0NU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Weapons</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bza2aiBCC04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Rig</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KOJH0peiuQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blast Hammer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnPHbRvD72s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corsair</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EiS3DBN3qA&amp;pp=0gcJCXwKAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn_McWzzaRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKbO5k_Gg5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longhorn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHtjyVSK0MQ&amp;pp=0gcJCXwKAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paladin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKA2KNHBIIg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ranger</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELQ7fKYyV38" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket Launcher</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHG5mJFxVmA&amp;pp=0gcJCXwKAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saber Rifle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkWS9J0OrIQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9TQ7A-FxTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viper</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eYIoK4tanA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warden’s Axe</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwieqx5nEWQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zipline Gun</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Watch a new set of general trailers below.

The follow-up to 2023's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2023/04/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-1-upping-the-rest" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="baa061f7-68fb-43b0-a170-a578c0fe376b" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><em>Super Mario Bros.

While we don't know who voices him, it may be less consequential than who voices the other characters, as, right now, it just seems like he might make various noises with an occasional "Yoshi" thrown into his dialogue.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of Yoshi's introduction, we also got looks at Tostarena Town and the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey, the Frog Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3, Birdo from Super Mario Bros. 2, and plenty of nods from other Mario games.</p><p>You can see the trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yP5RGz_CRFM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yP5RGz_CRFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>arrives in theaters on April 1, 2026, exactly three years after the premiere of the first movie.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/yoshi-debuts-in-second-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer]]></content:encoded>
