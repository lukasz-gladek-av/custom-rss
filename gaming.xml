<p>Back on dry land</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that we first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a>'s 'In the Jungle' DLC at The Game Awards 2024. We got a brief look at the expansion in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-2026">November Xbox Showcase</a>, but today, developer MINTROCKET has fully lifted the lid on what we can expect.</p>
<p>In a new 'Dev Dive' video, the team gives us our best look yet at the upcoming DLC, which apparently adds roughly 10 hours of gameplay to the already beefy base game.</p>
<p>We get to see the jungle village of Utara, complete with its own real-time day/night cycle, where Dave can converse with the locals, freely dive into the freshwater lake, and gather resources. It still feels a bit strange to see Dave move in a 3D plane, but the whole thing looks really rather sweet. This locale is also home to Bancho's Grill, a new restaurant to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a closer look at Dave's new diving spot, and his fresh transforming 'Jungle Gun' weapon to fend off the beasties therein.</p>

<p>It promises to be quite the expansion when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 at some point next year. MINTROCKET still hasn't shared a precise date, but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more information.</p>

		<p>Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Latest In the Jungle DLC News, 2025 Recaps &amp; More! | DEV DIVE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5_pWDFRca0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill.</p>
<p>When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a><em>, </em>you're about to learn something today. One way to describe it is one of 2024's best indie games. Another is to say it's this amazing, somewhat niche, experimental, and ominously beautiful first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer/games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">platformer</a> that takes place within a mysterious megastructure. It even has a brand-new DLC with <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>.</p><p>The main game is inspired by my favorite manga author, Tsutomi Nihei, who is a master of his craft. He puts his architecture background to incredible use and illustrates these haunting, gigantic structures filled with unfathomable secrets.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Lorn's Lure</em> already took some inspiration from Nihei, I was very intrigued to try out one particular map in this collection, called "Blame." It's the name of Nihei's most famous work, <em>Blame!</em>, so I knew this was going to be something special to me. Besides that, we have four other maps with a central "parkour" theme that are sure to keep your attention for a good few hours.</p><p>With five different maps offering five different experiences, I'm going to go against the grain and rate every level on its own merits with a handful of "mini-reviews" with their own number ratings, then we'll average those numbers up and see what we get for the whole package.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The<em> Blame!</em> vibes are strong here.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Blame is the closest we get to an additional <em>Lorn's Lure</em> chapter. It's roughly the same length as a story chapter and focuses on exploration rather than speed. Mechanically, players are given just a few upgrades, so you don't have a double-jump or grapple at your disposal. This one is purely about the vibes, and that's what made me fall in love with <em>Lorn's Lure</em> in the first place.</p><p>Elements from the <em>Blame! </em>manga are perhaps more overt here than any other chapter, with concrete, drab megastructures looming in the distance, leading into areas with unknown technology, pipes (Nihei loves to draw his intricate network of pipes, after all), and castle-like buttresses and towers.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Please admire my video game photography skills.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This would make an excellent addition to the story of <em>Lorn's Lure</em> were it not a part of the <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack. </em>While it's not the most difficult or intense chapter, it does what <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does best, instilling a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the world compared to tiny ol' you.</p><p>Final Verdict: 9/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Nothing else to do but jump.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Fall</h2><p>Fall is a quick, intense experience in <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>. You're descending a giant pit, all the way to the bottom. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> mechanics dictate that falling too fast will result in your death as soon as you hit the ground, so the name of the game here is to take a measured approach.</p><p>You're equipped with a grapple, so Fall becomes quite an exciting experience when you're able to utilize this tool. The physics for the grapple are fantastic, so you end up feeling like Spider-Man, trying his best not to fall too hard while also rushing to the finish to get a high score.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Make use of that grapple, or you're cooked.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is one of the shortest maps in the pack, but there's a decent variety of obstacles given that it's a completely vertical map. It can also be a bit challenging, even for someone like me who likes to take things safe, slow, and steady.</p><p>Final Verdict: 7.5/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sheesh, where to even begin when you only have a single checkpoint to start?</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - ProcGenV1</h2><p>ProcGenV1 is a very experimental map in this collection, but definitely one of the highlights of <em>Parkour Pack</em>'s offerings. As the name implies, it's a procedurally generated experience. There are, in essence, unlimited possibilities in ProcGenV1, as it creates a large environment of megastructures to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this map is to find the "extraction hut," which finishes the level. The environment is filled with various other huts high and low, and most have an arrow pointing to the actual extraction hut. Huts have items that players can use at their disposal to aid in their adventure, adding a nice twist on the simplistic platforming of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p><p>Items include a stamina boost, boots to increase your jumping abilities, a one-time use grapple (refillable if you find more), and a checkpoint USB. In the main game of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>, checkpoints are aplenty, but with them being so scarce in ProcGenV1, you're encouraged to be methodical and only take risks when it's absolutely necessary.</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorn-s-lure-parkour-map-pack-arrow.jpg?itok=xJgXF3o- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The arrow is just vague enough to still be challenging, especially when a level is as big as this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just amazed by the complexity of environments created in ProcGenV1. They are a little drab in appearance, but as I understand it, Rubeki Games will update this with new features every once in a while. I see a great deal of potential in ProcGenV1 evolving into something amazing; for now, it could use more variation in appearance and perhaps more items.</p><p>There's also a really pesky mechanic where some items are poisoned, and that decreases your stamina by a large amount for several minutes. Because of the way these levels are generated, you usually never have enough stamina to go anywhere when it's so low, so I usually waited it out until the poison debuff was removed.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 8.5/10</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The closest I'll ever get to doing parkour in my life is through <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Rubeki's Pro Traceur</h2><p>Rubeki's Pro Traceur is a beautiful parkour-based map that replaces <em>Lorn's Lure</em>'s megastructures with a small urban environment. Resembling that of a European city, this map touts itself as a "parkour sandbox."&nbsp;</p><p>The main objective of this map is to gather all the crystals. It seems to take inspiration from <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> in particular, with its Delfino Plaza-esque visuals and vibes. Your objective is to gather all the crystals on this map, of which there are 25.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>What a nice view!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Buildings are close together to create narrow alleys to bounce around on. Crystals at the top of the building are quite difficult to reach, especially when you're stripped of your usual climbing tools. I ran into an issue where I was given the option to pick up climbing tools right from the start, but I don't think that was intentional since it largely strips the map of any sort of difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Rubeki's Pro Traceur is fine for what it is. It's short and doesn't try to be anything but a little sandbox to give players the ability to flex their platforming skills. It's far from the slower, exploration-based platforming that I prefer, but it's still worth one play.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 7/10</p><figure role="group">
<picture>

  </picture>
<figcaption>Gotta go fast, but also, I'm too scared to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Sonic</h2><p>The idea behind Sonic is to create a high-speed obstacle course for players, with devastating consequences for failure. It's a somewhat linear track that hangs high above in a megastructure, so if you fall, you're going right back to the start. The twist here is that you're given super speed, so it's actually very challenging to deal with this newfound mobility.</p><p>You don't have any tools at your disposal other than this speed. Unfortunately, there was one obstacle near the start that, try as I might, I couldn't find how to overcome. I didn't get a real chance to experience this one, so I'll just admit defeat and say this level wasn't for me (especially since I prefer the slower, methodical gameplay as opposed to speed). While I won't give it a final score since I didn't complete it, I know this one isn't for me.</p><p>Final Verdict: N/A</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>While Blame and ProcGenV1 are the main appeal here, there's something for fans of speedier gameplay in Sonic, Rubeki's Pro Traceur, and Fall. All-in-all, it's a nice little package to give fans more <em>Lorn's Lure</em> content, but what I'm <em>especially</em> interested in is seeing how ProcGenV1 develops in the future.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have been enjoying a surge in popularity over the last few years. The Steam Deck was the device that truly opened the floodgates, proving that a near-full PC gaming experience could be packed into a portable form. Not long after, other handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally started popping up, giving players even more options. These systems are undeniably convenient and surprisingly powerful for their size, and there’s a certain appeal to curling up on the couch and launching full PC titles without dragging out a bulky laptop.</p>
<p>That said, handheld gaming PCs still come with a fairly narrow focus. They’re designed for gaming, and can’t do anything else. If you need a machine that can handle your workload, web browsing, content consumption, and gaming all in one package, a traditional gaming laptop remains the more practical choice. At the moment, Amazon is offering a particularly strong deal on the Asus TUF F16, making it worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Normally priced around $1,000, the 2024 laptop is currently discounted to $800, representing a substantial $200 price cut.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This configuration of the TUF F16 is powered by an Intel Core 5 210H processor paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 4050 laptop GPU and 8GB of RAM. If you want something a bit better than that, the 2025 model is also on sale. That one comes with and Intel Core i5 13450HX processor and the NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU with16GB of RAM. This one is $300 off, bringing the price down from $1,300 to just an even $1,000. Either comes with a 512GB SSD to for all your storage needs.</p>
<h2>Gaming Performance</h2>
<p>While the Asus TUF Gaming F16 is not a top-tier powerhouse built to max out every new AAA release, it offers very respectable performance for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and many larger games should perform smoothly at medium settings without major compromises.</p>



<p>The Asus TUF F16 features a 16-inch display with a taller 16:10 aspect ratio. It runs at Full HD resolution and supports a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, making it well suited for fast-paced games and competitive play. Adaptive-Sync technology works to reduce screen tearing and stuttering for a more fluid experience. Slim bezels surround the display, giving you more usable screen real estate without making the laptop feel overly large or cumbersome.</p>
<p>In terms of design, Asus keeps things relatively understated. The keyboard is full-size and includes a dedicated number pad, something that has become less common on modern laptops. The gold-accented WASD keys add a touch of personality without pushing the system into flashy, over-the-top territory.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Asus TUF F16 holds its own. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, allowing it to reach 50% capacity in roughly 30 minutes. There’s also a 100W USB-C port for charging phones or accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Overall, at just $800, the Asus TUF F16 delivers strong value. It’s a capable gaming hub that can easily handle your basic, everyday laptop needs.</a></p>

    <p><span>10-hour-long expansion due out in early 2026.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > MINTROCKET [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nexon/mintrocket">MINTROCKET</a> has released a new “Developer Dive” video for <em><a title="Games > DAVE THE DIVER [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dave-the-diver">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em>, reflecting on 2025 and sharing studio updates, including a deep dive of information on the downloadable content “In the Jungle,” which is due out in early 2026. <span id="more-1016477"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Downloadable Content “In the Jungle”</strong></p><p>Following the gameplay sneak peek as part of November’s <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Partner Preview, Mintrocket reveals that the next downloadable content—the largest story expansion yet—will launch with approximately 10 hours of content. Much of this new <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> introduces fresh, surprising mechanics and systems that branch boldly away from the base game and previous downloadable contents.</p><p>In “In the Jungle,” Dave heads into freshwater as he embraces new responsibilities and challenges, including befriending the locals of his and a friend’s new home base: a quaint jungle village brimming with opportunity… and just a splash of danger.</p><p><strong>The Village</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to Utara, a jungle village where time flows in real-time. Here, Dave can spend his days freely diving underwater, gathering fruits and resources—and, naturally, building relationships with the locals by completing tasks and side quests.</p><p>As ever, Dave finds himself surrounded by potential friends (and future customers) whose trust and patronage must be earned. As relationships deepen, so too do the rewards, unlocking new opportunities throughout Utara and creating ripple effects that extend all the way to Bancho’s restaurant business.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The Restaurant</strong></p><p>One of “In the Jungle’s” biggest departures from the base game is the introduction of Bancho Grill, a brand-new restaurant in Utara featuring a fully cooked freshwater menu.</p><p>Unlike Bancho Sushi, where movement was limited, Dave can now move freely throughout the Grill, serving customers across multiple areas rather than a single horizontal plane. As Dave’s bonds with villagers grow, they’ll begin visiting Bancho Grill as diners, making the restaurant a key hub, and a vital link, between Dave and the village community.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Systems and Mechanics</strong></p><p>This time around, Dave dives into a massive freshwater lake instead of the Blue Hole—one packed with new aquatic life, unexpected cuisine options, and plenty of lurking danger. New waters demand new tools, and Mintrocket revealed Dave’s latest piece of gear: the Jungle Gun. This versatile weapon can freely transform into net guns, shotguns, snipers, or regular guns, allowing Dave to adapt on the fly and giving players the freedom to experiment with their preferred combat styles.</p><p>Combined with a shift from fully horizontal movement to a more free-flowing isometric view, along with real-time progression, Dave will need to carefully balance priorities and make smarter use of space and time. Expect new minigames with friends, jungle-specific adventures, and a wide variety of activities that benefit Bancho Grill, or Utara as a whole.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■&nbsp;<em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> <a title="Platforms > Mobile [3,087 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/mobile">Mobile</a></strong></p><p>Rounding out today’s Dev Dive, Mintrocket also revealed plans to complete Dave’s multi-platform expedition by bringing the game to mobile platforms together with a partner. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> on mobile won’t be a simple port—instead, the game will be fully optimized and redesigned to perform seamlessly on mobile.

Arkansas State was up 31-7 going into the fourth, but Missouri State battled back, scoring 21 points in the fourth to make it close.</p><p>Naturally, the Xbox Bowl was full of Xbox-branded partnerships, including Master Chief doing the coin toss to start the game. Corey Rucker Jr. of Arkansas State won Offensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, earning himself an <a href="https://x.com/ESPNCFB/status/2001894073200701877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Achievement Unlocked"</a> trophy, while Kyle Taylor of Arkansas State won Defensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, taking home a similarly styled trophy.</p><p>As for the actual trophy for the champions, Master Chief was driven to midfield in a Warthog to present Arkansas State with the trophy, which took the form of an Rog Xbox Ally strapped onto a football-shaped piece of metal with the Xbox logo on it.</p><p>Both teams also received Xbox systems in the form of the Rog Xbox Ally handheld, and you can see in the video below that players from Missouri State were pretty stoked.</p><p>The popular College Football Campus Tour, which documents obstructed views at stadiums, even reported back from the Xbox Bowl, which was held at The Ford Center in Frisco, Texas. Section 204 Row 16 and Seat 23 had only 36% field visibility, which is pretty rough, as you can tell from the image below.</p><p>Check out some additional images from the Xbox Bowl below, as shared on social media.</p>

            <p>Ever since lead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette went on the record as saying "we definitely cut some sex scenes"</a> and teased that we may "get to see those one day", the game's fanbase has held its breath in bated anticipation. But it's not happening.</p>
<p>I spoke to Shorette and Dispatch game director Nick Herman recently and they told me that while there were once plans for a sex scene involving your chosen love interest in the game, the actual scenes themselves "never tangibly existed". As in, there's nothing to reinstate.</p>
<p>"Let's curb this here, Pierre," said Herman.</p>
<p>Shorette nodded as if in agreement, then said: "The reality is we're definitely going to put those sex scenes in."</p>
<p>"God damnit," said Herman in response.</p>
<p>Shorette laughed; if it wasn't clear, that was a joke.</p>

<p>The duo explained that the problem arose when people found code in Dispatch for an event the team didn't build out. "They could see that we had booleans for 'if someone was going to spend the night' or 'which love interest was going to spend the night'," Herman said. The love interests in the game being Blonde Blazer and Invisigal.</p><p>Shorette continued: "So after the party, that was the point in the story where that would happen." The party occurs in Episode 6, so relatively near the end of the eight-episode season, and it's a wonderful scene - one of my favourites in the game.</p>
<p>It raises the question of why the studio decided against developing the sex scenes any further, and the answer is much simpler than you might think: "Money," Herman and Shorette said almost at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>"It was just money," Herman went on. "That whole scene was like double or triple the length; the whole party was almost an entire episode at Robert's apartment. And scoping: we probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game. It was a lot of writing that had to get cut to be condensed down into something that we could produce.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game"</em></blockquote>
<p>"So just to say it: those scenes were never storyboarded. They didn't go into animation. So people say 'release them': they never tangibly existed."</p>
<p>"Everything that got made, shipped," Shorette added. "We wanted to put it in, we just ran out of money is what it really came down to. So you can blame the video game industry, not us. If people believed in us, we could have made it."</p>

<p>Shorette was referring to the several years of rejection Dispatch faced as AdHoc pitched the game to publishers and tried to get it to release - a twisting, turning saga I've written about in more detail in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a>. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">the game is a big success, having sold 2m copies and counting</a>.</p><p>A limited budget meant Dispatch also couldn't deliver the breadth of choice some players wanted as far as romance options were concerned. You can't, for example, pursue a romance with any of the characters in the Z-team you lead, which is probably a good thing as far as HR is concerned.</p>
<p>It was while talking about a possible sequel and the expectations players will have for it, and for the characters in it, that Shorette said: "And want to have sex with."</p>
<p>"Good lord," said Herman again in response.</p>
<p>"We should put out a-" Shorette said, before being interrupted by Herman, who added: "-place where everyone can just have sex with everyone."</p>
<p>Shorette continued: "We'll make a Date Everything. But it has to be non-canon because it's so messy - that's the problem. You can't have a Date Everything because we have to take those seriously as relationships, not just treat this as like some fuck party.</p><p>"When you look at the relationships that we had, they're very specific and important to the story in terms of the type of characters they are. Robert is a guy that on the one hand has it together and can be supportive to someone like [Invisigal], but then also needs fucking help, you know? Which is perfect for Blazer.</p>
<p>"Malevola," he added, referencing the tall and muscled red demon woman who wears a tight top and tight denim shorts: "if we threw Malevola in there, everyone would just fuck Malevola. Demon Cindy Crawford. Muscle Mommy. It would be easy mode."</p>
<p>The success and general applause for Dispatch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">former Witcher 3 developer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz said Dispatch was his game of the year</a> - have meant people are now clamouring for a second season of the game. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">it sounds very much like a Dispatch Season 2 will happen</a>. However, with success comes expectation and, as Shorette said, "A lot of pressure. It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>

		<p>Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified.</p>

              <p>Need an additional Xbox controller? It’s always a good idea to have an extra in case you want to play with a friend or have one on reserve if you run out of battery. We’ve found one that you can grab right now for a great price, this close to the holidays.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller is built for players who want more control, comfort, and customization from their gaming sessions. It feels great in your hands, with textured grips and a balanced design that helps you stay comfortable even during long play sessions. No matter what kind of games you like to play, you’ll find this model comfortable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardcore Xbox controller that’ll soon become your main</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller right now for just $110, down from its usual price of $150.</a> That is a discount of $40 and 27% off. This is a top of the line controller for the Xbox, so you’re getting a pretty decent price here, considering you’ll usually pay nearly $50 more.</p>
<p>Right out of the box the Elite Series 2 Core feels like an upgrade from a standard controller. The thumbsticks are responsive, the buttons click with just the right amount of feedback, and the overall feel is one of quality. It connects wirelessly to your Xbox or Windows PC, so you can enjoy gaming without cords getting in your way. The Bluetooth support also means you can pair it with other compatible devices for more flexibility.</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of this controller is how customizable it is. You can change stick sensitivity, remap buttons, and fine tune settings to match your personal play style. Normally, core Xbox controllers aren’t so easy or versatile when it comes to personalization, so you get a lot more options here to work with. That’s especially useful if you like to change things for shooters or even fighting games to better fit the way you play.</p>
<p>The Elite Series 2 Core also includes additional components you can swap in and out. Different thumbsticks and paddle options let you tweak the feel and response of the controller, so you can tailor it to different genres.</p>
<p>With a solid mix of premium build quality, customization options, and wireless convenience, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller stands out among controllers in its class. For this price, you should go ahead and snatch one up before they raise in price again. Everything gaming-related seems to be getting a price hike, after all.</p>

            <p>Larian hope to offer "more insight" into their usage of generative AI via an ask me anything session set to take place in the new year. It'll also be a chance to ask more general questions about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>, if you fancy. Naturally, this all comes after the Geoff announcement of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devs' next RPG was swiftly followed by comments from CEO Swen Vincke which revealed the studio are making limited use of generative AI.</p>

<p>In a second response to backlash against his assertions regarding Larian's use of genAI "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text" - you can get the full context in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">our</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally">other</a> recent pieces - the CEO's announced that the studio'll be hosting an ask me anything chat in the new year. Arguing that "a lot has become lost in translation" following Divinity's announcement, Vincke wrote that this back-and-forth is aimed at offering "the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly".</p>
<p>While he put a pin in revealing a concrete date for the chat for now, writing that one'll be forthcoming once the calendar flips over to 2026, the CEO did take this opportunity to offer a bit more of his view on the subject "Larian’s DNA is agency," he wrote.

<p>To be fair to Vincke and co, you can't accuse them of simply burying their heads and going quiet as the backlash has swirled.

              <p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. This is the time of the year when radio stations start playing holiday-themed music nonstop and commercials are filled with festive tunes. But not all Christmas music is good. In fact, I’d say at least 80 percent of holiday jingles are old, boring, and terrible.</p> <p>However, I won’t toss all Christmas music under the bus; some holiday tunes have a way of making you feel the warmth and merriment of the season. With that in mind, here are the 15 best tracks to play this year if you want to get into the festive spirit but don’t want to listen to boring old crap. Christmastime is a fun time of year, when people should be feeling good and enjoying time off and the company of loved ones. Or at least getting cool presents. Why ruin that with some slow, sad song from the 1930s?</p>

 <p>So here are some good, fun tracks that range from newer hits to oldies that won’t make you fall asleep. And if you work in retail, I am so sorry that you have to spend, like, five weeks listening to all of these and more over and over again, and you all deserve huge bonuses for that torture.</p> <p>Oh and let us know what your favorite Christmas songs are in the comments below. I’ll be waiting for someone to share <em>Grandma Got Ran Over by a Reindeer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Father Christmas – The Kinks</h2>  <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town – Bruce Springsteen</h2>  <h2>Linus And Lucy – Vince Guaraldi</h2>  <h2>Last Christmas – Wham!</h2>  <h2>Run, Rudolph, Run! – Chuck Berry</h2>  <h2>Feliz Navidad – José Feliciano</h2>  <h2>All I Want For Christmas Is You – Mariah Carey</h2>  <h2>Christmas Wrapping – The Waitresses</h2>  <h2>Christmas (Baby Please Come Home!) – Darlene Love</h2>  <h2>You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&nbsp;– Thurl Ravenscroft</h2>  <h2>Holly Jolly Christmas – Burl Ives</h2>  <h2>Santa Baby – Eartha Kitt</h2>  <h2>Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree – Brenda Lee</h2>  <h2>Underneath The Tree – Kelly Clarkson</h2>  <h2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – The Jackson 5</h2>

<p>NVIDIA is offering a free GPU to the best Fortnite players in the world during an upcoming tournament in the game, amid the growing shortage of the gear.</p>



<p>The price of GPU and RAM has skyrocketed in recent months amid growing shortages, driven by the increased use of AI, pricing many out of the components. However, the door has been opened for a limited number of players to claim an NVIDIA GPU in Fortnite.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-gpu-available-in-fortnite-tournament">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU Available in Fortnite Tournament</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Earnable. Image via NVIDIA</figcaption></figure>



<p>On December 21 and 22nd, with the precise date depending on your region, Fortnite is hosting the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/events/s39_nvidia?lang=en-US&amp;region=NAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cup</a>, a solo tournament where players can face off to secure grand prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for the “top competitors.”</p>



<p>While earning the GPU requires being one of the best Fortnite players in your region, the shortage and growing price of components makes playing in the Fortnite tournament potentially an easier option than splashing out on the market.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU starts at $999.99 on the NVIDIA website, with prices on the secondary market being even higher.</p>



<p>Participation in the tournament also opens the door to earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-fortnite-cosmetic-finally-returns-after-seven-year-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare cosmetic that has not been available in Fortnite for seven years</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling</a>, which will be distributed to all players who earn at least eight points during the tournament.</p>



<p>There are restrictions to competing, however, as players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments in the past 180 days to be eligible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is packed with Terminator references and Easter eggs, but this one is perhaps for hardcore fans only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bitmap Bureau’s retro action game has an Easter egg that can only be accessed once you’ve unlocked its hardest mode, Judgment Day. Once you’ve done that, play through the game on Judgment Day difficulty and reach the Biker Bar level, which is only the second level in Arcade Mode if you want to get there quickly. The instant the level loads, you’ll immediately notice that the previously naked Arnie is now wearing some very bright, ultra ‘90s neon Zubaz shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is he doing that? It’s a reference to how The Governator actually dressed on-set during the filming of the biker bar scene in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That’s right: naked Arnie in Terminator 2 is a lie, and you can get a glimpse of those incredibly colourful shorts in this footage from behind the scenes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought we’d check in with the Terminator 2D development team to find out more about this cheeky Easter egg, and they explained how it came together:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When planning the game we did a lot of research on the movie; watching it scene-by-scene, going through materials such as the illustrated screenplay and also looking at making of content which is where the shorts idea came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After looking at how some of the older T2 games handled the naked Terminator for the bar scene (for example in the SNES game where it was behind a strategically placed wooden fence) — Mike [Tucker, designer] jokingly had the idea of making a pixelated crotch effect for Easy Money mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we decided the shorts from behind-the-scenes pics would be a hilarious Easter egg and you can only unlock it on the Judgment Day difficulty!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/gettyimages-1203004089-1766144042028.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ohhh, that's a bad idea, fella! Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also had an internal thread where we gathered ideas for Easter eggs to include, and we managed to fit plenty of them into the game. For example, retro game lovers may enjoy the custom ending of Arcade Mode which we hope is a nice reward for sticking with that challenge and completing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the biker bar level itself, we made a lot of adjustments throughout the development as we continued to polish. Like adding the two licensed music tracks, adding the boss fight, the guy getting griddled, giving the Terminator a line asking for clothes, boots and motorcycle, the waitress idle animations etc and then we added a few more moves such as the backfist, headbutt, and shoulder barge for depth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it! That’s why the Terminator is wearing retro shorts in Terminator 2D: No Fate, and if you didn’t already know about its origins, now you have some fun movie trivia to impress your film buff friends with!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Terminator Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arnie's shorts aren't the only call-back to Terminator 2. In June, IGN reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/maker-of-new-terminator-2-video-game-tracked-down-actor-who-played-future-war-john-connor-back-in-1991-to-include-his-likeness"><u>how the developers tracked down the actor who played future war John Connor back in 1991 to include his likeness</u></a>, and in doing so found out why Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-review">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Terminator 2D: No Fate is a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made, punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in Terminator movie news, creator James Cameron has said he plans to make a new film once the dust has settled on Avatar: Fire and Ash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-safely-say-he-wont-be-in-it-james-cameron-says-arnold-schwarzeneggers-time-as-the-terminator-is-officially-over-as-he-plots-new-movie">but insisted Arnold Schwarzenegger's time as The Terminator is officially over</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

    <p><span>Ye Shunguang's debut, enhanced optimizations, and additional rewards.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “To Be Fuel for the Night,” will launch on December 30, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1016391"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The major update propels Proxies into the culminating chapter of Season 2, introducing the upcoming Void Hunter Ye Shunguang, the popular Zhao, a series of highly anticipated events—including expanded Hollow gameplay and multiplayer combat—and extensive optimizations. To celebrate the new year and express gratitude for the Proxies’ support, Version 2.5 will also grant Proxies a free S-Rank Agent Zhao, 1,000 Polychromes, a new outfit for Jane, and additional rewards.</p><p>Ye Shunguang, the young senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, rises as the first dual-form Void Hunter. With her unique attribute Honed Edge, Ye Shunguang can enter the Enlightened Mind state and activate her signature Ether Veil to unleash massive Honed Edge damage while applying a vulnerability effect to enemies. Accompanying Ye Shunguang is her sidekick Bangboo Sprout, who peppers enemies with volleys of flying swords. Joining them is the unbeaten legend of Krampus, Zhao, who is an S-Rank Ice Defense Agent. Despite her adorable appearance, Zhao weaves swiftly across the battlefield and launches assaults with her massive weapon to suppress enemies. By accumulating Frostbite, Zhao can trigger Ether Veil: Wellspring, granting powerful buffs for the entire squad.</p><p>With strengthened allies, the new chapter unveils the final moments of Waifei Peninsula’s escalating crisis. The legendary Qingming Sword has begun to resonate with the primordial power of the Creator—an overwhelming force that assisted Proxies in past battles but now threatens a profound backlash for Ye Shunguang. Meanwhile, mysterious white flowers—once found only within the Hollows—have begun blooming across Failume Heights, signaling the dangerous expansion of the Lemnian Hollow. Proxies shall venture deep into the Lumite Mine ruins, using their new Perception Technique and teaming up with allies to uncover the truths hidden within the Hollow’s depths.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1016393"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The adventure continues in the epilogue Sword Seeker Chronicles as Proxies support Ye Shunguang in seeking a remedy for the Qingming Sword’s backlash. The investigation showcases Ye Shunguang’s Bladeflash Mirage ability and offers exclusive rewards, including a brand-new W-Engine. Multiplayer combat arrives in the limited-time event Joint Investigation: The Divine Maze, where three-member squads face fast-paced cooperative challenges that reward coordination and tactical timing. Outside combat, the newly added Proxy Outpost allows Proxies to join or create outposts, facilitate discussions, and post or accept commissions, making New Eridu more connected than ever.</p><p>Version 2.5 also introduces quality-of-life updates that refine combat and progression. The existing Agents Soldier 11, Grace, Soldier 0 – Anby, Ellen, and Burnice will be enhanced with updated mechanics and performance boosts, with additional agents in the standard Stable Channel scheduled for future enhancements. Meanwhile, improvements to Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault further polish the gameplay loop, while the new sweep function for Combat Simulation stages lets players consume Ether Batteries to instantly gather promotion materials and Drive Discs, easing the burden of day-to-day progression.</p><p>To welcome both new and returning Proxies, all players can jump directly into Version 2.5’s story through Advance Screening, while expanding their squads with a lineup of limited-time channels. The channels for Ye Shunguang and Zhao will run throughout the entire version, and a special rerun channel in the latter half guarantees the first S-Rank signal obtained will be a selected character among Alice, Soldier 0 – Anby, or Astra, along with their signature W-Engines returning with the same guarantee mechanic.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.5 special program below.

            <p>The oft-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> is now being planned for a release in several years time, with the latest date simply being "2028".</p>
<p>Ark 2 was announced all the way back in 2020, with a rather unexpected trailer featuring Vin Diesel of The Fast and The Furious fame. So, five years later, and we still don't have a firmer release date beyond that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">newly-announced 2028 window</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, developer Studio Wildcard said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Ark 2 had been delayed until the "end of 2024"</a>, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">once been planned for a 2023 release</a>. It has kept pretty quiet on any actual release date at all since then, though.</p>
<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-scene-setter-and-anime-crossover-expansion-comes-to-ark-survival-ascended-this-december">the upcoming sequel didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier in the year</a>, which led many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. They were right!</p>
<p>As well as starring in Ark 2, Diesel is also serving as the executive producer on the project, bringing his game development skills to the test. Previous reports said that Diesel has played over 1,000 hours of the original game. Also, did you know his real name is actually Mark Sinclair?!</p>
<p>"Survive the past. Tame the future," reads Ark 2's official blurb. "Suddenly awakened on a primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance, you must team-up with legendary heroes to confront powerful dark forces.</p>
<p>"Saddle up, and join the definitive next-gen survival experience with Ark 2!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ark-related news, back in the summer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for Survival Evolved came under fire after it released a trailer that was clearly made using AI</a>. The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured footage such as a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amazon MGM’s live-action <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider</a> show has signed up another Hollywood star with Jason Isaacs joining the cast in an undisclosed role. Given that he is English he could be playing Lara’s father or more likely, the bad guy. Isaacs was recently seen – quite explicitly – in The White Lotus where he played Timothy Ratliff. He has also voiced one of the villains in <a title="Baldur's Gate 3" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></p>
<p>He will be joining Sigourney Weaver who has confirmed herself that she will also be in the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be writing and executive producing the series. Lara herself will be played by Sophie Turner.</p>


<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>
<p>Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-hits-a-record-low-with-nearly-1000-off-in-a-year-end-clearance-deal-2000654703</link>

              <p>Some gaming monitors get touted as being “ultra-wide” but this one really earns that namesake. The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor stretches an intimidating 57″ across. If you’re in the market for a monitor that is just one step shy of spanning 360 degrees around you’re head while you play, well, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">Amazon has the Samsung monitor listed right now for a staggering $850 off. That brings it to $1,450—about 37% off its original price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="826">Performance That Extends Beyond Your Field of View</h2>
<p data-start="828" data-end="1339">Samsung proudly markets the Odyssey Neo G9 as the world’s first dual UHD gaming monitor. The screen is essentially the equivalent of two 32-inch 4K displays fused side by side, creating an ultra-wide canvas that delivers incredible clarity across an almost unfathomably wide viewing area. Thanks to Quantum Mini-LED technology paired with HDR 1000 support, the monitor reaches stunning levels of brightness, contrast, and color accuracy that make games and visuals feel strikingly lifelike.</p>
<p data-start="1341" data-end="1683">Speed is just as impressive as image quality. With an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate and full support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, the Odyssey Neo G9 minimizes screen tearing, stuttering, and frame drops. As long as your gaming PC has the horsepower to keep up, you can expect fluid motion and responsive gameplay across the entire display.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="2071">The screen’s aggressive 1000R curvature is designed to match the natural curvature of the human eye, making the monitor feel as though it’s wrapping around you. When positioned at the proper viewing distance, the display stretches from the far edges of your left peripheral vision all the way across to the right, creating an incredibly immersive experience that few monitors can rival.</p>


<p data-start="2073" data-end="2353">For connectivity, Samsung includes the latest DisplayPort 2.1, ensuring access to the some of the highest bandwidth and best performance available today. The monitor also supports HDMI 2.1 and features a USB-C hub, giving you plenty of options for connecting PCs, consoles, and other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2355" data-end="2742">Because of its immense width, the Odyssey Neo G9 excels at multitasking. Picture-by-picture mode allows you to display content from two different input sources simultaneously at their native resolutions. Samsung’s Auto Source Switch+ further can automatically detect newly powered-on devices and switching to the correct input without requiring any manual adjustments.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3034">On the back of the monitor, CoreSync and Core Lighting+ add some extra flair by matching ambient RGB lighting to the colors displayed on screen. If the ultra-wide monitor doesn’t capture you’re entire vision, the area around it will be illuminated to feel as though the screen extends even further than the absurd lengths it already does.</p>
<p data-start="3036" data-end="3400" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The monitor sits on a highly flexible, ergonomic stand that supports swivel, tilt, and height adjustments. It’s easy to dial in the perfect viewing position for any desk or user.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Next ARC Raiders Map Condition Named ‘Toxic Swamp’, Data Suggests]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-map-condition-named-toxic-swamp/</link>
            <guid>1388107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players are busy exploring every inch of the new Cold Snap update, which introduced the Flickering Flames event and maps blanketed in snow and harsh conditions. However, thanks to a clever trick, some are poring over what’s coming next to ARC Raiders, including a new map condition called ‘Toxic Swamp’.</p>



<p>We’ve taken a look at what’s coming in ARC Raiders, including the next few weeks of Trials and this mysterious map condition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-calendar">How to Check ARC Raiders’ Calendar</h2>



<p>If you want to see what’s coming next in ARC Raiders, you’ll need to be on PC. Simply boot the game, alter your system’s date to reflect one in the future, and you’ll see the game update to reference future events.</p>



<p>Of course, this means that things are still subject to change, so take anything you see with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>In the next few weeks, players will be diving into Cold Snap-related challenges in the form of the Trials circuit:</p>



<ul>
<li>Search Frozen Raider Containers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Rocketeers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Bastions</li>
</ul>



<p>Things change midway through January, as Cold Snap ends on January 13. For a week, Hidden Bunker will return as the map condition of choice, and then on the week starting January 19, a new condition called Toxic Swamp opens up.</p>



<p>We don’t know exactly what that means, but it’s a relatively safe assumption that it’ll be a condition tied exclusively to Dam, given that the map already has a prolific swamp region. The newest missions added to ARC Raiders also reference growing toxicity in the swamp, which could be a precursor to the new map condition.</p>

<p>One of the rarest cosmetic items in Fortnite is finally available after a seven-year wait, although there are still some major restrictions on getting your hands on the item.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling in Fortnite</a> has not appeared in the Item Shop since April 2018, where it was available across seven days after releasing before vanishing into the void. Now, though, Fortnite has made the item available again.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-rust-bucket-back-bling-returns">Fortnite Rust Bucket Back Bling Returns</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back again. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news of the return of the item comes from the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2001674471896170583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who reveals that it is distributed as a reward during the NVIDIA Cup taking place in various regions this weekend.</p>



<p>Any player who participates in the event and secures a minimum of eight points will receive the Rust Bucket Back Bling as a reward, although the tournament is not open to all players and there are eligibility requirements.</p>



<p>To complete, players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments during the past 180 days, have multi-factor authentication enabled on their account, and meet the age restrictions.</p>



<p>Due to these limitations, the Rust Bucket Back Bling will remain as one of Fortnite’s rarest and most exclusive items, with no suggestion that it will be available for direct purchase in the Item Shop anytime soon.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?source=shop&amp;sort=shop-longest-wait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.GG</a>, the Rust Bucket Back Bling is the second-rarest item across all of Fortnite, having not featured in the Item Shop for over 2,800 days, and is only behind the Mako Glider, which has not been in the Item Shop for over 2,900 days.</p>

		<p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but your backlog is so delightful, that you will certainly have something to play over the holiday period. Are you waiting for something new under the Christmas tree? Or will you hunker down and play your favourite titles as that’s just a little more cosy. I’ll be continuing my own cosy return to Monster Hunter World, which has come back into regular rotation thanks to the fact that the end game is still more satisfying and in depth that Monster Hunter Wilds. That said, there’s a new update there, so I’ll check that out over the weekend too. Besides that, I’ve really enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/">Neon Inferno</a>, Rogue Trader, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/aaero2-black-razor-edition-review/">Aaero2: Black Razor Edition</a> and Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked with Tef which has kept things pretty varied.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> was the first to pop in, and he’s been playing Shape of Dreams, calling it, “A really fun roguelike with MOBA-style abilities you can customise with gems and a really nice aesthetic.” That’s not all though, as he continued, “I’ve also downloaded a bunch of games to my Steam Deck, and am hoping to get through some Shadow of Wardor too in the brief window of time off I have.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has returned to his regular stomping ground by playing Destiny 2 just a little bit, but he’s mostly playing the annual favourite “How do I keep both my mother and the mother-in-law happy over Christmas.” He’s also been playing a game of ‘getting the stupidest gifts possible.’ He explains, “My cat is giving my boyfriend a year’s supply of antihistamines as he’s allergic to cats.” Sounds pretty thoughtful for a cat.</p>
<p>Having finished Dispatch this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> said, “It’s great, but too short and too episodic! Playing through it is like playing MGS5, with all the repeating credits and stuff.” He’s also tried a litany of things: CloverPit (Balatro for slot machines), News Tower, Megabonk, This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker (an idle clicker with cards and poker hands), Destropolis, and Mycopunk, with the latter he said, “It seems really good but my PC barely runs it.” He also played ‘starting Stranger Things from the beginning since it’s now finally finishing’. His review? “Pretty good.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “I’ve only had it since last Christmas… I’m enjoying it just exploring the planets, flying around space, and completing contracts as I go.”</p>

<p>Next up was <strong>Ade</strong>, and told us, “Along with playing the roguelike Wizards of Legend 2 with Laura (surely we must be getting close to defeating the first boss?!) I’ve also been on with the online coop shenanigans of Warhammer 40k Darktide (such a fun game!) And Metroid Prime 4.” He continues, “With Metroid Prime, I really can’t decide if I like it yet! Exploration is as brilliant as any other game in the series but there’s also a lot of fairly weak combat to slog through. Also, I can’t get over why this advanced species of psychic aliens are obsessed with motorbikes, so much so that the suit they’ve given to Sames makes her look like she’s competing in the Isle of Man TT. It’s a bit weird.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been getting back to clearing some of his physical media as he spent time in bed recovering from his bout of flu. What did he get up to? “I set up my 360 on an old monitor with headphone output and ploughed through the boring God of War clone Hellboy and the Science of Evil (only to discover that the real ending of the game is locked behind DLC that is no longer available…). I then started Quantum Theory which is the most 2010 game ever. Lots of Gears of War corridors and waist-high cover. In less physical gaming I played through some demos that were lurking from the last Next Fest to clear some hard drive space. And finally, I sat and played Sword of the Sea through which was a wonderfully chill and meditative time with awesome visuals and music.”</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> received a lovely treat from Ade: unadulterated horror! He thoughtfully bought Silent Hill f for her birthday this week. She said, “It’s been great fun going straight from Silent Hill 2 into playing the new one. I’m loving the traditional Silent Hill vibes but set in 1960s Japan. Everything I loved from 2, with spot-on tweaks to the gameplay elements. A birthday treat indeed!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been dipping in and out of a few games this week. I started by finishing up Ghost of Yotei which doesn’t have the most exciting ending, but I’m looking forward to exploring the open world and cross off some more bounties. I’ve now started playing Mafia: The Old Country which does an excellent job of slowly easing you into its early 1900s Sicilian setting – it’s been a couple of hours and I still haven’t fired a gun! Speaking of guns, I pulled the trigger and dove into Arc Raiders. For a PvP extraction shooter, the other players I’ve come across have all been surprisingly friendly, leading to cool impromptu encounters, helping each other take down Arcs and haul our loot to the exit zones.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> kept things short and sweet by playing a bunch of Fear &amp; Hunger: Termina, and a pinch of Fortnite, and finally, I gave it away in the opening, but <strong>Tef’s</strong> main gaming this week has been Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

              <p>Looking to finally invest in a Nintendo Switch? Now’s the time to lock one in, especially now that the holidays are here. Whether you like sitting on the couch, taking gaming on the go, or playing with friends at a get together, the Switch OLED version is a great console to bring home. It’s now the more affordable cousin of the Switch 2, and it’s available at an even lower price than usual.</p>
<p>If you think you’re ready to buy a Switch to start your new library of titles, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">Amazon has the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) for just $308, down from its usual price of $385.</a> That is a discount of $77 and 20% off. Now, keep in mind that this is a Renewed version of the console, so it’s not brand new, but it’s still well worth grabbing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One of Nintendo’s best portable gaming consoles</h2>
<p>One of the first things people notice about the OLED model is the display. It is wider and more vivid than the standard Switch screen, so colors look bright and bold whether you are on the go or playing in tabletop mode. This can make games feel more immersive and enjoyable, from exploring open worlds to playing puzzle games with friends.</p>
<p>Even though this unit is renewed, it still gives you the full Nintendo Switch experience. You can dock it to play on a TV just like a brand new model, or you can use it in handheld mode when you want gaming freedom without being tied to a screen in your living room. The joy con controllers are easy to detach for multiplayer games at a party or a family game night. You can also use the touch screen for compatible titles, which adds another layer of interaction.</p>



<p>The renewed model goes through inspection to make sure it works properly, which means you get the same game library and capabilities without paying full retail price. There may be a few cosmetic imperfections, but you’ll mostly be getting a blemish-free unit that’s been guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>With a huge library of games from all kinds of genres, the Switch is great for kids, teens, and adults who like variety in their play. From racing to role playing to fitness and rhythm games, there is stuff here for nearly everyone. It has become a go to portable console because it stays fun and fresh with new titles releasing regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">For just $308, down from $385, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) gives you plenty of value with a ton of ways to play.</a> Whether you’re giving it as a gift or keeping it for yourself, it’s a good idea to go ahead and lock yours in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doomed Xbox blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark</a> had "entire chapters" of performance capture work in the can before its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">shock cancelation this summer</a>, according to Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>, the voice behind Dragon Age's Inquisitor and Cyberpunk 2077's Alt Cunningham says she recorded scenes for The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot over the course of several years, beginning in 2023. "Lots" was done in 2024, with work continuing in early 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along, I'd done entire chapters of this universe," Regan said, adding that she was shocked to learn that Microsoft was pulling the plug, with The Initiative itself also set to be closed down as part of a wave of funding cuts and layoffs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan continued, saying she learned the studio's fate at the same time as it was announced publicly. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded," she added. "It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A further blow would come as last-ditch talks to salvage the project also fell through — a process Wilton-Regan admits she had insider knowledge of. Interestingly, the actress mentioned that Perfect Dark may have changed in scope had it been saved, with a "slimmed-down" version ultimately seeing the light of day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form," Wilton-Regan revealed. "Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a>, which IGN corroborated from its own sources, previously revealed that there had been a plan to keep Perfect Dark alive via the team working on the project at Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-initiative-is-teaming-up-with-crystal-dynamics-to-develop-the-new-perfect-dark-game">which had been serving as a co-developer</a>. Leadership from both Crystal and The Initiative reportedly spent two months looking for a new publisher and funding source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While multiple parties expressed interest, the most likely candidate turned out to be Take-Two Interactive. However, the two groups couldn't come to an agreement, at least in part due to disagreements over long-term ownership of the property. As a result, the deal fell through, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">resulting in layoffs</a> at Crystal Dynamics as all hope of the project being reinstated vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-hires-former-perfect-dark-leads-for-brand-new-2k-studio">Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton had now been hired by 2K</a> to start a brand new outfit. No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilton-Regan, while she may have lost the Joanna Dark gig, this month's big Tomb Raider reveal at The Game Awards revealed that the actress was now the official new video game Lara Croft. She'll star in next year's reimagining of the original Lara Croft adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, as well as all-new blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, due in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sony and Honda have announced its new car will include PlayStation Remote Play, so passengers can stream PS4 and PS5 games on the go.</p>
<p>The Afeela 1 will be the first car from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, established in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. The car will be available in California first in 2026.</p>
<p>PlayStation Remote Play will be integrated into the Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system, so you'll need a PS4 or PS5 console at home to make use of the feature.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also feature an integrated display and premium audio system with which to play games. Presumably, you'll need to take your PlayStation controller with you on the road.</p>
<p>Note this use of Remote Play is separate to streaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> via the cloud.</p>
<p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Izumi Kawanishi, representative director, president and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc.</p>
<p>"Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p>
<p>This is by no means the first time we've seen in-vehicle gaming. Back in 2022,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casual-games-will-be-playable-on-a-bmw-next-year"> BMW announced it would begin offering casual gaming in its cars</a>, controlled using smartphones.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Tesla announced in-vehicle Steam integration</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-pulls-steam-from-new-vehicles-as-its-new-gaming-computer-is-no-longer-capable-of-playing-steam-games">18 months later it was dropped</a>.</p>
