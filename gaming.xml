            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Skate Story</em> is two very different things simultaneously. On the one hand, it’s a visceral take on skateboarding, providing a tight, fast, ground-level view as you brute-force your way through tricks and combos. But it’s also a surrealist trip through the underworld where you control a skateboarding demon who faces off against the devil. Think of it like Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> meets <em>Thrasher</em> magazine, and you’re most of the way there.</p><p>The premise is actually quite a bit stranger than just skating through hell. You play as a demon made of glass, who is both hungry and tired, and so decides to… eat the moon. This pisses off the devil, and your response is to delve into the deeper layers of hell where even more tasty moons of various colors await. You’re guided by a talking rabbit, and at various points you’ll meet a pigeon blogger, frog barista, a cute bag of trash, and a whole lot of talking skeletons.</p><p>The result is sort of a mashup of skateboarding and adventure games. In order to descend further into hell, you’ll need to complete tasks, which mostly involve doing a lot of skateboarding. <em>Skate Story</em>’s world is essentially divided into three types of levels. There are hub areas where you can skate freely, and also take on tasks like doing the devil’s laundry or find a permit so you can take a nap. Usually this involves pulling off specific combos of tricks, collecting items, or chasing down something or someone. There are also fast-paced sequences where you speed down a set path trying not to crash while racing through portals, and elaborate boss battles where you have to defeat eldritch horrors by pulling off combos.</p><p>Basically, it’s a lot of skateboarding with some cryptic and occasionally philosophical dialogue thrown in. Which is just fine because the skating in <em>Skate Story</em> is excellent. The action plays out from a third-person perspective, but with the camera in nice and tight, sort of like <em>Gears of War</em>, bringing you really close to what’s going on. So even though <em>Skate Story</em> is pretty forgiving — wiping out means shattering your glass body, but you can restart immediately — it feels incredibly tense and reactive. Actions have weight to them. Even better: the controls are relatively straightforward, at least by skateboarding standards, so it’s possible to do cool combos without warping your hand into a claw. The game also really gradually introduces new concepts letting you slowly get the hang of things. You don’t even learn how to grind until a few chapters in.</p><p>What really brings the two sides of <em>Skate Story</em> together is its sense of style. This is the coolest looking game I’ve played in ages. Almost everything is harsh and gritty, from the goth color scheme to the jagged glowing spikes that serve as obstacles. There are towering red skeletons just lazing about, and levels that look like you’re grinding through a hellish version of New York City, complete with bagel shops and subway tunnels. It looks like nothing else I’ve ever played, particularly when you mix in the adorable side characters, who soften things, and the surprisingly chill soundtrack that helps you get in that flow state so necessary to skating.</p><div><p>We’re currently living through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/663070/skateboarding-games-tony-hawk-skate-city">an amazing period for skateboarding games</a>, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/704560/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-nintendo-switch-2-comparison">the big-budget <em>Tony Hawk</em> remakes</a> to indie experiments like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade"><em>Skate City</em></a>. Even still, <em>Skate Stor</em>y manages to stand out. For all of its surreal elements, it really understands skateboarding, and it turns out that hell is the ideal skate park.</p></div><p><sub>Skate Story <em>is out December 8th on the PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/840004/skate-story-review-switch-steam-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nearly a decade after it was first teased,&nbsp; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a><span> is finally out on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Samus Aran’s latest first-person sci-fi adventure is a visual treat that features some well-designed levels that provide hours of satisfying exploration and puzzle-solving. Unfortunately, annoying NPCs, a big ol’ boring desert, and a nothingburger villain make this a messy, so-so entry in the </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>franchise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>starts with a large-scale galactic battle that wouldn’t be out of place in a </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> game. An army of Space Pirates, led by </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>villain Sylux, is attacking a Galactic Federation facility, and Samus arrives to save the day. But shortly after showing up, Samus, Sylux, and some Federation troops are teleported to the faraway alien planet of Viewros, which is where </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> takes place. Here, Samus is isolated on a mysterious alien world and—</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-sounding notification beep* </b><i><span>Hey, good job reading the second paragraph of this review. If you are unsure of what to do next, you could try scrolling down to the next paragraph of text! This should help you move forward! You’re doing great!&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Well, okay, Samus isn’t really isolated and alone on Viewros. Instead, a plucky squad of Galactic Federation troopers is located on the planet, too. Very early on, you encounter one of them, Myles, who is written as if he fell out of an MCU movie. The other troopers you meet are also different flavors of annoying, with each falling into one overused sci-fi soldier trope, from baby rookie to cool, silent sniper. There’s even a robot who is polite and comical! The whole gang’s here. And they all ruin the vibes constantly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">None of these chuckleheads will shut the hell up</a>! When you discover each of them while exploring the game’s various levels and biomes, they end up working alongside you for an extended period of time and offer tips that seem to imply they think Samus is a buffoon. Stuff like “Scan that computer” or “Put a bomb there.” Yet all of them also treat Samus as if she’s Space Jesus and the coolest, most badass person ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The worst of these offenders is Myles, who will call up Samus while she’s out exploring the open desert that connects </span><i><span>Pime 4’</span></i><span>s various levels and side areas and bug you to do this or that. A few times, I was out trying to find secrets and Myles intervened, marking a spot on my map for me to go to next. Thank god you’re here, Myles, or I might have enjoyed a few minutes of quiet exploration and discovery!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When the federation squadmates aren’t squawking, and it’s just Samus alone on a strange planet trying to solve puzzles and progress forward, </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> is a much better game.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651408">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The level design is exquisite, with each of the various biomes you explore and return to feeling both large and complicated without being confusing or a slog to work through. I’ve already talked about how much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><span>I love Volt Forge</span></a><span>, the first real level you visit in </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span>, but the other areas are also fantastic. The legally mandated ice level, Ice Belt, is an often claustrophobic and creepy trek through an abandoned laboratory that was doing some strange alien tests. It ditches the ice caves and snow of most ice levels for sterile labs and windy alcoves that are all properly desolate and dreary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And of course, inside all of these levels are various alien enemies to fight, which isn’t a problem because combat in </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> is fantastic, even if it is more or less the same gunplay found in past </span><i><span>Prime </span></i><span>titles. You lock on, hop around and lob missiles, energy blasts, and elemental-themed shots at a varied selection of critters and robots. Certain enemies have different weaknesses, like ice blasts, which help you clear the hordes more effectively. It ain’t new, but it still feels good, and running at 120FPS, it looks incredible.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s probably the biggest compliment I can pay to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</span></i><span> This is a visually stunning, aesthetically cohesive first-person action shooter that runs like a dream. I never once encountered a FPS drop that was noticeable or ran into an area that looked ugly. Every inch of </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> delivers sharp, stylized sci-fi visuals that pop on a big 4K TV. This ain’t what I expect from a first-party Nintendo game, but I’m not complaining about it. I loved it so much, and it makes me hopeful for future Nintendo games on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-sounding notification beep*</b> <i><span>Hey, writer, don’t forget to mention the desert and the motorcycle! These are features in Metroid Prime 4, the game you played, and are worth including in your review. Use the keyboard to write about them in the next paragraph.&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Right, the desert. This is the most baffling part of</span><i><span> Prime 4.</span></i><span> The large Sol Valley desert acts as a strange, mostly empty hub area connecting the different levels together. To help Samus traverse this large space, </span><i><span>Prime 4</span></i><span> gives the player a cool motorcycle. And it </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> cool, and feels great to drive. Hitting a dune while boosting and flying across the sands is sick shit. But the open desert just becomes a boring way to slow the game down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Find a new upgrade that will let you explore more of a past level? Cool. You get to drive all the way back to that level. Want to go get some upgrades now that you have a new Morph Ball ability? Well, guess what, you gotta drive through the desert again. Worse, to get into and out of the desert, Samus is forced through at least two different loading areas that make it feel barely connected to the rest of the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Hey, this is the back-of-the-box quote, Samus! You should read this.”   </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Retro Studios  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person sci-fi adventure shooter  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Stunning visuals, great level design, and solid performance  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Annoying squadmates, the boring desert, Sylux, and the ending  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played)   </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Completed the main story and around 30% of the side content in 11 hours  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date</p>                 <p>December 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>The desert also seems to imply </span><i><span>Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-ended adventure, but it ain’t. Like past </span><i><span>Metroid </span></i><span>games, you collect power-ups and unlock more of the game world in a mostly pre-determined order. And that would be more than fine if the desert didn’t seem to set up this idea that you had more freedom than you really do. It’s just a big empty waste of space that shouldn’t have been included in P</span><i><span>rime 4 </span></i><span>at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And while exploring the desert, Myles will keep yelling at you to do this or check on that or open your map to go here, and it just becomes so tedious and annoying. Worse, to reach the game’s ending, you have to collect a ton of green crystals that spawn in the desert. I didn’t have enough when I got to the final moments of </span><i><span>Prime 4,</span></i><span> so I had to spend 30 minutes or so driving around the desert collecting gems while Myles repeated the same tip about harvesting the damn things. The word torture popped into my head a few times during all of this.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>*Sci-fi-souding notification beep* </b><i><span>Oh no! Don’t forget Sylux! This is a villain that has been a part of Metroid for years now, but gets a bigger role than ever in this latest sequel. You should discuss him and his appearance in Prime 4 in the next paragraph.&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote> <p><span>Dear god, leave me alone, Myles. But yes, Sylux is in this game. And that’s… about all I have to say about that. I’m not trying to avoid spoilers; I just have nothing else to add. His presence is so minimal that at first I thought he was just a fun cameo included at the start. But no, you technically </span><i><span>(sort of) </span></i><span>see him a few more times before the end.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What are his motivations? Why does he do anything he does in this game, which is very little? Why should anyone who, like me, hasn’t played the games he appeared in previously care about any of this? The game only really answers one of these questions if you manage to get 100 percent and unlock the secret extra ending. For everyone else, kick rocks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond </span></i><span>is a good game made worse by some really bad choices. It features annoying characters who ruin the isolated and haunting vibes that this latest sequel strives so hard to create, and forces Samus to drive across a boring desert over and over and over again for no good reason other than forcing you to do some extra busy work to extend</span><i><span> Prime 4’</span></i><span>s runtime to around 11 hours for most people.</span></p>

<p>The countdown to a physical release begins</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playtonic and PM Studios have today released a free Switch 2 demo for the throwback platforming remake <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, giving you a chance to try before you buy.</p>
<p>You'll find the new demo on the Switch 2 eShop right now, and, you'll be pleased to hear, all the data carries over to the full game — so there's no time wasted if you choose to go all-in on the full release afterwards.</p>
<p>The demo announcement kicks off Playtonic's 10-day countdown to the release of the Yooka-Replaylee physical, which launches on 18th December. This boxed release bundles in a map and some stickers alongside the pièce de résistance, the full game on a cartridge.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we had a good time with Yooka-Replaylee at launch, saying that it "feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story</link>
            <guid>1376299</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Skate Story Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161005/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>“My games are concepts and feelings that I can't describe in words,” solo developer Sam Eng <a href="https://www.chanel.com/gb/chanel-next-prize/2024/sam-eng/">said in a 2024 interview for Chanel</a>, after winning the brand’s prestigious Next Prize. “Everything I encounter, I try to portray in a gameplay or audio-visual experience.”</p>
<p>These quotes give a taste of how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> has been designed. It’s driven by an artistic impulse that tempts me to say ‘It won’t be for everyone’ (here I’m thinking of the offbeat narrative that ends in an abstract sequence a little like the finale of <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong>), but I hesitate. It’s clear that Sam Eng is having fun and not taking himself too seriously, and I truly enjoyed my playthrough.</p>
<p>You take on the role of a demon kept awake in the underworld by the bright light of a moon. To fix this problem — and also to satisfy your hunger — you decide to <em>eat</em> the moon. This in turn leads to signing a contract with the devil to obtain a skateboard, all so you can reach the moon faster. And next, as you explore the underworld, you’re drawn into side quests to meet the whims of some offbeat characters - rabbits, frogs, skulls, a disembodied philosopher head, even a talking pillow creature.</p>
<figure><a title="Skate Story Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160997/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of the fetch quests and other demands reminded me of the overworld busywork of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/no_more_heroes">No More Heroes</a> (an impression helped by some similar sound cues) – but with a <em>much</em> more laid-back energy.</p>
<p>Over roughly seven hours and nine different chapters, you test your skating skills to stop gas seeping from drains, to clean up obelisks so a giant rubbish bag can be taken out, to locate and dry the devil’s washing, and much more besides. You might have to collect letters for a pigeon distractedly finishing up a screenplay, or find and repair a gemstone for a demonic penguin. The action takes part in an afterlife decked out with laundrettes, subways, cafés, and surreal houses. It all sounds odd, but it works.</p>
<p>These tasks frequently escalate into challenges where you have to perform a certain sequence of moves, or battle moons and ‘fuss’ (underworld anti-skating authorities) by performing and chaining tricks and grinds. The gameplay variety is rounded out by kinetic skate courses – routes you navigate through combinations of grinds, slides, ollies, and more, avoiding lips and risky gaps to prevent crashing and shattering into pieces while racing toward supernatural archways.</p>
<figure><a title="Skate Story Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160996/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Timers and other challenges add urgency, but Skate Story is rarely difficult. Instead, the real draw lies in the overall presentation. Eng — who made the game over six years — has spoken of his desire to capture the feeling of night-time skating through New York, his home, while listening to synth-wave music. To achieve this, he’s collaborated with musicians Blood Cultures, and he pretty much nails his intentions.</p>
<p>Combined with the low-fi crystalline visual style and an expertly crafted feel to the skating itself — complete with a convincingly shaky ‘skate video’ camera — there are passages of Skate Story that are delightful to play through. You feel as if it’s you out there landing tricks, letting loose, enjoying music with the glittering lights of a strange underworld surrounding you.</p>
<p>And I’ll go further with my praise: the climax features an extended sequence with audiovisual ambition that I’ve not seen anywhere else. One ‘boss’ section, with pumping drums, and some visual touches I won’t spoil, will go down as one of my favourite video game moments in years. It’s the kind of idiosyncratic experience that likely only ever happens with solo developers. There were a few other surprises too, but — yes — I've already revealed too much.</p>
<figure><a title="Skate Story Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161002/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also true to say that I’ve never seen a game with a graphical style quite like Skate Story’s. One frustration is that the glass-like nature of the protagonist and the appealing lo-fi fuzz are difficult to do justice in still images. The characters and buildings give a thrifty sense of making the most out of the materials at hand, but the overall design is so memorable and the animations — especially while skating — are so strong that any visual limitations have been turned into strengths. In motion it looks lovely, full of ambient spectral mist and cinematic ambition.</p>
<p>But…and there is a small 'but'. My only real complaint is that, once I reached the final credits, I felt the skating could have been pushed <em>a little</em> further. The final section is the best part of the game, but it also represents the only moment of real challenge. Despite the authentic-feeling skating, I was never really forced to master much more than chaining a few tricks together.</p>
<p>Really, though, I’m nitpicking. I was just left wanting more of the really good stuff. Ultimately, Sam Eng has achieved something very strong with Skate Story. Performance is excellent on the Switch 2, both handheld and docked – although I gravitated toward the ‘performance’ mode over ‘quality’. The smooth frame rate suits the gameplay, and the low-fi presentation makes any reduction in fidelity unnoticeable unless you compare images side by side. Even then, the difference is marginal.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are moments of gameplay during the climax of Skate Story that are some of the most visceral, original, and downright impressive that I’ve experienced for a very long time. Its great-feeling skating isn’t always pushed to its limits, but the sheer craft, personality, and audiovisual flair throughout largely compensate.</p>
<p>Overall, Skate Story is an enjoyable, offbeat adventure game with a striking, unique identity. It might not be difficult, but if its tone speaks to you, you’ll find plenty to appreciate for its relatively short duration: sliding at speed around corners, landing shove-its, jumping across crevices, grinding through crystalline underworlds, and, yes, eating moons – all to a superb soundtrack.</p></section>

			<p>You might wonder how a demon making a pact with the Devil to eat the Moon translates into a game about skateboarding. I’ve played Skate Story and I still can’t entirely answer that. What I can tell you is that Skate Story is a beautiful, surreal, poetic journey through the underworld, emblazoned with neon, crystal, and hellfire. It is unlike anything else you’ve played this year, and about as far from Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater as it’s possible to be, while sharing the same basic mechanics. Somehow, it works. Perhaps developer Sam Eng might also have made a pact of their own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skate Story | OUT DECEMBER 8 ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Je1WXy3T6o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You are the Skater, a demon who’s attempting to win back his soul from the Devil by eating the Moon. You’re granted a skateboard to achieve this mammoth task because the moon is a very long way away. This being a pact with the Devil, it’s not without downsides: not only does he lease the Skater’s soul back to him, but he also turns the Skater to glass, which, as you may be aware, is not an ideal material for a skateboarder to be made of.</p>



<p>Still, the Devil gets more than he bargains for with the Skater, who descends on his skateboard through the seven levels of hell, freeing souls, exploring trash bags, and giving philosophers soft drinks, all the while firing off kickflips, ollies and grinds. He remains unfazed by the surreal sights and sounds he encounters, and the pervasive air of normality in this unreal setting lends Skate Story some seriously off-kilter vibes. It is, in a word, brilliant.</p>

<p>It’s also utterly beautiful. Shadowy half-spaces loom out of the darkness, ledges, slopes and kerbs beckoning to you while neon sparks and stars glimmer all around and the blazing red of hellfire pens you in on both sides. The glass skater’s crystalline body refracts the light, glimmering beneath the infernal contract he wears as a scarf, while the denizens of the underworld are monstrous, beguiling and unique. Despite the danger and fragility of your situation, these are welcoming spaces, asking you to skate every surface possible, while helping those that you can.</p>

<p>This is still skateboarding. You steadily gain many of the moves you’d expect, starting from a simple ollie, and ramping up into kickflips, manuals and 360 Pop Shuvits. At times, you’re racing through the underworld, speeding along while avoiding hellish obstacles; at others, you’re using those moves to build up a combo to attack a supernatural foe. Sometimes, it could almost be Session, Skate or Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, but then a glowing rabbit talks to you, or you ram into a ledge and shatter into a million pieces. It’s still a more fundamental and realistic vision of skateboarding than many other games, an odd juxtaposition with the unreal setting.</p>
<p>Skate Story’s writing and overarching storytelling is often obtuse, but it never fails to be intriguing and unusually captivating. Conversations and asides are oddly mundane, at odds with the otherworldly characters speaking them, while story sections appear as lines of poetry. As a metaphor for perseverance, punishment and putting yourself back together, Skate Story just works. Some games might simply have used the story as a framework to hang the incredible visuals from, but Sam Eng has created something thoroughly unique across the board. It gives Skate Story an incredible, arresting atmosphere, and one which I immediately wanted to dive back into.</p>

<p>Everything has an 80s, VHS sci-fi horror vibe, and the incredible soundtrack from Blood Cultures brings a dark blend of synth, pop, electronica, hip-hop and jazz, ethereal tones and thumping beats enhancing the off-kilter, otherworldly sensations even further. It easily stands as a late entrant in the soundtrack of the year conversation, and brings the game full circle, marrying skateboarding and underground music in a brilliantly effective way.</p>

            <p>
In an ideal world, none of us would have to be bound by the rope called copyright, we could produce all the media we want about our favourite things, like that Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisend and Cinderella ship I have now likely made many of you aware of. Alas, this is not the world we live in, and because of that fact the team by the upcoming mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> Classic is having to rename it after a bit of a prompting from the original game's creators, Valve.
</p>
<p>
"As most of you pieced together quickly, Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic," the modding team explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040">Steam post</a> over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
"When we submitted our demo for Steam Next Fest, the review process was held up on IP rights. This was expected, and it had already happened to our main app, so we contacted Valve to get it cleared up. Upon doing so, we were met with the request to rename our mod. We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September."
</p>
<p>
Not being able to launch the demo led to the team focusing on the mod's rebrand, though apparently deciding on a new name was pretty tricky. Namely that was because they couldn't really find any other word apart from "classic" that conveyed what it needed to, and fit the same acronym of TF2C. 
</p><p>
Despite "Classified" not being considered seriously as a name to start with, as time went on, its double meaning, with the word's origin "classify" evoking "'to make something classic" and its literal definition," that lended itself well "into the spy film theming that early TF2 had carried," meant that it ultimately won out in the end.
</p>
<p>
Alongside all of this rebranding is one more bit of news, however: the mod has been delayed to January 30th, 2026. It's not the new name that's led to this, by the way, it's a few different reasons, including the classic need for more polishing and testing, but also because it'll need to go through the Steamworks review process.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about this mod yet, the main focus of it is to bring the classic (word choice purposeful) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more in line with its original inspirations and tone, bringing back things like some cut weapons and Multi-Team maps, as well as completely new features like new gamemods, items, and visual enhancements.

              <p><span>The Streamer Awards, an annual ceremony celebrating the best in live-streaming hosted and produced by QTCinderella, took place over the weekend in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some genuinely touching moments, like adorable grandma and jigsaw puzzle aficionado <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ijustlovepuzzles">ijustlovepuzzles</a> winning the Hidden Gem award, and a touching speech from Best Breakout Streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adapt">FaZe Adapt</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCvMC6vemM">The Streamer Awards</a> was mostly three and a half hours of people regularly rewarded for behaving badly doing just that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you aren’t privy to the interpersonal drama and controversy surrounding the professional streamer space, that’s okay. I wish I could </span><i><span>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span></i><span> a lot of this information from my head. Just know that in the months leading up to the fifth annual Streamer Awards, host QTCinderella has broken down on her stream, citing stress around organizing the event, while other streamers (mostly ones not nominated for awards) accused her of rigging the ceremony. It was the special brand of drama-farming and rage-baiting that has come to define the streamer space.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just like earlier this year at San Diego’s TwitchCon, during which streamer Emiru (who won Best Creative Arts Streamer on Saturday) was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitchcon-assault-video-cosplay-streamer-2000637226"><span>physically assaulted at a meet-and-greet</span></a><span> and “clip farmers” acted out on the convention floor and outside of it, bad behavior was on full display this Saturday at The Streamer Awards.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Multiple clips circulated on social media over the weekend that are a cogent reminder of how young and, in many cases, small-minded some of the most popular streamers are. A 17-year-old streamer known as Rakai, who recently got a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1pcsvzd/twitch_partner_rakai_has_been_banned_for_2_years/"><span>two-year suspension for stealing flowers from Walmart while live</span></a><span>, approached a married, </span><a href="https://x.com/SlatDontMiss/status/1997473082601099651"><span>lesbian couple while live-streaming to ask them if they were gay</span></a><span>, not long after asking a different woman streamer if she “had a man.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Co-host FanFan, who mingled amongst attendees’ tables during the ceremony, </span><a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1997496510091550723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1997496510091550723%7Ctwgr%5Ed2c8b429f5603e06934a254da23384087baad6ca%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-3543798751762506370.ampproject.net%2F2510081644000%2Fframe.html"><span>made a joke comparing Kai Cenat</span></a><span>, who is Black, to Sean “Diddy” Combs, “congratulating” him on his new documentary with 50 Cent. </span><i><span>Sean Combs: The Reckoning</span></i><span>, a four-part documentary examining the life and behavior of the rapper recently imprisoned for transportation of prostitution, just aired on Netflix. It was produced by 50 Cent. Immediately after her joke, an influencer named Tylil grabbed the mic FanFan was passing around to state, “If y’all gonna be making jokes, at least make it funny.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The streamer awards: *fat joke* *gay joke* *anti black joke* *another gay joke* *another anti black joke*,” </span><a href="https://x.com/memebag_/status/1997705007899279646"><span>read a post on X</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">India Love gets booed off stage after claiming DDG and Rakai deserved Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt 👀<a href="https://t.co/0IA0gN8As4">pic.twitter.com/0IA0gN8As4</a></p> <p>— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) <a href="https://twitter.com/FearedBuck/status/1997541200111219147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>At one point during the show, influencer India Love stormed the stage to insist that two other streamers, controversial rapper DDG and the aforementioned Rakai, deserved to win Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt. Love was booed off-stage and later apologized while livestreaming. “There was no excuse for my behavior,” </span><a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1997914755751718920"><span>she said</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year. </p> <p>Reap what you sow type shit.</p> <p>— Sean (@SeanDaBlack) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanDaBlack/status/1997682224557437387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>“My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year,” wrote streamer SeanDaBlack on X. “Reap what you sow type shit.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Moments like </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@twitch/video/7580961051093503246"><span>ijustlovepuzzles winning the Hidden Gem award</span></a><span> helped elevate The Streamer Awards’ vibes—the older woman streamer, who has 46,000 followers on Twitch, was incredibly emotional as she received her award. “I was in such a dark place when my kids created this Twitch account and gave me something to do. This stream gave me life,” she said.</span></p> <p><span>If streaming were more about platforming interesting people who genuinely love what they do and less about rewarding teen boys for misbehaving, maybe The Streamer Awards would be less tough to watch. Other winners included Flats for Best </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> streamer, TheBurntPeanut for Best FPS Streamer and best VTuber, </span><i><span>Peak</span></i><span> for Stream Game of the Year, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ishowspeed-crawley-tiktok-wizard-bark-off-twitch-clip-1851573475"><span>iShowSpeed</span></a><span> for Streamer of the Year.</span></p>

<p>The first week of additions, which includes the two new Jianghu Legacy quests, is already available at the time of this writing. The second week additions, which include the new River Master campaign boss and the big highlight of the Roaring Sands region, will arrive at the end of this week, alongside the game's launch on iOS and Android mobile devices.</p>



<p>The second new boss fight of the month, Feng Ruzhi, will arrive in the third week, alongside two limited-time activities. The final week offers the Scarlet Shock Sword Trial and Hero's Realm: Blade Dance activity, on top of a festively themed Fireworks Festival.</p>



<p>As post-launch content goes, it's clear that NetEase and Everstone have hit the ground running, ready to build off the momentum of the game's strong launch. If it can keep up its numbers now that millions of players have already stepped into its world, it could be the next Genshin Impact-level multiplayer action RPG.</p>



<p>For more on Where Winds Meet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">check out Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, who gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

			<p>The development of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 began even before the release of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></a>. Over the past year or so, director Naoki Hamaguchi teased how the experience, likely deeply rooted in the introduction of the Highwind airship, will be different from its predecessors while confirming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/"><strong>development was proceeding smoothly.</strong></a> And finally, we are nearing the point at which more information on the highly anticipated game can be shared, the first reportedly coming before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@julienchieze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Julien Chièze</strong></a>, Hamaguchi-san commented on the current development state of the game, confirming that its experience is almost complete as the development team is focusing on fully fleshing out the experience.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, honestly, I want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but since it's a game, we must properly finish the detailed work, and only then can we deliver it to the users,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said in regards to when Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will launch. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, after properly going through that [fleshing out] phase, we want to deliver it to everyone in a satisfactory form, so if you can just wait a little longer, I believe we will reach the stage where we can deliver various information to everyone,"</em> he added.</p>



<p>Speaking about the game's final name, Hamaguchi-san said that he and Tetsuya Nomura have <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"narrowed down"</em> the options to two, and he expects the final choice to be made before the end of the year.</p>

<p>While it may be too early to see Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 in action, the fact that we are nearing the point when more can be shared about it is definitely exciting. As for when this moment will arrive, it's not easy to say. Though unlikely if the game's name hasn't been finalized yet, if an announcement accompanied by the very first footage is coming before the end of the year, this week's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</strong></a> would be the perfect occasion to begin the marketing cycle for one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the next few years.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't see the light of day anytime soon, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S owners who did not have the chance to play the Remake trilogy yet will finally get their chance next year, starting with Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade, which<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">launches this January on the Nintendo and Microsoft current-generation systems.</strong></a> The other two entries in the trilogy will also launch on both systems in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Sorry, <em>Shenmue </em>fans, but <em>Shenmue 3 </em>is still the latest <em>Shenmue </em>game for now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ys Net goes on to say that the use of its logo, as well as the attempt to mislead viewers into thinking the footage is official, "constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition".</p><p>As such, the developer says it's "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action". It sounds like whoever made that footage might be dealing with some uncomfortable queries soon.</p><p>Although some believed the <em>Shenmue 4 </em>footage to be real, others suggested it had been made with generative AI, pointing to certain animations and the slightly-too-reverent story content in the trailer as proof.</p><p>Of course, being made with generative AI doesn't mean the trailer isn't real by itself; many studios, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and, indeed, <em>Shenmue </em>owner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Sega</a>, have embraced the technology in one form or another. Still, this particular <em>Shenmue 4 </em>balloon has been thoroughly popped, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>The <em>Shenmue 4 </em>footage doing the rounds might not be real, but that doesn't mean the franchise has no future.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in August, Ys Net <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba817600-c94e-4669-a165-612cf6c34c02" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced an enhanced version</a> of <em>Shenmue 3 </em>for modern platforms, bringing improvements like camera tweaks, stamina adjustments, and skippable cutscenes.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, it's the first big DLC expansion for <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and it introduces two brand new Nightlord bosses to take on, including the fearsome Dreglord.</p><p>As well as the two extra bosses, <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>adds a new map (although it's technically just a Shifting Earth condition) to explore, plus new bosses from <em>Souls </em>series history, new enemies, and plenty more.</p><p>You can also play as two brand new characters in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, namely the Scholar and the Undertaker, who bring disparate play styles to make your expeditions into the parallel land of Limveld more exciting.</p>
<p>As for the base game itself, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>is an experimental spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6919a2a8-7d6a-4b7b-ba51-02f9b15b7407" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">multi-million-selling open-world Soulslike</a>, one which mixes elements of games like <em>Fortnite </em>and extraction shooters into FromSoftware's signature blend of exploration and combat.</p><p>The game sees teams of up to three players heading into a constantly-changing map in order to scavenge gear, battle enemies and bosses to level up, and take on an especially powerful bespoke encounter at the conclusion of each three-day run.</p><p>You can check out <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>and its <em>Forsaken Hollows </em>DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> right now, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6d6f261-ff0a-4fbc-9eea-253dd2d55ca7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">my review of the base game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption>Longtime <em>Tekken </em>director Katsuhiro Harada is leaving Bandai Namco at the end of this year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Harada goes on to say that he's spent the last "four to five years" handing off responsibilities for <em>Tekken </em>to the franchise's development team, including the "stories and worldbuilding [he] oversaw", so his departure shouldn't come as too much of a shock for <em>Tekken</em>.</p><p>As for what's next for Harada, he says he'll "share more about [his] next steps at a later date".

He says that he will be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January, albeit "as a guest", so you'll see him there if you check out that event.</p><p>Additionally, to say goodbye to <em>Tekken</em>, Harada has created a "DJ-style nonstop mix" of music from the franchise that he "personally edited".

            <p>They might <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">not have committed</a> to making any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> ending the canon one, but the folks behind Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> have been quick to decide they'd like to get started on filming a third series as soon as they can. Summer 2026, if all goes well, so the radioactive glow of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">imminent second series</a> hasn't totally faded to background levels by the time a follow-up drops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So said executive producer Jonathan Nolan in a recent chat with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer">Ian Games Network</a>.</p>
<p>"With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," the producer outlined. "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all." He then added: "I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend. You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>Well, the conundrum outlined in that last bit sounds <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">similiar to another medium</a>, especially as the last couple of Fallout entries grow more and more distant in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>As it is, I'm not surprised that having been given the green light earlier this year Fallout's showrunners are keen to keep pressing on while they've got momentum. It's not like they'll need time to decide the basics of where the third series will go either, having sketched out some stuff all the way up to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fallout-tv-star-says-his-characters-plot-has-been-planned-up-to-at-least-season-5-or-6/">fifth or sixth season</a> according to Maximus actor Aaron Moten.</p><p>I am interested to see which location's next on the road trip list of Lucy and co, with the series now having done arguably the two biggest stops on the non Bethesda-developed Fallout tour - California and Nevada. Maybe it'll be off to the Midwest for some Fallout: Tactics deep cuts.</p>
<p>I jest, but to be honest if the trend of revisiting locations is set to continue, it'd be nice to see an entry that isn't already given prominent billing given a bit of a spotlight. I mean, most of the gear and props will likely still be made to look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-ish in the name of corporate synergy, but hey, I'm used to that by now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-offloads-tuf-gaming-graphics-card-even-further-after-black-friday-as-the-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-hits-an-all-time-low-2000651222</link>
            <guid>1376242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Graphic card upgrades can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Right now, you can pick the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB OC edition gaming graphics card without paying the full price, courtesy of a deal currently live on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/">On a regular day, it would run you around $540, but you can snap it up at a 30% discount right now, which drops the price to $378.</a> This is its lowest it’s dropped to in quite some time, and is packed with everything you need to push some gaming and creative boundaries this holiday season. It’s selling out like crazy, though, which is why we recommend grabbing yours before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Efficiency With Impressive Heat Dissipation</h2>
<p>ASUS has designed this thing with military-grade components for exceptional performance and reliability. We’re talking certified military-grade TUF chokes and MOSFETs to deliver impressive power to the GPU for better stability, plus 5K black metallic capacitors for wider temperature tolerance and a longer lifespan than other options in this range. The protective conformal coating makes the graphics card temperature (high and low), shock, humidity, and fog resistant, while the dual ball fan bearings ensure quiet cooling even when things get intense.</p>
<p>Speaking of intense gaming/creative sessions, you’ll also appreciate the axial-tech upgrades with fans that propel more air, and the high-quality diecast shroud with aluminum backplate featuring larger vents for even better heat dissipation. The MaxContact design expands the surface area of the heat spreader by 5% when needed to keep the overall GPU temperatures and prevent thermal throttling. Fans are also designed to stop when the temperature reaches below 50 degrees Celsius, letting you enjoy quieter performance during less resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>As for the performance, RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you play. You’re getting fifth-gen tensor cores that deliver incredible AI performance with FP4 and DLSS4, new streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neural shaders, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores for mega geometry. Translation? Low latency and improved visual quality for all your favorite titles. Responsiveness comes from Reflex 2, which offers quicker target acquisition and better reaction times, as well as introduces Frame Warp to further reduce latency based on the latest mouse input in the game. Customization options let you monitor performance and tweak settings based on your own preferences. This is done through GPU Tweak III, where you can overclock, undervolt, and monitor real-time stats with an intuitive interface.​ You’ll also enjoy access to MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app with your purchase, plus get a complimentary membership to Adobe Creative Cloud, all Apps.​</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to upgrade the way you play your favorite titles or work on some creative projects, you need a solid graphics card in your setup. These don’t come in cheap, and discounts on some of the best options out there are few and far between, which makes this deal one worth grabbing. You’re saving $162 on an option that’s going to completely transform your experience, but the discount wraps up soon. Grab it before that happens!</p>

<p>A new report reveals that Netflix considered acquiring Electronic Arts, Disney, and Fox, but none of those deals came to fruition. </p>



<p>Netflix is the new big dog in town, ever since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the company would acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion in 2026, likely giving it access to studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche. New details reveal they have considered buying other major companies, including EA and Disney. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-debated-pursuing-ea-disney-and-fox">Netflix ‘Debated Pursuing’ EA, Disney, and Fox</h2>



<p>A new Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about Netflix CEO wooing Trump ahead of Warner Bros.’ bid says the company considered acquisitions of EA, Disney, and Fox. It first talks about how Netflix is an “unlikely bidder”, as co-founder and chairman, Reed Hastings, avoids major deals to build things “from scratch”. The company’s management “debated pursuing just about every major asset put up for sale, including&nbsp;Electronic Arts Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fox.” They also considered acquiring Disney at one point. </p>



<p>However, the “executives could never coalesce behind a deal.” Additionally, the execs didn’t want to “hurt their stock price by overpaying for an asset that traded at a much lower multiple.” Netflix’s co-CEO Greg Peters also stated, ahead of the acquisition of Warner Bros., that “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don’t have an amazing track record,” which led people to think Netflix was not interested in the deal. </p>

            <p>A listing for Resident Evil Requiem's Deluxe Edition may have given away more than Capcom intended, with the suggestion of an unexpected playable character.</p>
<p>Ever since its announcement, players have speculated that Leon Kennedy would be popping up when Requiem debuts next year, but GameStop has unintentionally added another series name to the list of possible playable characters. <strong>Please be aware of potential Resident Evil Requiem spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>As spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">DuskGolem</a>, the GameStop store page for Resident Evil Requiem's Deluxe Edition once featured exclusive content for none other than Rosemary Winters. She is the daughter of Resident Evil 7 and 8 protagonist, Ethan. And, while her inclusion has been scrubbed from the site now, the internet remembers.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, the Deluxe Edition initially promised users a Shadow Walker costume pack, which would include three outfits for Rosemary.</p>
<p>The same listing also mentioned two additional story scenarios, along with a "major" Mercenaries mode update and a Morphic Visor cosmetic filter for "Rose's visor" (oddly, they didn't say Rosemary here).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>DuskGolem via X</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>The wording has since been changed, and the <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/pc-gaming/pc-games/products/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe---pc/20023062-2a094304.html">GameStop listing</a> for the Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition now reads thus:</p>
<p><strong>The Deluxe Kit contains the following content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Five costumes including Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>
<li>Two filters including Filter: Apocalypse</li>
<li>Four weapon skins including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>
<li>Two charms including Charm: Mr. Raccoon</li>
<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>
<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>
</ul>
<p>The last time we saw Rosemary Winters was in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil 8</a>'s Shadows of Rose DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-village-dlc-trailer-reveals-roses-mysterious-power">where she appeared as a teenager with supernatural powers</a>. In 2022, director Kento Kinoshita said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-dlc-will-conclude-the-winters-family-saga">Capcom was "creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga"</a>. So, was the studio calling our bluff?</p>

<p>It's a goal!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>One of the most unique a beautiful games of the year — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> — is all about the beautiful game itself and the communities it helps build, and it's coming to Switch on <strong>11th December</strong> in North America for just <strong>$14.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Japan will get it on 18th December, while the rest of the world will have to wait for kick-off on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>despelote isn't your typical soccer game where you're kicking about a ball to win matches; this is a slice-of-life narrative-driven experience which is all about the importance of soccer to Ecuador and, in particular to eight-year-old Julián, in the run up to the World Cup.</p>
<p>In despelote, you'll dribble, pass, and shoot the ball around Quito, but not for victory — simply, to connect. How will people react? Will Ecuador qualify for the World Cup? And how does everyone feel about the beautiful game, of their city, their country?</p>
<p>It's a short game too, clocking in at around 2 hours, but from looking at reviews back when the game launched on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in May, it'll stick with you long after. Here's a rundown of what toe expect from the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Features:</u></p>
<p>- A bittersweet and sometimes dreamy semi-autobiographical tale of youth.<br>
- Explore a dense town space at your leisure, full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to.<br>
- A physics-based soccer ball that feels good to kick around in a first-person perspective.<br>
- A vibrant world full of characters that have funny, and genuine conversations.<br>
- Photos and audio recorded on location in Ecuador are used to create a strong sense of place.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/</link>
            <guid>1376203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> has, as it does each week, the latest <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> for the top-selling games in the EU. This time, the weekly sales are from the week of November 24-30, which includes all of the Black Friday sales numbers, with EA Sports FC 26 winning the day in both sales by revenue and units sold. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to stay ahead of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In fairness, both of fall 2025's popular shooters were in the top five for the week, with Black Ops 7 riding its launch wave and Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-amazon/">getting put on a fairly significant Black Friday sale</a>, though the discount <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-loses-ground-eu-sales-charts-black-friday-sales/">wasn't enough to change the rankings from the week before</a>, with Black Ops 7 still holding fast just above Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was another notable entry in the charts. Even though it came in eighth place on the sales by revenue chart, it shot up all the way to second place in the units sold chart, beating Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 rounded out the top five units sold list, while on the revenue charts, after Battlefield 6 in third, Pokémon Legends Z-A and NBA 2K26 rounded out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>



<p>None of the entries in the revenue chart or units sold chart were brand new releases, with everyone taking advantage of Black Friday sales to pick up older games they had been eyeing. In fact, the most recent release on both charts was technically Black Ops 7, since it's the only game on either top ten list that released in November 2025.</p>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by units sold for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>
</ol>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by revenue for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>

<li>Battlefield 6</li>

<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</li>
</ol>



<p>Elsewhere in The Game Business' report, on the hardware side of things per NielsenIQ, it was the PlayStation 5, not the Nintendo Switch 2, that was the hottest hardware item of the week. Not that the Switch 2 was a slouch, but significant discounts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-available-at-lowest-price-of-648-99-on-amazon-despite-sale-period-ended/">on the PS5 Pro</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-takes-100-off-ps5-for-black-friday-sales/"> base PS5 models</a> helped push it to be, according to The Game Business, the only console to actually improve on its sales numbers compared to last year.</p>



<p>Overall, not the most surprising Black Friday sales charts. Popular sports games and first-person shooters are at the top of the charts, with the rest of the list filled up by regulars on the charts like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<p>Though you do wonder if Microsoft continues to change how it delivers its games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-xbox-exec-says-microsoft-would-be-delighted-to-avoid-making-hardware-and-delivering-games-netflix-style/">particularly if it goes full-on into the Netflix-style distribution as former executive Peter Moore suggested</a>, will Call of Duty or any other Microsoft-owned game still make these charts, or will the subscription-based focus leave a gap for other games to claim a spot as one of the regularly best-selling games week-to-week?</p>

            <p>The modders behind <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">modding</a> project aiming to add a post-Oblivion-crisis version of the Imperial province to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s map, have given a lengthy tour of the latest city they've whipped into shape. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-skyrim-cyrodiil-the-full-imperial-expansion-from-the-devs-of-skyrims-massive-bruma-mod-gets-a-bird-chatter-heavy-teaser">teased the other week</a>, that city is Anvil, and it's certainly home to some quirky folks.</p>
<p>Just in case of confusion, what makes Beyond Skyrim different to both Bethesda's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and recently delayed Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> is that it'll be introducing a fresh cast of characters and stories to familiar locations from the fourth Elder Scrolls game. After all, by the time of Skyrim, Martin Septim and his contemporaries are long gone.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that existing Skyrim map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> offers a great early taste of what this group of modders can pull off, what's intrigued me most so far is the project's mission to wind forward time and tell new tales. After all, Oblivion's a nice game to retread, but I've seen the narrative it has to offer plenty of times at this point.</p><p>However, having watched a good chunk of that livestream embedded above, where the Beyond Skyrim team show off some of the stories and characters they've worked into Anvil, my feelings are a bit mixed. The city itself looks brilliant, having been expanded and given an architectural feel which blends Cyrodiilic vibes with the deserty aesthetic of neighbouring province Hammerfell.</p>
<p>The layout still invokes plenty of nostalgia, while Beyond Skyrim's team look to have arguably leant more towards zany comedy with the side characters and quests who pop up to newcomers than the notoriously eccentric Oblivion did. Upon first entering the city, you come across and encounter with two drunken sailors swimming in the town's pod. A guard jumps in to arrest them, and these two loinclothed lads sprint off through the city; according to the devs, the idea is that you might pursue their nearly-bare bottoms and do some sightseeing. Or, maybe you'll move on and talk to an Argonian named Left-Hand who randomly demands you tell him what 4833 x 76 is.</p>
<p>Maelorn, an older version of one of the two elven twins you might remember from Oblivion, is less on the weird side, since he just asks you a riddle and then reminisces about his life since the days of The Elder Scrolls 4.</p>
<p>Anyway, what grabbed my attention the most was a quest involving a kid called Jinol, which kicks off in Anvil bazaar about half an hour in. It's simply called Child Labour, and is about, er, that. Jinol wants your help setting up a business selling saltwater from the docks door-to-door, so you recruit other kids to act as runners. So far, so quirky little quest in terms of premise. The idea's that you gradually realise that you maybe shouldn't just be going along with trying to make a buck off some kids doing work an adult should be doing, at least if the Elder Scrolls' world is being kept a bit more on the 'fantasy' side of the 'medieval fantasy' coin.</p><p>There is one character, a merchant named Pavia Tara, who calls you out and asks if you've considered the ethics of your actions. However, at the moment the modders seem to have reduced her to being a one-dimensional scolding Karen, even if she does weave a bit of small business vs big business chatter into her rant, mirroring the city's wider themes.</p>
<p>There's a spot of tonal whiplash there, alongside the quest's very on-the-nose name. Then, we meet Franny. Basically, you and Jinol go and meet the owner of a big fishing company, Francis of Anvil. He lives with multiple wives in a house the devs say was at least in part inspired by the Playboy mansion. Franny literally goes "Child labour, why didn't I think of that", and offers to buy out Jinol's business. You help the kid decide whether or not this grown, multiple-wife guy gets to save money by relying on child labour.</p>
<p>The quest is mostly played for laughs, and I certainly don't think the goal is to make light of what remains <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour">a real issue</a> in our own world. Plus, the modders have aimed to make the kids essentially act like mini-adults. However, I'm not sure the quest strikes an effective balance between wacky/edgy humour, and making the player confront the morals behind what starts out as innocent fun.</p>
<p>As things go, it hasn't put me off Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil entirely – I’m still keen to see what other sorts of tales the modders have weaved into their work. But it wouldn’t be the first time a mod has mishandled controversial or delicate themes in an attempt at crafting fresh narratives, and while Jinol’s water distribution service isn’t anywhere near the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-the-frontier-goes-offline-after-modder-accused-of-sharing-animated-paedophilic-content">worst examples</a>, it is something I hope gets revisited. Maybe when they go back to swap all the placeholder AI voices for real ones.</p>

            <guid>1376188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

         <p><span>Fans have a theory that this decline in writing quality may have come from a Netflix mandate. In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>The Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 release date carries on Epic’s new mission to let everyone relive the early years by experiencing older content again from top to bottom. Key content for Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 has been revealed, showing you what you can look forward to for several weeks.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 celebrates the battle royale’s Christmas period from SEVEN years ago. The game has changed dramatically over the last seven years, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-dark-voyager-quest-rewards-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</a> begins the next significant milestone in the game’s history, it’s time for a Holiday throwback.</p>



<p>OG Chapter 1 Season 7 brings back some banging skins and some beloved POIs and weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 releases on December 11, exactly two weeks out from Christmas Day!</strong></p>



<p>It’s time to put in some real work. Alongside Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is OG Chapter 1 Season 7. It’s a testament to Epic to keep so many areas of the game in operation at once. But the nostalgic return to bygone Fortnite eras has been a huge dub in the community.</p>



<p>The OG Chapter 1 Season 7’s tagline was “You Better Watch Out,” and Insider Gaming will tell you why.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tigz, who was documented last week as being the first person in the world to successfully escape from Tarkov, has been awarded a unique streamer item by Battlestate Games. These items are used to represent the respect that Battlestate Games has for the content creators who pour their lives into pulling Escape from Tarkov into the limelight time and again.</p>



<p>There are dozens of streamer items in the game, but the latest one belongs to Tigz, and it’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the failed runs that prevented him from getting out of Tarkov without too many issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-tigz-has-a-streamer-item">Tigz Has a Streamer Item</h2>



<p>Tigz has a unique streamer item that’s reminiscent of his time spent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">escaping through Terminal</a>, the final map in Battlestate Games’ tough extraction shooter. In his first attempt, which was watched by tens of thousands of people, Tigz fell short of the ending after failing to find a splint to patch an injury that ultimately led to his death.</p>



<p>That forced him to try again, numerous times.</p>



<p>To honor and recognize that moment, Battlestate Games created a unique <strong>splint </strong>for Tigz’s streamer item – <strong>Tigzresq</strong>. It’s a <strong>67-inch </strong>splint in a red and black design that may or may not be practical. <span>Streamer items&nbsp;<strong>are rarely</strong></span><strong> </strong>practical, but if any will have an honest, in-game use, it’s the Tigzresq.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another streamer item with a practical use is Gingy’s keychain, which does what you’d imagine and holds keys. There’s also WillerZ’s wallet, the RatCola, sprats, and a jar of mayo, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Whenever someone becomes big for streaming Escape from Tarkov, their streamer item is never too far behind. Fans of TheBurntPeanut, who recently won awards at The Streamer Awards, are clamouring for a unique item in Escape from Tarkov, given the amount of time the VTuber (sorry, PTuber) has spent in the game in recent years.</p>



<p>If you had a streamer item in Escape from Tarkov, what would it be? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
