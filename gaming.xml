<p>With the VCT 2025 season just beyond the horizon, many esports teams are preparing their Valorant rosters. With teams like Sentinels and NRG already revealing their teams, many other organizations are scurrying to get their rosters announced. Among these teams is T1, who recently began revealing their 2025 Valorant roster for the upcoming VCT season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-t1-begins-announcing-vct-2025-roster">T1 Begins Announcing VCT 2025 Roster</h2>



<p>With the 2024 season wrapping up just over a month ago, many Valorant vans are itching for more action. Luckily, with only a few months left in the year, we should all be getting our Valorant fix very shortly. </p>



<p>And now, we are learning just who will be playing for what teams during the 2025 VCT season. </p>



<p>T1, who has had a rough history within the Valorant scene, is looking to up their game going into 2025. With their last first-place being back in 2022 at the NSG: Summer Championship – Open 2 event, the team is looking for a hail mary going into 2025. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Well, it looks like the team’s roster for next year’s season is stacked, as the esports organization has slowly been announcing everyone on Twitter over the last week.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-full-t1-2025-valorant-roster">Full T1 2025 Valorant Roster</h3>



<p>With some of the top South Korean Valorant players announced for T1’s newest roster, fans are getting amped up to see how the team performs in the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>T1 2025 Roster:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Meteor (Player)</li>



<li>Sylvan (Player)</li>



<li>Indigo (Coach)</li>



<li>CheongGak (Coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>As of now, this is all we know, but the team continues to update their Twitter almost daily with new announcements. By the end of next week, we should have the entire team revealed. It seems, though, as if T1 is preparing to go all out for 2025.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles is a new game mode where players can explore some never-before-seen storylines for their favourite characters. These storylines vastly differ from the events in the anime or manga. In this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide, we will go through all the different branching storylines and alternate endings for Gohan in the Buu Saga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles feature two types of branches; some are complete storylines, whereas others are alternate endings. Completing a whole storyline rewards you with 100,000 Zeni, a bunch of XP and some items. This guide explains all you need to know about Gohan’s branching storylines in the Buu Saga and how to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-dependable-son">A Dependable Son</h2>



<p>In Gohan’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode battles, players are offered a choice at the beginning of the Buu Saga. The choice is offered when Spopovich is battering Videl, and Gohan has to either choose to ‘Stay Calm’ or ‘Step in’ to protect. However, no matter your decision, the game mode will follow the canon storyline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real choice arrives when Gohan battles Dabura in the Majin Buu arc. Leading up to this fight, Gohan is constantly reminded how far back he has fallen. Vegeta also says that he could knock Gohan out in his sleep. Eager to prove his worth, Gohan takes on Dabura alone. You must defeat Dabura before the match ends to trigger A Dependable Son ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you manage to trigger it, Gohan unleashes his true power and defeats Dabura. Left with no allies, Babidi is defeated, and Buu is never revived. The Z Warriors can go about their lives peacefully. However, Goku wants to go a few rounds against Gohan to test his strength.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-stronger-than-the-strongest">Stronger than the Strongest</h2>



<p>This is another alternate Buu Saga ending for Gohan in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. The Stronger than the Strongest path for Gohan can be unlocked during the Lust for Power mission. Buu has absorbed Gotenks in this battle and shifted his focus to Gohan. You must defeat Buu before the time ends to unlock the secret ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new scenario, Buu loses power once Gotenks’ fusion wears off and now seeks to absorb Gohan. Gohan is weary of Buu’s tactics and avoids being absorbed. He then fights with his whole strength and defeats Buu, restoring peace on Earth. In this scenario, Goku and Vegeta do not need to intervene, and we do not see the Vegito fusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players should know that there are two types of branches in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles; some are complete storylines, whereas others are just alternate endings.

<h2 id="h-peace-reclaimed">Peace Reclaimed</h2>



<p>In the Cell Saga, Gohan’s Episode Battles only have one alternate ending, which players can unlock during the Unleased Rage mission. Players will need to defeat Cell quickly to trigger the Peace Reclaimed ending. To know if you’ve triggered this ending, pay attention to Cell’s Dialogue during battles; they will change if Gohan is quick enough while inflicting damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you pull it off, Gohan will enter a frenzy after seeing Cell Jr hurt his loved ones. He instantly vaporises Cell Jr. and then goes after Cell. This time, Gohan doesn’t let his guard down and finishes Cell before he can pull any dirty tricks. This means Goku doesn’t have to die, and the Father and Son can return home peacefully.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-is-gohan-black-playable-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Is Gohan Black Playable in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero?</h2>



<p>The answer to this question is no, Gohan Black is not a playable character in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. However, you battle this character several times during Gohan’s alternate storyline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-strongest-warrior-nbsp">The Strongest Warrior&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gohan’s alternate path in the Super Saga is unlockable when you must defend the Earth from the Frieza Force. During this mission, players must beat the Frieza Soldier quickly and then corner Frieza. You must pummel Frieza with a flurry of attacks until he acknowledges Gohan’s fighting potential.</p>



<p>If Frieza acknowledges Gohan, the Strongest Warrior path will be unlocked, and there will be a new Sparking! Episode plays. In this episode, Gohan’s battle instincts kick in, and his Potential is unlocked again. At the same time, Frieza chooses to showcase his Golden Form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you defeat Frieza here, Goku and Vegeta will never arrive on Earth to save the day. However, Gohan still feels he has become weak over the years and asks Piccolo to train him. He also visits the Land of the Kai’s to have Kais train his other abilities.</p>

<h2 id="h-gohan-s-growth-nbsp">Gohan’s Growth&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Due to this training, Gohan is strong enough to participate in the Universe 6 vs Universe 7 tournament, where his matchup is against the Legendary Hitman, Hit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The battle between the two juggernauts, Hit and Gohan, becomes a sensation across the other Universes, with many Supreme Kais gaining interest in Gohan. Even Vegeta acknowledges Gohan’s power jump after seeing his performance in the Tournament.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-change-in-timeline-nbsp">A Change in Timeline&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Due to Gohan’s growth, the timeline changes even further. In this new timeline, Future Trunks returns to Earth and meets Gohan instead of Goku, like in the canon series of events. This is when a new Sparking Episode plays.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-here-comes-black-gohan">Here Comes Black Gohan</h2>



<p>The new Sparking Episode starts with one of the most hype scenes in the game. Black Gohan has arrived in pursuit of Future Trunks and is now facing Gohan. You must fight Black Gohan until he is warped back to his timeline to complete this mission. Black Gohan has taken Black Goku’s place in this branching path and has brought Future Trunks’ timeline to the brink of destruction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following events of this timeline are similar to those in the canon, except Gohan has replaced Goku as the protagonist. In this branching path, Gohan, Vegeta and Goku travel to the future to confront Black Gohan with Future Trunks. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-training-with-piccolo-nbsp">Training with Piccolo&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gohan is overwhelmed by Zamasu and Black Gohan’s strength and returns to the present time just like canon events. However, this time, Piccolo teaches Gohan the Evil Containment Wave while motivating him to save the future timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trio returns to the future as they face Zamasu and Black Gohan. Fused Zamasu is created as the father-son combinations (Goku/Gohan and Vegeta/Trunks) give it all to battle against this immortal enemy. You must bring Fused Zamasu’s health down until the match ends during this scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-sons-take-up-the-mantle-nbsp">The Sons Take up the Mantle&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Zamasu’s body starts disintegrating, and he is hit with a Father-Son Kamehameha. Goku and Vegeta get gassed out after this attack, and it is now up to the sons, Trunks and Gohan, to finish the job. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You battle Fused Zamasu one last time, and that’s the last fight on this branching path. A new Sparking! Episode plays where Gohan and Trunks use a Dual Masenko to stagger Fused Zamasu. Then Gohan uses the Evil Containment Wave to finish the job, as there’s no Zeno to save the day this time.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I no longer expect video games that tackle the subjects of racism and discrimination through fantasy — as <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does — to surprise me. Those stories never go beyond well-trodden depictions of “racism is bad,” and I tune them out like so much white noise. But <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has done the work, and its willingness to go beyond surface-level treatments of tired fantasy tropes to dig at the heart of the real issues with racism and discrimination is exactly what makes it a phenomenal game. <em>Metaphor</em> is a clever evolution of the <em>Persona</em> series, but it wouldn’t be as interesting or outstanding as it is without its refreshingly progressive message.</p><p><em>Metaphor </em>takes place in a world where our reality of “equality” between different ethnic groups is presented as an unattainable-but-nice-to-think-about idyllic fantasy, while discrimination, classism, and the struggle against monstrous creatures called “humans” rule the day.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>In </em>Metaphor<em>, society is arranged into a racial hierarchy based on different fantastical physical features... or lack thereof.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The world of <em>Metaphor</em> is stratified according to a hierarchy of different tribes classified by their physical characteristics, like wings, horns, or elfin-like long ears. Then there’s the protagonist, who comes from the most hated tribe, which, to our eyes, resemble real-world humans with no distinct physical features. Atlus calling this game “Metaphor” is about as unsubtle as a brick thrown at a protest.</p><div><p>As I dive into the guts of what makes <em>Metaphor</em> so great, I do have to note the frequent issues I had with instability. I played the game on Xbox Series S and experienced numerous crashes that seemed related to the game’s autosave feature. On top of that, when the game did crash and I rebooted my Xbox to start over, the game frequently reloaded without a video input. I could hear the start menu music but see nothing, requiring me to end my gaming sessions prematurely as the issue only seemed to fix itself after an overnight break. You can read more about <em>Metaphor</em>’s technical performance <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">in <em>Eurogamer</em>’s review</a>.</p></div><p>The world is thrown into chaos when the dogmatic king is murdered, leaving behind no heir, as his idealistic son mysteriously vanished years before. His death triggers a nationwide contest whereby anyone, no matter their birth or circumstance, can compete to win the throne, provided they have the love and support of the people. Your job is to earn that love through a variety of contests in the hope of putting that idealistic prince on the throne so that he may change this hateful racist world for the better.</p><p>In <em>Metaphor</em>, the characters utilize a job class system called archetypes. Each party member starts with a specific archetype — warrior, healer, mage, etc. — and by developing relationships with other NPCs, unlock more. Like <em>Persona</em>, combat is centered on exploiting an enemy’s weakness while mitigating your own. There’s also an absolutely fabulous overworld combat feature where if you strike a weaker enemy, they simply die, forgoing a transition into a battle scene. However, if an enemy is your level or stronger, you can use overworld combat to surprise attack and weaken them, giving you a serious advantage in the fight to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The slick menus of </em>Persona-<em>series fame return.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>I adore these improvements over <em>Persona</em>’s combat because it significantly cuts down on the time needed to grind experience. It also makes combat <em>harrowing as hell</em> because while you’re able to ambush monsters, they can do the same to you. <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat excels, exceeding its RPG cohort, because it demands that I think more strategically. Arrogantly running around a dungeon or into boss fights with your biggest, highest-level guns blazing is not always the winning strategy, and it’s also a good way to get you killed.</p><p>My higher-level party was frequently wiped out by an enemy I’d otherwise mop the floor with simply because they got the drop on me. Conversely, I’ve been able to soundly defeat enemies eight and nine levels higher than me with freshly unlocked level-one archetypes because their special abilities were uniquely suited to exploit a weakness. <em>Metaphor</em> is the only single-player game that made me feel like a raid leader in an MMO like <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> also feels good from a tactile perspective. The animations that play as you fluidly zip between different options in combat add a kinetic energy that made me feel like I was playing an action game instead of a turn-based RPG. This experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">the slick-as-hell, highly stylized menus</a> and the <em>killer</em> soundtrack — especially the main battle music. I don’t know what that man is saying, but the way he says it gets me hype as hell.</p><p>But <em>Metaphor</em> is more than just a stylish, dynamic RPG — it’s also the rare fantasy story that tackles discrimination with nuance.</p><p>In a lot of fantasy, I’m annoyed by the storytelling conceit of using discrimination against fantasy races as an allegory for real-world racism. Stories featuring this trope usually stop at the “racism is bad” surface level, demonstrating that with ugly over-the-top displays of violence (hey there, <em>Dragon Age</em>) while ignoring the subtleties that make racism so heinous and pervasive. <em>Metaphor </em>manages to incorporate and tackle both aspects of this reality.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>“Rich people are corrupt” is a sentiment frequently expressed in video games but rarely so... pointedly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>There’s a moment when you’re reading a fantasy book with a companion, and they mention that realizing their goal of a world where everyone is treated equally won’t be enough. “Equal competition doesn’t mean equal footing,” Heismay says. It’s the first time I’ve seen a video game acknowledge that simply stopping the big bad evil racist won’t magically make up for the countless generations of oppression. The game does the same with class and wealth. There’s a character vying for the throne who wishes to essentially “eat the rich” and redistribute their wealth at the point of a guillotine. But by virtue of her extremely low status, she sees everybody with more than a few coins to rub together as her ideological enemy. It’s just like when people in poverty lash out at other people a little bit less in poverty when their real enemies are the wealthy powerholders who exploit that animosity. It’s awesome that the game calls that out.</p><p>There’s an almost reflexive instinct to call <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> “<em>Persona</em> with swords.” The game has the hallmarks of a <em>Persona,</em> which lend it an air of familiarity, not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona">much of the same creative talent</a>. But this characterization doesn’t feel correct. Those familiar systems have been remixed to feel fresh while the game’s message is vibrating on levels the <em>Persona</em> games brush up against but never quite reach.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Heismay says, “Diversity, equality, </em>and<em> inclusion.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The upsetting thing about racism, classism, homophobia, and the like is that there’s a reluctance in the real world to acknowledge that it’s not only the violence of individual actors that perpetuates this oppression but institutions and systems as well. We challenge those individual actors and call them out because that’s much easier and quicker to do than the difficult generational work it takes to dismantle racist systems and build equitable ones. Games with that kind of message do the same — ending with the climactic defeat of the bad guys. <em>Metaphor</em> is one of the first times a high-profile game acknowledges the real, much harder, and less glamorous work of dismantling systems.</p><p>And at a time when you can’t even call out the individual actors anymore without getting gaslit to hell and back — it’s moving, as a person of color, to see <em>Metaphor</em> go the extra mile to say, “These systems need to go, too.” That’s what makes <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> so powerful, resonant, and in every sense of a word that’s unfortunately been bastardized into meaninglessness, woke as fuck.</p><p><small><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-director-reveals-secret-to-atlus-games-metaphor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Katsura Hashino knows exactly what he wants when it comes to video games. The legendary game director, who is responsible for the modern Persona games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">more recently Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, believes that, in a world obsessed with pixel count and frame-rates, only one thing matters: the people who made it. </p><p>“I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it. [I want to know] who created it and for it to give me a glimpse of the emotion that inspired it,” he explains.</p><p>It’s a philosophy that has served him well over the past 30 years and it’s one of the reasons the Persona games have such a devout following. Yes, the art direction is impeccable, as is the attention to detail, even down to the UI, but it’s the characters who populate this fantastical series that really make a difference. Chie, Junpei, Ann… They all feel like real people, with traits and emotions we can relate to, so much so they feel like old friends rather than characters from a video game. That’s entirely intentional and it’s what drives Hashino to make games – a personal approach that runs counter to some of the bigger projects out there that are required to meet the expectations of both fans and company shareholders alike.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it.</p></div><p>Hashino is a longtime director at Atlus, having worked on several of the company’s Shin Megami Tensei games, the much-loved RPG series that merges the occult with more grounded settings. In a world dominated by ‘traditional’ Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, they’re a sort of goth alternative that has steadily grown in popularity over the years. </p><p>He took over the Persona series starting with Persona 3, following the departure of the previous Persona director Kouji Okada. Hashino brought over some of the darker themes from Shin Megami Tensei and mixed them with Persona’s more stylish pop vibe, resulting in a vibrant anime-influenced aesthetic, set against a high school backdrop that grappled with mythic ideas like gods and demons, as well as psychology. It’s a series that has established Hashino as one of gaming’s most respected directors. On the eve of his latest game, Metaphor: ReFantazio, IGN sat down with Hashino to look back at his past work and what drives him to make games. </p><p>Persona 3 catapulted the series into mass popularity and coincided with a renewed interest in anime in North America. However, despite its cartoon visuals there’s a lot of depth to the game and, importantly, the characters, as Hashino explains: “I think the gap between the kind of realism of the characters themselves and the anime aesthetic is a really interesting and important part of the game. You might first look and see these very anime-style characters and this anime-style world, but then might be surprised and interested to see there’s a very real [world] underpinning to them. Looking beyond the anime and seeing the realism is really a wonderful part of our games.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me</p></div><p>This realism – the effort Hashino and his team goes to, to ensure every character feels real – is what drives every decision in the design process, from broad ideas to specific dialogue, as Hasino explains: “There’s this little girl named Nanako [in Persona 4] who’s in elementary school. When we were first writing her dialogue, we wrote [it] to be really, really cute. But then we took a step back and thought, ‘Wait a minute, all of her lines are so cute and they’re so well done that it doesn’t feel like any actual human girl would [talk like that] at that age’. It just felt like too much.”</p><p>Rather than lean into the fact Nanako is a video game character and thus might have dialogue that doesn’t sound truly authentic, Hashino and his team went back to the writers’ room. “We started cutting back on those overly cutesy dialogues and tried to root it in reality instead. So even though Persona 4 is a modern fantasy game, we wanted it to feel closer to something that could be happening next door to you.”</p><p>One thing that becomes clear when speaking with Hashino is the love he has for the well-being of the characters in his games. When discussing his favorite moment in Persona 5, he tells us it’s when the cast of characters are able to hang out in the retro-style cafe in Shibuya that the Phantom Thieves make their hideout.</p><p>“In Persona 5, a lot of the characters don’t really have a place where they feel safe,” Hashino explains. “So I wanted to find a place where they can go and just really have that sense of security. And in Shibuya [a neighborhood in Tokyo] it’s really hard to find that location. There’s lots of roads, lots of corridors, but there’s not really a place where [you think], ‘Okay, you guys can just sit here and chill out and just use it as your base’. Finding a place [where] they’d be welcome is really difficult. So for the characters in Persona 5, I was trying to give them a place where they <em>would</em> be welcome. That’s when I came up with the idea of what we call in Japan a <em>junkissa</em>, which is an old-style cafe.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Hashino’s love for the characters he creates is something that’s echoed by fans, and even though Metaphor: ReFantazio steps away from the familiar Persona setting – it’s set in a new, fantasy world rather than Tokyo – it has a lot in common with the games he’s made before. Similarly, the characters you’ll meet in Metaphor, despite being different from the Phantom Thieves we’re familiar with, are faced with many of the same emotional pressures such as prejudice, fear, and anxiety.</p><p>“Metaphor is a game where the characters are around teenage age, but they’re not facing [traditional] teenager problems,” Hashino says, inferring that the characters you meet will struggle with a lot more than typical teen drama like peer pressure and romance. “They’re facing anxiety and all these other big things that affect everybody, no matter who they are, where they are, or how old they are.” So while Metaphor: ReFantazio presents a new world with new characters, many of its themes can be found in Hashino’s other games.</p><p>Indeed, whether it’s Persona, Shin Megami Tensei or Metaphor, getting under the skin of each character is core to the experience. It’s something Hashino believes comes from the people who make the games, and that he prefers projects in which you can see a developer’s true self: “I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me — it doesn’t really interest me”, he admits, bluntly. “But when I see these sorts of games [which reveal a little about the people that made them], it really fills me with the motivation to keep developing,” he says. “That these artists, these creatives, had something they really wanted to say is where I get all of my inspiration from, and the drive to continue to be creative myself.”</p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

The minute-long video is just as sphincter clenching as you’d expect. It shows the Cybertruck rolling out to the Terminator theme music. For some reason there’s smoke for the Cybertruck to drive through  before the truck stops and is joined by Irvine Police officers who awkwardly pose with the truck, complete with cyborg-like smiles. The video ends with custom thunder and lightning graphics created for the truck that reads “Irvine Police Cybertruck.” I guess we’re all supposed to go “hell yeah!” at that point.<br></p><p>Irvine Police are doubling down on the department’s reasoning for spending well over six figures on this electric pickup. In the video description, the department says the truck is for community engagement, specifically for officer support with the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program.<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The truck will support our Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program and community outreach efforts. While the fully equipped vehicle won’t be used as a patrol car, it can respond to emergencies and assist the community when needed. For over three decades, our DARE officers have driven attention-grabbing and one-of-a-kind vehicles that never fail to turn heads and excite students.</p></blockquote><p>Despite the department saying that this will be for community engagement, the truck has been divisive. Back in September, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://jalopnik.com/southern-california-police-departments-expensive-cybert-1851656133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jalopnik.com/southern-california-police-departments-expensive-cybert-1851656133">public records</a></span> showed the department dropped over $150,000 on the electric truck. Things didn’t look much better when it was also revealed that the department attempted to keep the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://irvinewatchdog.org/city-hall/public-records-reveal-irvine-police-spent-153175-on-tesla-cybertruck-sparking-community-concerns-over-transparency-and-financial-accountability-in-the-irvine-police-department/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://irvinewatchdog.org/city-hall/public-records-reveal-irvine-police-spent-153175-on-tesla-cybertruck-sparking-community-concerns-over-transparency-and-financial-accountability-in-the-irvine-police-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exact purchase amount secret</a></span>. And not everyone is buying the department’s reasoning that the truck is for community engagement. Some experts believe the money spent on the Cybertruck and its law enforcement modifications should have been actually spent on, you know, the community. </p><p>The truck being a part of the DARE program doesn’t help things either. As Gizmodo pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a></span> the program does not work. It also doesn’t look as if Irvine PD actually got proper licensing to use “The Terminator” music in the video; the department mentioned in a statement to Gizmodo that “The video was used on our socials and music credit was given to the artist.” Between the public backlash, this cringe video and a possible copyright violation, it looks like this Cybertruck is already turning out to be less of a plus for the department and more of a headache. <br></p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Wednesday, October 9.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When it comes to movies, the summer was packed with the likes of <em>Cuckoo</em>, <em>MaXXXine</em>, and <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, while gaming has seen releases such as a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and the retro <em>Crow Country</em>. So, if you’re looking for something new to play or watch in the lead-up to Halloween, we’ve gathered all of our spookiest coverage here in one place to make things a little easier. (And if you missed it, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23911556/halloween-2023-games-movies-tv-streaming-recommendations">we did the same thing last year</a>.) So, grab some snacks, turn down the lights, and get ready for a few scares.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-342a0577-688e-4c95-957b-657e953287f4"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240464/the-substance-review">The Substance is a grotesque takedown of our obsession with youth</a></h2><p>As much as studios love hyping up their latest scary movies as being so terrifying that they traumatize audiences, it is rare for features to live up to that kind of buzz. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/8/24238342/the-substance"><em>The Substance</em></a><em> </em>writer / director Coralie Fargeat’s new body horror is infinitely more disturbing (a feature, not a bug) than any of its early trailers have let on.&nbsp;</p><p>Films about the agony of living up to female beauty standards aren’t new, but <em>The Substance </em>weaves them into an incisive feminist parable that feels jacked directly into the moment that has given us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160884/hims-hers-ozempic-weight-loss-wegovy-pharmacy">on-demand Ozempic</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203547/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign-charli-xcx-brat-summer-meme"><em>Brat</em></a><em>. </em>And what the film lacks in subtlety, it makes up for with an inspired — if stomach-turning — story that’s meant to get all the way under your skin, no matter how secure in your body you might feel.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240464/the-substance-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-c4f4a714-3616-42c7-8041-2f3ecd3c8ec7"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review">Alien: Romulus is a solid franchise tribute plagued by weird optics</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: 20th Century Studios</cite></p></figure></div><p>It’s mind-boggling that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24170776/alien-romulus-trailer-release-date"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a> almost wound up <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/alien-movie-fede-alvarez-20th-century-studios-1235037155/">debuting on Hulu</a> instead of theaters. The film’s intricate set design alone makes it one of the series’ most visually impressive chapters, and its practical effects are a welcome change of pace in a summer blockbuster season that has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24218046/deadpool-wolverine-is-in-the-billion-dollar-club">dominated</a> by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161853/furiosa-mad-max-review">uninspired CGI spectacle</a>.</p><p>Director Fede Álvarez’s new standalone entry in the long-running sci-fi / horror franchise feels especially primed to speak to a new generation of fans. But as fun as <em>Romulus </em>is to look at, its story plays more like a compilation of the <em>Alien </em>series’ greatest hits than a movie that’s trying to sing its own tune. And the few new ideas <em>Romulus </em>does bring to the table are undercut by its insistence on leaning into some very questionable optics.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1bd3d180-1112-40d7-b610-ef4c41881805"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216922/horror-movies-maxxxine-longlegs-cuckoo-nothing-to-say">Horror movies need to be more than a big mood</a></h2><p>The release of <em>Get Out </em>in 2017 disturbed Hollywood — not just the box office but, briefly, the entire horror genre, which had long been the most consistent moneymaker in the industry. The film made a multiple of 56 times on its $4.5 million budget and was less a breakthrough and more of a victory lap for Blumhouse, the studio that had for nearly two decades championed scary movies at a low cost with hopes of a high return.</p><p>Partly, <em>Get Out</em> was exceptional — not the first movie where the true horror is racism, but one that balanced the terror with humor and absurdity. Eager to repeat that success, Hollywood greenlit a swath of horror movies about racism. Many of them were underwhelming and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/antebellum-movie-review-i-am-tired-of-films-like-this.html">appalling</a>. Mostly, it was exhausting to see so much repetition in a genre that thrives on novelty. But at least these movies were <em>about</em> something. Now we’re onto the next wave of horror films, which have trended toward being about nothing.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216922/horror-movies-maxxxine-longlegs-cuckoo-nothing-to-say">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-94413712-7afd-4b0a-b402-4fa052e067bc"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24215555/neon-cuckoo-review">Cuckoo is a picturesque nightmare that struggles to get its point across</a></h2><p>Coming on the heels of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24199318/longlegs-ending-explained-questions-oz-perkinsk"><em>Longlegs</em></a> and <em>Immaculate</em>, director Tilman Singer’s <em>Cuckoo </em>feels like the next phase of Neon’s plan to dominate this summer of horror. The movie’s haunting atmosphere and gorgeous cinematography make it seem primed to tap into Hollywood’s current obsession with unsettling features running on spooky vibes alone. But for all of its hype and a solid performance from its leads, <em>Cuckoo</em> suffers from a lack of thematic coherence. It’s definitely the strongest of Neon’s recent scary movies, but that isn’t exactly a high bar to clear.</p><p>Set in a corner of the German Alps where few foreigners tend to wander, <em>Cuckoo</em> follows as sullen, American teenager Gretchen (Hunter Schafer) is forced to move in with her estranged father, Luis (Marton Csokas), and his new family. With all of Gretchen’s beloved bandmates and treasured possessions back in the States, she can’t help but feel alone living with her stepmother Beth (Jessica Henwick) and mute half-sister Alma (Mila Lieu). And while Gretchen doesn’t try to hide her distaste at being uprooted for Luis’ job expanding a secluded resort owned by Herr König (Dan Stevens), she only feels comfortable expressing the depths of her sadness in voicemails to her unseen mother.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24215555/neon-cuckoo-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-96f4fc9e-9ce6-4d4e-b35a-b4edbd82d836"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24187551/maxxxine-review-ti-west">A24’s MaXXXine flips the script to give you something fresh to scream about</a></h2><p>With <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22979890/x-review-ti-west-horror-movie"><em>X</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022"><em>Pearl</em></a>, it was hard to miss that Ti West was using pornography and horror as lenses through which to tell a story about the evolution of film. Both were explorations of how naked bodies have always been a subject of cinematic fascination, and while the movies were tonally different, they similarly spotlighted how sex has always been one of the driving forces behind the advancement of movie-making technology. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24124163/maxxxine-trailer-release-date-a24-mia-goth"><em>MaXXXine </em>enters the <em>X </em>franchise</a> knowing full well how easily it could fall victim to the threequel curse if it simply dropped its star into a new decade to fight for her life on yet another farm. And while it features plenty of callbacks to its predecessors, it switches the formula up just enough to make it feel like West has pulled off a blood-soaked hat trick.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24187551/maxxxine-review-ti-west">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-d54d29f0-bef4-44bf-a23d-58b285f03ec8"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190083/ti-west-interview-maxxxine-a24">‘MaXXXine is very different from both of them’: Ti West on closing out his X horror trilogy</a></h2><p>For the last few years, Ti West hasn’t stopped thinking about the horror villains Pearl and Maxine. Since 2020, the writer and director has been fully immersed in the genre-spanning franchise that started with the ’70s slasher flick <em>X</em> and continued with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022">the technicolor prequel <em>Pearl</em></a>, which were filmed back-to-back in New Zealand during the pandemic and released in 2022. Now things culminate with the premiere of the series’ third act, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24124163/maxxxine-trailer-release-date-a24-mia-goth">the very ’80s thriller <em>MaXXXine</em></a>. It’s been an intense process that has meant West hasn’t had much time for anything else. “It’s all such a blur at this point,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It’s been seven days a week, 12 hours a day, for four and a half years.”</p><p>The franchise was born, in part, out of practicality. West had initially only pitched <em>X</em> to the powers that be at A24 but had ideas for a bigger trilogy in the back of his mind. And after getting a cast and crew to New Zealand and building the sets, he realized he could film a lot of that work again for a prequel. “We had already spent all of this time and money building a Texas farm in New Zealand. How do we reuse it for free?” he remembers thinking. “How do we amortize all of those costs and make the movie less of a risk for A24? That’s where the idea came from from a practical standpoint.” He ended up writing the script for <em>Pearl</em> in a two-week-long flurry while in quarantine so that they could start shooting right away.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190083/ti-west-interview-maxxxine-a24">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-3cd8d11b-4330-4052-a2a9-483085c52be9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">For the director of I Saw the TV Glow, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was just the start</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Monica Schipper / Getty Images for IMDb</cite></p></figure></div><p>There is an honesty to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’</a>s depiction of growing up as a lonely, fantasy-obsessed kid in the ’90s that makes it resonate. And that’s true regardless of whether you, like writer / director Jane Schoenbrun, were a fan of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>.</p><p>The film’s mind-bending story centers on Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine). The two outsiders spark an unlikely friendship over their shared love of <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, a fictional fantasy / horror series that feels like a twisted mashup of <em>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete </em>and <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark? </em>Between its angsty, lo-fi atmosphere and pivots into explicit B-movie horror, almost every frame speaks to how large an impact <em>Buffy</em> had on Schoenbrun’s young imagination. But you can also hear Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.queergeektheory.org/2009/04/eve-kosofsky-sedgwick-1950-2009/">channeling the ideas</a> of queer theorists like <a href="https://queertheoryvisualculture.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sedgwick_queerperformativity.pdf">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick</a> as the film explores what it really means to see one’s self in fiction.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-02b82cbb-6a99-4dc5-9a47-27fdc5ff2b31"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc">Hellblade II’s stunning world is alive with horror</a></h2><p>Traversing the nightmare realms of the human mind has always been central to horror. The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6bbb6b61-13b0-46e0-936e-5bfa71151366"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Crow Country is a gloriously grimy revival of ’90s survival horror</a></h2><p>Even as modern horror games become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">unnervingly immersive</a>, there’s still a place for the particular mood of old-school survival horror. Through a combo of grimy visuals, cryptic puzzles, slow pacing, and clunky controls, PlayStation-era games like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> were able to create a distinct kind of tension and terror. <em>Crow Country</em> is what would happen if that kind of game never went out of style. It has the look and feel of the classics but with just the right amount of modern flourish. It’s a perfect bite of classic horror.</p><p><em>Crow Country</em> comes from indie studio SFB Games — led by brothers Tom and Adam Vian — which has so far managed to create quite the eclectic library of releases. There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633946/snipperclips-plus-nintendo-switch-interview">the playful Switch launch title <em>Snipperclips</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917268/apple-arcade-tangle-tower-localization-translation">the point-and-click murder mystery <em>Tangle Tower</em></a>, and now a dark survival horror game. <em>Crow Country</em> doesn’t just evoke the <strong>’</strong>90s&nbsp;— it’s set during the period as well. The entire game takes place in an abandoned Atlanta amusement park in 1990, as a woman named Mara sets out in search of the park’s elusive owner who mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the place is teeming with monsters and mystery.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-a61f2bbf-e1b8-49ed-941b-676f935ec39b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24">I Saw the TV Glow is a tribute to the transformative power of fandom</a></h2><p>Discovering and latching on to pieces of art that touch you in profound, formative ways is a beautiful part of growing up in a world that’s so thoroughly saturated with mass media. In their first film, <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>, writer / director Jane Schoenbrun turned that facet of childhood into an intimate coming-of-age horror about creating one’s identity on the internet. </p><p>But with their second feature, A24’s <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>, Schoenbrun cultivates that idea into an even more unsettling, moving narrative by framing obsessive fandom as both a blessing and a curse. Whereas <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair </em>was a snapshot of life in the age of modern social media, <em>I Saw the TV Glow </em>is an exploration of what it felt like to be an outcast teenager in the ’90s — a time when young fans of sci-fi and fantasy often had to find each other by chance.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-92f9809c-0bd9-40a4-a952-2d1b99dd0165"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135658/late-night-with-the-devil-horror-movie-shudder">The self-possessed horrors of Late Night with the Devil</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Courtesy of IFC Films and Shudder</cite></p></figure></div><p>Horror films live and die by their conceits.

David Dastmalchian, a character actor who you’ll recognize from the margins of half a dozen Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve movies, gets a rare star turn as Jack Delroy, the host of late-night talk show <em>Night Owls</em>. But in an era where Johnny Carson rules after-hours broadcast, Delroy’s second-place program is on the verge of getting canceled. The only way to save it, Delroy believes, is to air an extraordinary Halloween episode about the occult in the middle of sweeps season.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135658/late-night-with-the-devil-horror-movie-shudder">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

By the time I was old enough to appreciate “Back to the Future,” its cultural impact had dissipated. Had I been born 20 years earlier, I would have been 16 when it came out, and I’d probably understand the attachment people have to a prop made out of a shitty car, but whether it’s age or something else, I just don’t get it. </p><p>The thing is, though, I don’t think it’s specifically a “Back to the Future” thing. I just don’t see any point in owning something that’s so obviously a movie prop. Want to build a replica of the black Toyota SR5 from the same series? Go for it. In fact, I even understand paying a little extra for a truck with the right BTTF<em> </em>look. It’s a subtle nod to those who know, but to everyone else, you’re just driving around in a cool, old pickup truck. </p><p>A DMC-12 that’s been given the time machine treatment, on the other hand, is only cool to people who are big fans of a move that’s nearly 40 years old. If you took it to a convention or something, I could see the appeal there, but for use outside of that? You’re just driving around in an obvious movie prop, and it comes off like you desperately want people to talk to you about your car. For less than $10,000, I could maybe understand, but these things go for real money! There are five days left on the auction, and as previously mentioned, it’s already been bid up to $35,000. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this thing ends up going for more than I make in a year.</p><p>The real questions here are “To whom?” and “Why?” And while it probably sounds like I’m being snarky here, I promise I genuinely want to understand. What is the appeal of these cars? Are Gen X-ers realizing 65 is creeping up on them quickly and desperately trying to relive their youth? Please tell me what I’m missing because, clearly, I’m missing something here.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Friday, October 11.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m happy to report that it doesn’t, and actually goes out of its way to subvert the tropes its predecessors fed into. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-gay-trans-characters-story-1851666960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-gay-trans-characters-story-1851666960">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d833cb49eccbbe48194cb3de79db8bc2" data-recommend-id="image://d833cb49eccbbe48194cb3de79db8bc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist and Gallica look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist and Gallica look at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d833cb49eccbbe48194cb3de79db8bc2" data-recommend-id="image://d833cb49eccbbe48194cb3de79db8bc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist and Gallica look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Throughout <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s roughly 80 hours, the RPG’s protagonist carries a novel with him as he travels through the fantastical world of the United Kingdom of Euchronia.

I’m no stranger to throwing my heart and soul into the stories I devour in fiction, so <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>had me by the throat in mere minutes. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
