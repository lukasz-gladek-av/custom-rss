            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liam Hemsworth stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia some time ago, replacing Henry Cavill, who departed the show because of creative differences with the showrunners. While the masses have voiced their concerns about this switch, Hemsworth has proven willing to give the character all he has, which is the sentiment he professed in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Love or hate the casting, The Witcher returns this month with a penultimate series, and Liam Hemsworth is now the star of the show. In an interview with IGN, he explained how he’s handling all the doubt circulating online.</p>



<h2 id="h-liam-hemsworth-has-given-everything-he-has-to-geralt">Liam Hemsworth Has Given Everything He Has to Geralt</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-final-seasons-liam-hemsworth-and-showrunner-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-on-replacing-henry-cavill-and-crafting-a-really-good-payoff-to-the-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Liam Hemsworth and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (showrunner) sat down to talk about the upcoming series of The Witcher, which returns after a two-year hiatus between seasons.</p>



<p>For the last few months, fans of the show have been wrestling with the recasting of Geralt of Rivia, the instantly recognizable lead previously played by Henry Cavill. It was a sour move for many when Cavill departed the show, and plenty of viewers feel that Hemsworth doesn’t embody the character well enough.</p>



<p>Hemsworth disagrees:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a unique situation, to come into a show that someone else has been doing for a period of time. There was obviously a lot of talk from fans and opinions, and I think that’s great. This show has very passionate fans that care about these characters and care about this world. I appreciate that. I understand it.</p>



<p>I poured everything I had into this character. I wanted it to feel grounded. I wanted it to feel authentic. I really hope the audience enjoys the character and my interpretation of it… I got to work with so many great actors and play this wonderfully complex character that has a huge fan base. And I hope people come along for the ride. I feel very grateful to have had this experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hemworth referenced that he’d played The Witcher games ‘years ago’ and tried to get back into them when playing Geralt of Rivia for the live-action series. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had just started playing [Geralt] and I was like, ‘I don’t know how many minutes or hours I can spend walking around as this character right now whilst shooting the show at the same time.’ So I had a quick look at it and it reminded me of what I experienced years ago when I played it.</p>



<p>It didn’t feel like it was going to be hugely helpful to my experience at that time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that The Witcher show is based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-book-sapkowski/">on <strong>the books</strong></a><strong> </strong>and not <strong>the games</strong>.</p>



<p>Hissrich, the series’s showrunner, expressed how pleased she is with Hemsworth’s portrayal of Geralt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You need someone who you can imagine can excel at these action scenes, who has such a physical presence that they could be both intimidating in the story, but also, Geralt has a huge emotional side as well… What I really loved about Liam’s work that I had seen is that he was able to organically blend those two things. He didn’t have physical scenes and then emotional scenes. He was able to really carry this specific, I guess I call it soul. </p>



<p>He has a soul that he brings into the role… To have that present even through action scenes when he’s fighting monsters, and it’s the same thing that’s present when he’s having conversations with Ciri or with Yennefer, that was a really special thing that we were able to capture. And when I had watched some of his work, specifically going back to Hunger Games, that’s something that I felt from him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Witcher season four will be released exclusively on Netflix in its entirety on October 30. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest any time in the show.</p>

<p>Overall, the achievement and trophy list in <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> seems rather doable. While there are a lot of missions, a lot of these trophies have specific qualifications that revolve around cleaning a particular item first or last. We highly recommend taking a look at the trophy list before you start a job so you can square away the requirements as you move along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Making a surprise return from the original entry on the Nintendo GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is yet another mascot racing game set to release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With that said, what about the prospects of the new game coming to the Nintendo Switch 1? Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> have made their debut on both console generations. Is the same happening here?</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Kirby Air Riders will be on Nintendo Switch 1 or if it is a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Is Kirby Air Riders on Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dyna Blade is not ready to go back to the original Switch. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately for those who have not upgraded their console yet, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kirby Air Riders is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong></a><strong>, and it is not releasing on Nintendo Switch 1.</strong></p>



<p>With the Switch 2 releasing just earlier this year, why would Masahiro Sakurai’s latest game not be available on the original Switch? Most of it likely comes down to performance. On the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders may not be the most impressive graphically, but it runs at 60 fps, which might not be the same situation on the original console.</p>



<p>Of course, newer hardware is always more powerful than what came before, so we could definitely see a world where Sakurai and/or Nintendo wanted his first release since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to be as smooth-running as possible. The Switch 1 is a great console, but its history of poor performance is well-known, even in Nintendo games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-kirby-air-riders-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1">Will Kirby Air Riders Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>While it is certainly possible that Kirby Air Riders one day comes to Nintendo Switch 1, it’s not something we would bet on.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Switch 2 is, simply put, a more powerful console, and we’re not game developers ourselves, but we would wager a guess that the Switch 1 can’t handle <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoozuGVBxvh8fJftx43dJCineND4wXoWmBaXjdJiS58nTSdFgtbl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kirby Air Riders</a> quite as well.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not Sakurai and his team at Bandai Namco would want to put in the resources to port the game over to the original Switch post-release. You would imagine that the focus would be on supporting the game that is already available and then moving on to the next project.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you bummed out that Kirby Air Riders is a Switch 2 exclusive and likely won’t ever release on the original Nintendo Switch? Vent your frustrations in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now available on the Switch and Switch 2, and the first Mystery Gift distribution event has officially gone live.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial announcement, The Pokémon Company will be offering trainers across the globe an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. When trained, Ralts evolves into Kirlia and then Gardevoir. From there, it can be Mega Evolved into Mega Gardevoir.</p>
<p>Along with this, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes a "gift of 100 Poké Balls". Both of these gifts will be available to claim until <strong>28th February, 2026</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2ihksyl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the promotion above, it takes "approximately one hour of play time" before you can access the Mystery Gift feature. <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> adds to this with some additional information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mystery Gift is unlocked after you get the Pokédex in the game story. If you already have the Gardevoirite stone by the time you receive it, the Ralts will not have an item attached."</p>

<p>As with previous Pokémon games, we'll be sharing all future distribution events for Legends: Z-A here on Nintendo Life. We'll also have a guide up on the site soon.</p>

<p>This bumps the game up to Version 5.5.2, and according to the patch notes, it fixes an issue with League Battles tied to Switch 2 and Switch users. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Splatoon 2 - Ver. 5.5.2 (Released October 15, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Fixed an issue with League Battles where, when both Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch users were included in the eight players who battled, sometimes League Power did not change after the battle."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If there's anything else discovered about this latest software update, we'll let you know. The patch before this (Version 5.5.1) was released in November 2022.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released a bunch of other Switch patches recently, including updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and even the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> title.</p>

<p>No sensitive data appears to have been compromised</p>

<figure data-uuid="c11f95762e385"><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11f95762e385/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, the hacking group Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/notorious-group-crimson-collective-claims-to-have-hacked-nintendo">claimed it had breached Nintendo</a>. At the time, there was no official response from the video game giant.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, Nintendo has shared a statement with <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, and it appears to suggest there's been no personal, development, or business-related leaks.</p>
<p>Some external servers displaying Nintendo's website have reportedly been compromised, but there's apparently no evidence of this impacting customers or the company. Here's a rough translation including the statement shared on 15th October 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo responded to an interview with the Sankei Shimbun on the 15th, saying, "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information." Some external servers that display Nintendo's website were defaced, but the company said there was no evidence of damage to customers or intrusion into the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at this stage, there's been no personal data leaked, and it seems there seemingly won't be any secrets popping up about the company's games or business operations.</p>
<p>This update follows a story from earlier this week about the supposed hacker behind the Pokémon 'Teraleak' reportedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-z-as-source-code-and-beta-builds-have-now-supposedly-leaked">leaking the new game's source code</a> and beta builds.</p>

                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is well known as Sega's enduring mascot, especially during the publisher's nearly two-decade stint as a console manufacturer from 1983 to 2001. The company is also a pioneer in the arcade space, with many of its most important games starting out as groundbreaking arcade cabinets. However, despite that, the original Sonic the Hedgehog never got its own dedicated arcade version--until now. Sega is teaming up with My Arcade on a new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player</a> mini cabinet. The tiny device includes the first two Sonic the Hedgehog games with fully playable controls, but is small enough to fit on your shelf. The collectible launches on November 1, and preorders are available for $60 at Amazon.</p><div title="6534625 -- Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4318" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534625 -- Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCMZSLB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases November</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Sonic the Hedgehog mini-arcade includes both the first game and its sequel, all housed in a device that features a 3.5-inch full-color display, a joystick, three buttons, and artwork inspired by the original Sonic the Hedgehog arcade cabinet. In terms of dimensions, this is a snug little machine that measures 4 inches wide and 6.8 inches tall, so it can easily fit on your desk or your shelf. It can be powered by four AA batteries or a USB-C connection, and for audio it has a built-in speaker and a 3.5mm audio jack in case you want to connect a headset. </p>                      </div><p>My Arcade also has several other compact arcade cabinets to choose from right now, if you'd like to build a cute collection of gaming machines.

This is the third Evercade Alpha following the launch of Mega Man and Street Fighter editions, and if history repeats itself, we're expecting it to sell out shortly after it arrives.</p><p>Our other recommendation does cost a lot more, but comparatively speaking, there are still budget-friendly standing arcade cabinets for sale from Arcade1Up available.

			<p>What was once a slice of alternative history with a Irish prisoner escaping the Tower of London and becoming an influential samurai in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-review-a-samurai-epic-with-souls/">first Nioh title</a> has expanded now into a story of time travel and dual identity. Nioh 3 aims to reinvent the tale that Team Ninja has told over the past eight years with a new time period and setting.</p>



<p>As the grandson of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, players assume the role of a samurai whose unique set of skills allows them access to two completely different playstyles. With the Samurai playstyle, players engage in combat like William did in the first game, complete with multiple stances available for each weapon and a Ki Pulse maneuver to regain expended stamina. Playing as a Ninja, on the other hand, removes the stances completely and instead gives the player access to various ninjutsu and ninja tools to approach the combat with surprise attacks and less head-on assaults. Swapping between these two is a simple affair during combat, although I found myself sticking more to the tried-and-true Samurai style because of all of the muscle memory from the two previous Nioh titles. Unfortunately, weapon types are locked between the two combat styles for reasons that Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata mentioned in our interview below.</p>



<p>Much like earlier Nioh titles, enemies are literal fountains of loot with showers of weapons and gear of various rarities that pool forth and litter the screen. New loot filters allow players only to seek out higher rarity tiered items and automatically destroy/sell lower ranked gear that would otherwise clutter their inventory. While this doesn’t solve the issue of a lack of bespoke, unique items, it does at least push the player only to seek out stronger gear that would come with a potentially better roll of abilities.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 doesn’t pull any punches in terms of combat this time around either. Facing the bosses at the end of the Tokyo Game Show demo was an exercise in frustration and learning the intricacies of defensive abilities as Takeda Shingen wails on the player. Despite the challenges, this fight was a fantastic way to immerse players in the combat changes to Nioh 3 and allow them to use every ninja tool in their arsenal to best the boss. If other fights in Nioh 3 can match the intensity of this single fight, I’m looking at another 100-hour obsession when this finally launches on PlayStation 5 and PC next year <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on February 6, 2026</a>. We couldn’t get a good peek into the time travel this time around, but that’s something to keep our eyes open for in the months to come.</p>



<p>After getting thoroughly worked by Takeda Shingen's demonic form, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata for an intimate 1-on-1 interview, translated by one of Koei Tecmo's in-house interpreters.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why go with these time periods in Japanese history specifically for Nioh 3?</strong></p>



<p>With Nioh 3, we decided that we wanted to go with the idea of traveling through time. While in the past, we have focused on the Sengoku, or Warring States, Period and focused on major events in that period. Various major characters or historical figures have been included at key points within the story. This time, we wanted to use traversing through time as a key idea, but for the story, we would incorporate the Sengoku Period as well. For the start of the story, it might be better to start with something a little bit different than what people would expect. We decided to, rather than start from a period of war and battles, we wanted to start from a peaceful period, and from there, the protagonist ends up against the wall in terms of being targeted, and this leads to being able to travel through time, so then we can visit the various periods within Japanese history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>When you were creating the first Nioh title with William as the protagonist, did you already have plans for the story to evolve into time travel?</strong></p>



<p>No, it wasn’t something that we had in mind from the first game. We didn’t have this mapped out at all. One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</p>



<p>We’re using time travel to really showcase the open field element of Nioh 3, so we’ve incorporated that into the story. I guess I gotta say we got a little bit of a hit of this from the DLC for Nioh 2 because one of the DLCs does go through time.</p>



<p><strong>The Nioh series has predominantly been mission-focused, but in titles like Rise of the Ronin, it was largely open world with smaller discrete missions. When transitioning from a mission-based design to an open world, how do you keep that feeling structured and created in a specific way?</strong></p>



<p>One thing when creating this game that we really wanted to make sure that we kept to is that we wanted to make sure that there was freedom and exploration within the field. We wanted to make sure that we had that ability given to the player, but also at the same time, when they pick it up, they’ll instantly realize that Nioh 3 feels like a Nioh game. It’s this dark action RPG, but in terms of how we would portray it, we kept an eye on the density of the fields created and kept that feeling of tension throughout.</p>



<p>Not to say that it was easy, obviously. We went through a lot of trial and error. At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field. We found that just trying to defeat them gets a little bit tiring. You couldn’t really feel a difference, and it just felt like the same thing over and over again. We decided to formulate it in a way that you’ll encounter areas on the field that have a lot of enemies, but you might encounter a few enemies, but they’re very strong. On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through. We wanted to make sure that players know there are various ways to progress.</p>



<p>We incorporated a sort of mission, or various strategic ways that you can choose which path you want to go in order to clear the game. We want to make sure that we have that balance in the game as well. In the end, we have given players a lot of different options in how they can explore and get through the various missions, but in the end, when they play it, they’ll definitely feel that this is a Nioh game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field.

On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Masocore (Masochism Hardcore) has been an identity of the Nioh series. You’ll have veterans who are very comfortable with this type of difficult action, but there will also be new players who are playing Nioh 3 for the first time in the series. How do you balance where you want to challenge veteran players while also making the game accessible for new players?</strong></p>



<p>The first thing I want to say is that the enemies themselves have not become weaker and they’re still very strong. I think that in terms of Nioh 3, in order to defeat those enemies, players will have to reach a level where they can defeat them.</p>



<p>We’ve incorporated elements such as player growth, skill growth, as well as being able to learn the game systems. As players learn the system mechanics, they’ll catch on to how to defeat the enemies. We’ve made sure that it’s easier to learn as you play, so we do have tutorials in Nioh 3. We have onboarding elements as well incorporated into the main structure of the game. Even though the enemies themselves remain powerful, those who are new to the game won’t be able to instantly defeat them but as they play through Nioh 3, they’ll understand the mechanics and ways to defeat them so that it isn’t a frustrating experience.&nbsp; For those who are used to the series, they can get right into Nioh 3.</p>



<p>One of the changes that we’ve done is with the Samurai Style. In previous games, you were instantly given the different stances of High, Mid, and Low. This time, when you start the game off as a Samurai, you’ll start with just the Mid stance so that you can learn the mechanics and get used to it and then learn the other stances so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. For players who haven’t played in a while, maybe they just need a reminder on how to get into the game. We’ve retained the difficulty level of the Nioh series, but we’ve given players the opportunity to be able to overcome the game and skill up in a fair way.</p>



<p><strong>With Nioh 3 having two different combat styles, I did see that weapon types were segregated between the two styles. Does that mean that the Samurai style will not be able to use the Tonfa or Kusarigama?</strong></p>



<p>Essentially, no, you cannot switch between the two. When we came up with the Ninja and Samurai styles, we also decided on the weapons that would match that image of a Ninja. Up until now, Nioh has only had Samurai in it. This might be more because I’m Japanese and it’s our intrinsic feeling, but it’s about what kind of weapons we would see. The Tonfa and Kusarigama were very common for Ninjas, but we don’t have that image for Samurai or didn’t think that it would be fitting for a Samurai to be able to use those weapons. Even for things like Spears, you know that Samurai would use them, but not a Ninja. But for weapons like the Katana, that’s something that both Samurai and Ninja have used and wield a single, or even double blade. That is one common weapon between the two, but even with the same weapon, the way they use it is quite different. A Samurai might hold the weapon up above their head, whereas Ninjas would hold it behind them in a different style. Even though it’s the same weapon, how they use it is quite distinct but also fitting for that style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a veteran Nioh player, I typically play with a Kusarigama in High stance, so with that weapon being limited to the Ninja style, I have to relearn that weapon with a new moveset. I understand, and it was the dev team’s decision to do things like that. We apologize for that, but if you could use a weapon in either style, the distinct elements between the two Styles would be a little bit muddled. We wanted to make sure to keep the two Styles distinct and one of the ways was in the weapon selection.</p>

<p><strong>Onmyo Talismans have been very powerful in previous Nioh titles, and I was wondering if they will still be as powerful in Nioh 3. Will you be rebalancing those, or have players play with less of a focus on that playstyle?</strong></p>



<p>The Talismans are still in and we have made some adjustments. They are overall powerful and we have made some adjustments, but it’s not to the extent that they seem a lot weaker or stronger than in pervious games. One thing that has changed is how you obtain Talismans. In Nioh 3, you obtain them by defeating Yokai.</p>



<p><strong>Nioh games have a lot of equipment you can gather; some say the loot is quantity over quality. When you’re going through a level and you have 20 different Katanas dropping, how do you make it feel like players want to upgrade and look for new equipment?</strong></p>



<p>One thing that we’ve done is make it easier to handle or look at your stock of weapons. One of the new features you can set is that the most powerful weapon in your possession is automatically equipped. We’ve also added a setting so that if something drops and it’s below a certain rarity, you can automatically sell it off or get rid of it. You can immediately tell what is of the most value and what isn’t. It should be easier to get through the quantity.</p>



<p>Another thing that we’ve done with Nioh 3 is because of the two Styles. For example, with the Ninja style and Ninpo, you can find equipment with stronger effects. We’ve given players an incentive to look for these things and equip them to become stronger.</p>



<p><strong>Once you finish Nioh 3, will you unlock a higher difficulty level?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we have incorporated that into a second playthrough where you can increase the difficulty level and I think that has become a staple for the Nioh series.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages just got a new patch, Update 2.2, and the notes bring up some bug fixes and Steam Deck verification.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, Doom: The Dark Ages brought the rip and tear of past titles to Medieval times. Reviews called the game a bloody good time, besting the previous Doom Eternal. While it wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-player-count-is-the-lowest-of-the-reboot-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as others</a>, it remains one of 2025’s best shooters. Luckily, there’s more to enjoy thanks to Update 2.2, which releases today.</p>



<p>The patch, releasing on all platforms, aims to fix many bugs and Quality of Life (QoL) issues. Furthermore, Doom: The Dark Ages is now Steam Deck Verified, so the game can be played successfully on the portable console. More additions include adjustments to The Ripatorium and tuning of the Brink of Death system.</p>

Drivers can “race to stop at designated platforms,” and are “scored on their ability to handle their train with precision and control under pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York’s first trailer was revealed as part of IGN Fan Fest and, as you can see in the player at the top of the page, gives a brief glimpse into train racing mechanics. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metro Rivals: New York Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dovetail, the game’s narrative sees “players begin their journey with nothing but a hand-me-down train and a determination to rise. To succeed, they must take on a variety of missions, earn cash fares, upgrade their train’s performance, build a loyal following, and earn respect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be in-game purchases, Dovetail says those are “entirely cosmetic” and that the game is not “pay-to-win.” Instead, players “can express themselves with extensive options to upgrade their train’s performance, apply unique skins and liveries in signature colours, and personalise their character’s appearance to stand out on the tracks.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if neither the single player campaign nor the PvP mode is your cup of tea, you also have the option to partake in a “more relaxed experience” where “players can set their own paths, hop into their train, and enjoy the sights of the city.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/11/screenshot-2025-10-11-at-4-46-46-pm-1760216249699.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metro Rivals: New York will be available on Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in early 2026. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York marks Dovetail’s first use of Unreal Engine 5 in the development process. They also collaborated with the team at Reactional Music to utilize a procedural music engine, meaning that “music is fully native and cinematically integrated in the game, even when swapping tracks.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York is being developed for Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S and is available for wishlisting now.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-rivals-new-york-dovetails-new-train-simcade-game-announced-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

The video’s tone rides a line between Borderlands and Fallout, as the player’s chosen Earth Directorate agent can be seen wielding everything from explosive rocket launchers and melee tools to Spacer’s Choice-branded rifles featuring their lunar mascot, Moon Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of The Outer Worlds 2’s colorful guns has unique properties that will no doubt aid players on their journey through the space colony of Arcadia. We probably don’t need to explain why a buzzsaw mounted on the end of a staff or wrist-mounted gun might come in handy, but the trailer does a good job of showing off how different weapons can be used. Other highlights from the footage include a lime-green acid gun that melts bodies, alien pistols, and even environmental hazards like a ceiling-mounted turret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another star of the new The Outer Worlds 2 trailer is the different factions, which can be found across a variety of locations that look like they were ripped straight out of the all-time great sci-fi stories. It’s a jam-packed teaser ahead of launch, and it’s undeniably Obsidian.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 has a release date of October 29, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dan Trachtenberg’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-badlands">Predator: Badlands</a> was inspired by a number of video games. The director has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-death-planet-name-the-new-predators-name-and-reveals-inspiration-from-shadow-of-the-colossus">2005 PlayStation masterpiece Shadow of the Colossus inspired the relationship between the film’s young Predator, called Dek, and Elle Fanning’s character, a Weyland-Yutani synth he must carry around</a>. Now, add World of Warcraft to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You wouldn’t think Blizzard’s massively multiplayer fantasy online role-playing game would have much in common with a new Predator movie. But Trachtenberg, who already has Predator films Prey and Killer of Killers under his belt, told IGN at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition</a> that he took inspiration from one class in particular when it came to Dek’s arsenal of weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">How to Watch the Predator Movies in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets,” Trachtenberg said of Dek’s weaponry. “I’ve always felt like there’s a link between the Predator franchise and James Bond. Part of what we enjoy about going to see it is like, what kind of gizmos does he have? And I’ve been stuck in the past with my entries into the franchise, with Prey set in the 1700s and Killer of Killers set in multiple different decades. But all in the past, so I’ve always had to think, what would his weaponry be if it was a little bit more pre what we’re used to seeing? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now I’m well into the future. So he’s got laser bows, has an awesome laser sword that has multiple modes. His sword that he uses, he holds like a classic knight or samurai would, but then it switches it into a different mode and he can use it almost like a glaive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s the glaive mode of Dek’s new laser sword that was inspired by a weapon in World of Warcraft, which Trachtenberg told us he plays a lot. If you’re familiar with WoW, you’ll know the Demon Hunter class well, and you’ll no doubt have seen its iconic warglaive, perhaps wielded by fan-favorite Demon Hunter Illidan Stormrage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In fact the inspiration initially for that was… I play a lot of WoW, and the Demon Hunters glaive weapon was what sparked that,” Trachtenberg confirmed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most recent Predator: Badlands trailer, we see Dek use his laser sword in fights against a number of monsters, the ‘Death Planet’ itself, and other Yautja. But it’s interesting to note Trachtenberg’s words in his interview with IGN: “He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets.” Could Dek end up losing his powerful weaponry, Metroid style, over the course of the movie?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-is-confirmed-pg-13-rather-than-r-rated-and-fans-of-the-famously-violent-franchise-certainly-have-opinions-about-that">Predator: Badlands won’t be R-rated</a>. But, its creators hope, it will feel like an R regardless. And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-theres-no-xenomorph-in-this-movie-so-the-aliens-vs-predator-rematch-is-going-to-have-to-wait"><u>Trachtenberg said fans shouldn’t expect to see a Xenomorph from the Alien franchise in Predator: Badlands</u></a>, despite evil megacorp Weyland-Yutani featuring prominently in the movie’s trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predator: Badlands hits theaters November 7, 2025.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital video game storefront Good Old Games</a>, aka GOG, is hosting a massive sales event dedicated to open-world games. Or, well, <em>mostly</em> open-world games. It really depends on how you define what is and isn’t an open-world game.</p> <p>This week, GOG launched a big ol’ sales event featuring some remarkably steep discounts on a variety of games that it classifies as open world. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20251015_open_world_promo?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true#Catalog">The sales event runs until October 25 and features nearly 400 PC games</a>, including some big hits lik<em>e <a href="https://kotaku.com/saint-s-row-the-third-remastered-looks-nice-but-feels-1843608576">The Outer Worlds, Saints Row: The Third,</a> Shadow of Mordor, Sleeping Dogs, </em>and <em>Far Cry 2.&nbsp;</em>All of these games are only available on PC and, like all other games on GOG, don’t feature any DRM. Which is great! This is a good sale. And if all you care about is seeing a list of some of the best and biggest deals I spotted from the sale, scroll past the next paragraph and check that list out. Enjoy it! Happy shopping.</p> <p>Okay, the real sickos are still here. Good. Scrolling through GOG’s list of open-world games made me ponder what is an open-world game. How do you define it? Is <em>Slime Rancher</em> an open-world game, or just a game that features a large map you can freely explore? Do open-world games need side quests? Activities to complete? I think so, but perhaps my definition is too strict? Or maybe trying to categorize every piece of media into various genres and subgenres is silly, and I should stop thinking about this so much? Probably that one.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><strong><em>Deadly Premontion: Director’s Cut</em> </strong>– $1.25 ($25)</li> <li><strong><em>Dropsy</em> </strong>– $1 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds</em> </strong>– $8 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Greedfall</em> </strong>– $3 ($35)</li> <li><strong><em>Slime Rancher</em></strong> – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Hard West</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of War Definitive Edition</em> </strong>– $6 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row 2</em> </strong>– $1.5 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: The Third Remastered</em> </strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em></strong> – 3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: Gat out of Hell</em> </strong>– $4 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Dungeon Siege Collection </em></strong>(1,2,3) – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>LEGO DC Super-Villains Deluxe Edition</em></strong> – $9 ($55)</li> <li><strong><em>Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</em></strong> – $3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>American Fugitive</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rustler (Grand Theft Horse)</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Brutal Legend</em></strong> – $3 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>No Man’s Sky</em> </strong>– $24 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry</em></strong> – $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry 2</em> </strong>– $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Two Worlds Epic Edition</em></strong> – $5 ($15)</li> </ul>

<p>Could Sony’s MLB The Show franchise be making its way to PC? Rumors are circulating that the nearly 20-year-old series is set to release on the platform, thanks to a recently discovered job posting.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego Studios is looking for a Senior Graphics PC Programmer to work on a “AAA PC Title”. There are no other details about what this game could be, as the rest of the posting goes into what the role will involve, such as optimizing the game for real-time graphics on the system, as well as optimizing their PC engine. </p>



<p>While the job may be for a different IP, the fact that Sony San Diego hasn’t released a non-MLB title since 2017 has led to many speculating about the future of the series. The last game releases from the studio that wasn’t baseball came in 2017 when both StarBlood Arena and Drawn to Death were launched.</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve primarily been an MLB The Show studio, including releasing the series on Xbox platforms starting in 2021. The game even made its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2022. The latest installment, MLB The Show 25, was released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As far as MLB games available for PC, the last AAA baseball game released for the platform was MLB 2K12 in 2012.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony San Diego for comment on the job posting and whether it was for MLB The Show or a new IP coming to PC. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article and shared on social media.</p>
