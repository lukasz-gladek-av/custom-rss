            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series publisher Bandai Namco has revealed that it plans to release remastered versions of games in the series on a regular basis, and that a special development initiative has been set up to this end.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of a new 30th-anniversary broadcast (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/bandai-namco-to-release-remastered-tales-of-titles-fairly-consistently" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>),&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>titles will be released "fairly consistently", and that the studio "intends to continue" remastering&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games "as much as possible".</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that what he calls the "Remastered Project" now has a dedicated development initiative devoted to it, and that the team is hard at work on that project, although he didn't say which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is up for a remaster next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=uhSZKwAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=qITewjIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games are on the way, Bandai Namco says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomizawa's words come around a month before the newest&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, is set to launch. It's a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f</em>, which is itself a port of the 2009 Wii game&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces</em>, with the Wii version only ever being released in Japan.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series does not include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a>. It's confusing, I know, but Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games carry a specific action RPG formula that marries real-time combat with fairly typical JRPG dungeon and overworld exploration.</p>

<p>The most recent mainline&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game, and the series' 17th main entry overall, is 2021's&nbsp;<em>Tales of Arise</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-arise-has-sold-3-million-copies-before-releasing-on-game-pass-and-playstation" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up three million sales for itself</a> before being added to Microsoft and Sony's subscription services earlier this year.</p>

<p>Tomizawa has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tales-of-arise-interview-yusuke-tomizawa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Arise&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game for first-timers, but he has also acknowledged the importance of making the RPG, which has a slightly more realistic visual sensibility than many of its predecessors, appeal to "everyone".</p>




<p>As for which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is next to get the remastering treatment, it's far too early to say.</p>

<p>Tomizawa and Bandai Namco are staying tight-lipped, and since&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered&nbsp;</em>still hasn't come out yet, it's likely that launch will take up a lot of the publisher's attention for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

On average, it will take players anywhere between 50-100 hours to max out a class through various end-game activities, depending on your playstyle and any assistance you receive. That’s a lot of playtime if you’re intent on trying out everything on offer. Let’s go over which classes are the best options for new <em>Path of Exile 2</em> players. </p><figure id="" data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you should always play whatever class speaks to you the most, from a playstyle and preferences perspective, <strong>choose the Mercenary as your first class if you want to see everything <em>Path of Exile 2</em> offers</strong>. It’s one of the all-new classes designed for the ARPG sequel, and as such, developer Grinding Gear Games spent a lot of time refining its abilities, gems, and passive skills, making for an exceptionally strong playstyle.</p><p>The Mercenary primarily utilizes crossbows with various round-based attachments and unique grenades to deal damage. One of the first skills you’ll unlock as part of the game’s prologue is Fragmentation Rounds, which essentially turns your crossbow into a close-range shotgun loaded with Dragon’s Breath rounds. Every shot, while slow to fire and reload, unleashes a burst of fire that deals significant up-close damage to enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From there, you’ll gain access to the game’s skill panel to unlock additional abilities once you receive an Uncut Gem. There are a few choices for the Mercenary’s best starting skills, but there’s nothing wrong with experimenting. You’ll receive countless gems throughout your playthrough, allowing you to mix and match or outright remove and replace abilities depending on the zone or your preferences. You’re not locked into a single build!</p><p>One crucial aspect to consider when selecting a class in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is how it plays solo. Many people play the game alone, though the sequel allows up to six players to cooperate while clearing bosses and zones. After spending approximately 30 hours playing through the main storyline as a Mercenary, I can attest that, while weak against certain bosses, the class does exceptionally well for the most part. It keeps enemies at range with diverse abilities designed to reduce movement capabilities, AoE (area-of-effect) attacks that make clearing small mobs of standard enemies a breeze, and single-shot damage attacks designed for elite enemies, like bosses and named mobs.</p><figure id="" data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Furthermore, the ability to wear various armor types, from leather to plate, makes the Mercenary a stalwart choice. If you don’t mind moving slowly, becoming a mobile tank, then heavy armor locks down your defense. But if you want to keep moving, use run-and-gun tactics with the crossbow, wear light armor, and dodge-roll away from danger with relative ease.</p><p>There’s a lot to love about Path of Exile 2, from its classes to the many tough-as-nails boss fights you’ll encounter, but it appears there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522">loot problem the devs intend to solve</a></span>.

As a lifelong Shadow the Hedgehog stan, I’m glad to hear that. I rewatched the first two movies last week as a refresher, and that first one is actually a lot better than I remembered. These movies still have their problems, like an overreliance on pop culture references and too much of the human characters for my liking, but it sounds like the third movie is addressing some of those issues. We’ll have our full review on <em>Kotaku</em> when the film launches later this week.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies, reaching a significant milestone for the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-sells-over-28-6-million-copies">Elden Ring Sells Over 28.6 Million Copies</h2>



<p>Announced <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241213_eldenring_nightreign_debut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently</a> by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies globally. Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a> from Niko Partners, the Dark Souls series sold only 27 million units before Elden Ring was released in February 2022. Since then, however, the franchise has sold over <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/integrated/pdf/2023EN_fact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">35 million units</a>, and Elden Ring was one of the factors that helped amplify the sales of this series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One factor that helped Elden Ring hit this number was the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which was released in June 2024. Before its release, Elden Ring’s sales were at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-breaks-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 million</a>; an additional 3.6 million units were sold in the last six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elden Ring franchise already has plans to keep the sales going in 2025. Announced during the latest iteration of The Game Awards, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new co-op action-adventure game</a> called Elden Ring Nightreign. This co-op title will act as a spin-off rather than a sequel and will be released for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign will <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank">host</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a network test in February</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was rated 18+ by PEGI, the classification board in charge of game ratings across Europe. Developer LocalThunk has resurfaced frustration over the rating, joking in a series of tweets that it should add "real gambling" to lower its rating down to 3+, like the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111242" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI's reasoning for the rating</a>, the board singles out the use of real-life poker hands in Balatro, stating that its inclusion could teach players its mechanics for use in real gambling. Despite poker just being the basis for Balatro's roguelite gameplay, PEGI says its prominent gambling imagery is deserving of its highest Adults Only rating. This rating isn't new either--earlier this year, it was the reason Balatro was suddenly pulled from several console storefronts, as its previous 3+ rating was changed overnight without prior notice.</p><p>LocalThunk hasn't let it go, citing a game that several European countries have previously deemed to have gambling elements. EA Sport FC 25 contains the same microtransactions and loot-box mechanics that have been in the series ever since Ultimate Team was first announced, but has maintained its 3+ "suitable for all ages" rating. LocalThunk points to this specifically as a double standard, even joking that Balatro should incorporate the same mechanics in order to get its rating lowered.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</p>  — localthunk (@LocalThunk) <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>LocalThunk continued to say that the issue wasn't necessarily with Balatro's own rating, but that other more blatant examples of "gambling mechanics for children" should be similarly clamped down on. "The red logo looks kinda dope," concluded the developer.</p><p>Balatro's rating hasn't stopped its meteoric success since launch. The game has sold over 3.5 million copies, and won several awards at last week's The Game Awards show. The captivating roguelite is also one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's top 10 games of 2024</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the previous film featured Shadow in a scene after the credits, setting up the story for this third film.</p>
<p>Many fans are therefore eagerly awaiting this film's equivalent scene to see who might be coming next. This is your warning, then, to mute any necessary keywords and watch out on social media.</p>

<p>The UK premiere for the film took place last week, alongside various early viewing screenings. As such, recorded footage has now found its way online - we won't link to it here.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will release worldwide on 20th December, so it's not long until the post credits scene has been widely viewed.</p> <div>

More than anything, though, there’s a letting go of illusions. The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can’t figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!”</p><p><em>Wukong</em>, which won both the Players’ Voice award and Best Action Game, might be considered rather successful at the awards. It was beaten to GOTY, however, by <em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony’s self-congratulatory and adorable third-person platform game, and faced some serious competition with the likes of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> also nominated. And while Ji recognized that all these games are “exceptional,” this apparently did not stop reactions at the ceremony from being so strong that some sitting nearby say they saw Game Science developers crying when the game failed to win.</p><p>Ji’s Weibo post goes on to say that he was so confident of winning this trophy that he wrote his acceptance speech <em>two years ago</em>. He explains that he was more optimistic than some of his colleagues, and states that the game’s success commercially and with players was not a fluke, but rather “an inevitable outcome of Chinese culture.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/chinese-players-review-bomb-baldurs-gate-3-steam-black-myth-wukong-loses-goty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MP1st</em> reports</a></span> that some Chinese fans took the loss no better. In a grim turn of events, furious <em>Wukong</em> stans decided to review-bomb <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, of all games, after Larian boss Swen Vincke’s wonderful three-minute introduction to the GOTY award. During this speech, Vincke took the opportunity to argue for an industry that looks after its developers rather than exploits them, and that makes games for art as well as profit, but this may have been misunderstood by a contingent of <em>Wukong</em>’s Chinese fans. <em>MP1st</em> claims it’s a result of a poor translation read by Chinese players, but doesn’t point to where this may have happened.</p><p>When someone has poured their life and soul into a project, it’s extremely understandable for them to become emotionally involved in the rewards and awards that follow. It’s also the case that award ceremonies are subjective popularity contests, in which wholly dissimilar things (like a 3D cartoon platform game about a robot and a tough-as-nails action game based on Chinese mythology) are artificially pitted against one another, with results based on the voting whims of a small group of individually partisan industry representatives. It must feel lovely to win, but it’s also entirely daft.</p><p>If your favorite game of 2024 was <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, then you need not craft a trophy out of tin foil, but instead just recognize that that’s enough entirely on its own, and doesn’t require the validation of a few strangers who got to vote in the Dorito man’s yearly shindig.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, a developer at Unpacking studio Witch Beam is calling out the latter title as one of many "egregious scams" on the Switch's online storefront.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Unpacking creative director Wren Brier took <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3ldfndqrhzk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to BlueSky</a> to challenge Nintendo to remove "cheap fakes" from the Switch's eShop. "It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop," Brier wrote. "Nintendo hasn't responded to any of our reports of these egregious scams which are using our trademarked game name and purposely tricking Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes."</p><p dir="ltr">Brier originally posted about the Unpacking clones on November 28 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3lbzzabxois2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on BlueSky</a>.

The game results did pull up the original Unpacking first, but right next to it is Unpacking: Deluxe Edition.

Other games available on the Switch eShop from the company include Cowboys vs Zombies: Deluxe Edition, Anime Puzzle Quest: Deluxe Edition, and Car Parking: Premium Edition.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Witch Beam has dealt with Unpacking clones, either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unpacking-creator-nintendo-eshop-copies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p><em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>developer Wren Brier has claimed that Nintendo isn't responding to her requests to take down blatant copies of the game that are still squatting on the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:en7lk6dayjekqei65vpfornn/post/3ldfndqrhzk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Brier points out that this issue was first raised <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3lbzzabxois2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around two weeks ago</a>, when a user by the name of Daniel Vuckovic described eShop listings like&nbsp;"<em>Unpacking: Deluxe Edition</em>" as "straight up copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Earlier today, though, in the new thread, Brier says that "it's been over two weeks" and that the listings, which also include the likes of "<em>Unpacking: Chill Music Pack</em>" and "<em>Unpacking: Haunting Locations</em>", still haven't been removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unpacking-eshop-copies-bluesky-wren-brier.jpg?itok=AE_qLbMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unpacking-eshop-copies-bluesky-wren-brier.jpg?itok=WHs-odEr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Things are pretty bad when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>knockoffs on the Switch. Screenshot courtesy of Wren Brier.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but Nintendo hasn't responded to any of Brier's reports of what she calls "these egregious scams", which she accuses of using&nbsp;<em>Unpacking</em>'s "trademarked game name" in order to "purposely [trick] Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes".</p>

<p>Disappointingly, this isn't the first time Brier and her team have run into spurious grifters trying to profit off their work. Back in 2022, a <a href="https://x.com/UnpackingALife/status/1485791817757245441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similar issue arose</a> when a mobile&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>ripoff topped the charts on the iOS App Store (shortly before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">being removed</a>, that is).</p>

<p>It's especially disheartening when considering that Nintendo is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hdh1jb/comment/m1weaho/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently more than happy</a> to enforce the kind of strict content regulations that lead to the&nbsp;<em>Neptunia&nbsp;</em>games' Western release being canceled on Switch, but not to deal with seemingly obvious cases of infringement like this.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>itself, if you haven't played it, it's a puzzle game that revolves around putting objects in their proper place across a series of rooms. As you play, you'll also uncover a narrative told through the kinds of objects you're, well, unpacking.</p>

<p>The game proved popular with players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unpacking-sales-move-across-million-mark" rel="nofollow">crossing the million-sale mark</a>&nbsp;in November 2022 and bagging itself a mobile release the following year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-pushed-china%E2%80%99s-gaming-industry-to-new-heights-in-2024.1062405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently reported that China has enjoyed a record-high year for revenue in the games industry. In new data, it was highlighted that numbers swelled by more than 7.5% in 2024, hitting highs of $44.8 <strong>billion</strong>. This makes the Chinese video games market the second-largest domestic market on the planet.</p>



<p>Most of the growth is being attributed to Black Myth: Wukong, which set staggering sales records this year and was regarded as China’s first AAA game. The mythical title was released in August 2024 and remains popular today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-boosted-figures">Boosted Figures</h2>



<p>While it’s not the largest year-on-year increase China has seen of late, the figures speak for themselves – China’s video games industry is <strong>soaring</strong>. In 2023, a post-COVID boom introduced 14% growth in revenue, and while this year’s increase rate has been slashed in half, the total value is much higher overall.</p>



<p>This news was reported by the ‘China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association’ in Beijing and was circulated <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3290626/chinas-video-gaming-revenue-hits-new-high-2024-back-blockbuster-releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SCMP.com</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chinese organisation said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The scale of the domestic market has been steadily increasing, with new mobile titles and single-player titles making outstanding contributions. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>China is also enjoying a boom in mobile gaming, with the data showing that up to three-quarters of the overall revenue accrued through 2024 is attributed to mobile games. Black Myth: Wukong may have turned millions of heads both in China and overseas, but mobile games are still king in the country.</p>



<p>It was further reported that the number of active gamers in China also grew this year, and now more than 670 million individuals across the country are engaging in video games in some way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of a new patch for Alan Wake 2. Version 1.27 is mainly aimed at improving the PlayStation 5 Pro support for the survival horror game.</p>
<p>When the new console launched in November, Digital Foundry <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, which performs admirably in most games, wasn't a great fit for this one due to the low internal rendering resolution. A few days later, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would take a few weeks to improve the quality of the PS5 Pro version.</p>
<p>About a month later, this new patch adds several options and improvements to Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<ul>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li>
<li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch is also available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, which are getting the following minor fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li>
<li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched on October 27, 2023 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a> and overall reception from fans. However, sales weren't equally amazing. To this day, after the release of the two planned story DLCs (Night Springs and The Lake House), the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> only 1.8 million units and still <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn't managed</a> to recoup all of the development and marketing costs.</p>

			<p>Have you ever played a video game, where you are convinced there’s a good game in there somewhere – maybe even a great game – it’s just that you can’t quite reach it? That you can’t connect with it, despite your best efforts. The game in question does enough to convince you something brilliant is coming and it’s right around the corner, but you never actually reach it. It’s like the developers have constructed a veritable wall of nonsensical game mechanics, a moat of lacklustre tutorials, and a maze of unappealing level design, to stop you from finding the good game hidden within. Well, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is that game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flint: Treasure of Oblivion - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTfxCsPb32k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set before the events of Robert Louis Stevenson’s iconic adventure story Treasure Island, Flint: Treasures of Oblivion follows the escapades of the eponymous Captain Flint. Taking place in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, during the so-called ‘Golden Age of Piracy’, Treasure of Oblivion really does deliver on all of the Piratey shenanigans that anyone could ask for. Double crosses, betrayals, parrots and peg legs, this certainly ticks all the boxes that a fandom brought up on Pirates of the Caribbean movies could ask for. Storyline-wise, this is a fairly standard tale interestingly told.</p>


<p>Thanks to the expertly drawn comic book panels and speech bubbles that crop up during gameplay, Treasure of Oblivion rather nostalgically brings to mind the much-underrated Sega comic-inspired beat ‘em up Comix Zone; though without the fourth wall-breaking which defined that 1995 classic. As a big fan of comic books, I found this stylish method of storytelling immensely engaging, even if the narrative itself was a tired amalgam of a stereotypical pirate yarn.</p>


<p>Played from an isometric viewpoint, Treasure of Oblivion is ostensibly a strategy RPG, though, unfortunately, Savage Level have rather over-sugared the rum. Shoved into your standard TBS mechanics are card collection – to power your crews’ abilities – and dice rolling – to decide who hits who. Sure, many strategy games involve secret dice rolling, influenced by various factors, to determine if your soldier hits an enemy with their sword, say, but in Treasure of Oblivion that roll is blatant, even going so far as to animate the dice for your benefit.</p>
<p>The effect is that everything feels completely random, with too few opportunities for players to impact the outcome in any meaningful way. The combination of cards, dice, and turn based combat, makes the gameplay cluttered and confusing, which is further hindered by terrible tutorials that fail to sufficiently explain how all these mechanics work individually and collectively. Worse, the terrible fiddly controls, on console at least, add to the frustration. In short, I won combat encounters, but I was never really sure how or why.</p>

<p>Visually Treasure of Oblivion is nice enough to look at but does a poor job of signposting where you should be going, leading to wandering around the mostly linear levels clicking on the environment until you find something to interact with. Frame rate drops and minor bugs abound, leading to the sense that this pirate game needed a little more time before it emerged from the depths of development.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		With more development time, copious patches, and some decent tutorials, the good game hidden deep inside Flint: Treasure of Oblivion could be dug up and unearthed. But for now, that treasure remains hidden, with only a map inscribed on the back of a wooden peg leg to try and find it.	</p></div>

            <p>The creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, has called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop.</p>
<p>Seventeen days ago, Brier shared a Bluesky post with a series of games titled Unpacking on the eShop, clearly inspired by Witch Beam's award-winning game and sharing the same trademarked name.</p>
<p>Specifically, Unpacking Universe Dreams from CGI Lab (and its DLC packs) was added to the store on 26th October, which invites players to "explore a whimsical world where each box holds new adventures" as they "unpack and arrange items in vibrant locations, each with its own unique atmosphere".</p>

<p>Earlier today, Brier posted on Bluesky once more, stating Nintendo has not responded to reports of these "egregious scams".</p>
<p>"It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop," wrote Brier. "Nintendo hasn't responded to any of our reports of these egregious scams which are using our trademarked game name and purposely tricking Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes."</p>

</span></p><p>This isn't the first time the Unpacking developers have faced this type of scam. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts">another Unpacking imitator was removed</a> from the iOS and Google Play store after topping their most-downloaded charts.</p>
<p>"If you've happened to catch an ad for a suspiciously similar-looking game to Unpacking on mobile recently, please know that this is not our game," the official Unpacking account explained at the time. "They sure seem to want to give the impression that it is, though!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for further comment.</p>
<p>This also isn't the only game on the store from Moldovan studio CGI Lab. Two other games from the developer are currently listed: SCP-087 The Stairwell Horror and Abyss: Backrooms Pools Horror. However, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/no-indie-hit-unpacking-hasnt-unboxed-new-dlc-its-just-another-naff-eshop-clone">Nintendo Life</a> previously reported, the developer has released games such as Video Game Store: Supermarket Simulator, Car Parking Legends: Drive &amp; Park Adventure and Anime Puzzle Quest: The Magical Girls Adventure. These are all no longer on the store and the <a href="https://cgilabgames.com/">CGI Lab website</a> does not list its games.</p>
<p>The Switch eShop has long been scrutinised, in particular for a prevalence in hentai games. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-updated-eshop-rules-on-adult-content-publisher-says">Nintendo revised its eShop rules on adult content</a> as a result.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent came under fire for its Light of Motiram game</a> that's heavily inspired by Sony's Horizon games - or Horizon Zero Originality as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s game has been jokingly dubbed.</p>

			<p>New leaks that emerged online over the weekend have provided another look at the Nintendo Switch 2 supposed design, the system's ports, and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1heyizw/more_photos_of_the_switch_2/?share_id=9la12PrZ5fFQxo6Zaow3S&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, another Chinese manufacturer shared images of their upcoming accessories, providing a look not only at the supposed design of the system but also at details like the back stand, Joy-Con controller buttons, the top of the system, and more. While we have seen the system's design multiple times already, these images help us get a better idea of how the Nintendo Switch 2 will look, although we still do not know if this will indeed be the console's final design.</p>
<p>Another detailed look at the Nintendo Switch 2 ports also arrived during the weekend, thanks to the Chinese leaker who previously created <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">CAD models</a> of the system based on a prototype used by an accessories manufacturer, providing the first supposed look at the console. Reddit user Fidler_2k also shared the images again with details on what each port showed on the system's top and bottom could be for, and you can find them on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1heg76q/xiaohongshu_the_one_who_originally_leaked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">The number of leaks</a> that have been circulating online in the past few days is a very good indication of how players are excited about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like they aren't the only ones. According to Paul Gate, many of those who attended this year's The Game Awards after-party were very positive about the system, and some instances of confirmed dedicated support were also promising to hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My take away from The Game Awards after party regarding the successor to Nintendo Switch was VERY positive.</p>
<p>Many people that I spoke to were excited to see the system, hyped over what Nintendo’s games were going to look like next generation, or ready to play more modern…</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-bandai-namco-best-selling/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is doing quite well on the market, so much so that it is reportedly one of Bandai Namco's best-selling games ever.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-games-in-bandai-namco-history-a-nice-surprise-in-a-year-thats-been-kind-of-rough-overall-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Circana's executive director and games analyst Matt Piscatella revealed his surprise at how well the game is selling, highlighting how it has become not only the best-selling Dragon Ball game to date but also one of the best-selling Bandai Namco games ever. <em>"One heck of a nice surprise in a year that's been kind of rough overall,"</em> according to the analyst.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success on the market is wholly deserved, in my opinion. The game is not only a massive love letter to the franchise and an incredible tribute to the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly passed away this year, but also a very fun game to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

A year after his split from PlatinumGames, series creator Hideki Kamiya now heads the newly founded studio Clovers and is workiing on Okami 2 as its director. IGN Japan spoke with Kamiya and Clovers President and CEO Kento Koyama to hear all about about how the company came to be and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell us about the founding of Clovers.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I left my former company, PlatinumGames, on October 12, 2023. There were all kinds of restrictions placed on me for the following year, which meant that I couldn't create games [<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-on-why-he-left-platinumgames-his-youtube-channel-and-his-next-game"><u>as reported by IGN in a previous interview</u></a>]. Now that the year has passed, I have finally been appointed as the studio head of Clovers. I'll be developing games at this new company with Koyama as president and CEO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Kamiya was under a year-long non-compete agreement. We wanted to have a clean slate when making games, even at Clovers, so we waited until this restriction was over and Kamiya had entered the company before officially going active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was genuinely unemployed between quitting PlatinumGames and joining Clovers. But once Clovers was formed and before I could announce anything, I decided to quietly add a "?" to the "Unemployed" description on my X account's display name!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/screenshot-2024-12-16-101323-1734344073143.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I wonder if anyone truly noticed, haha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> It seems like a number of X users actually did. They were speculating that I'd be starting something new. I really was unemployed around the time of Tokyo Game Show 2024, so I wasn't lying when I added "unemployed" to my username at the time!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many people are working at Clovers at the moment?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> About 20 people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> The company has bases in Tokyo and Osaka. People from those two cities came to Clovers, and so we started locations in both at the same time. We began in small rental offices, but now they're so full that they can't even fit everyone. We're now working on moving to real offices. The move to the Osaka office is scheduled for February 2025, while the Tokyo office move is slated for spring 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We're thinking of adding new employees together with these moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We already have people who say they would like to work at Clovers, so we need to put a system in place to hire some of them. We imagine that hiring is going to become even more active now that we’ve officially announced Clovers’ foundation [<a href="https://clovers2023.com/en/careers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in fact, a guide to career applications is now available on the official Clovers website</u></a>]. The vision that Koyama and I have in mind is to aim for the company to grow to around 70 people in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Please tell us about what kind of work this new studio will undertake, and what you hope to do in the future.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We're currently focusing on developing a contracted title for a publisher (the sequel to Okami). We'll be focusing on that one for a while, but we'd like to create our own IP at Clovers in the future. That isn't to say that making IP is a top priority of ours, though. What's important is bringing players the most interesting and fun titles that we can.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Okami (@OkamiOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OkamiOfficial/status/1867430362017935809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Our strength at Clovers is that we're a group with a unique sense of creativity. I've never been too fixated on creating only original properties, even when I was at PlatinumGames. When I was there, the company also developed IP belonging to other companies, like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. [Kamiya was not directly involved in developing this game.] Whether it's an existing IP or a new one, our mission at Clovers is to create unique games that only we can make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Recently there are quite a few Japanese companies that have been funded by overseas publishers, but has Clovers taken on any investments?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We haven't received any outside investment at the moment. That was a decision we've made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We were fortunate enough to receive a number of offers, but right now we'd like to see just how far we can go on our own. We want to maintain the freedom to do whatever we want. It is true that it's harder to keep the lights on without taking on investors, but we're doing our best at Clovers to preserve our independence as a studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Mr Koyama, please tell us about your history in the game industry.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I got my start in the game industry at a company called Mario Club [<a href="https://www.marioclub.co.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a subsidiary of Nintendo that conducts debugging and more</u></a>]. I worked there as a debugger, but I never gave up on my dream of being a game designer. I then moved to DeNA where I got to fulfill that dream. After that, I became involved in a smartphone title at PlatinumGames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Koyama was making the predecessor of what would become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/world-of-demons-24-minutes-of-gameplay"><u>World of Demons, released on Apple Arcade</u></a>. It was being developed as a live service game at first, but changed direction mid-development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I left PlatinumGames once World of Demons was no longer going to be a live service game. After that, I was in charge of the games division at the Kyoto office of a company called Donuts, but after a while there, someone I knew from PlatinumGames contacted me. When we met, they said, "You once mentioned that you wanted to work together with Hideki Kamiya, right?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I never had the chance to work with Koyama during his first time at PlatinumGames. But the mere sight of how he worked and the quality of his work did impress me. I kept on thinking what a pity it was that he left the company, so when the time came when I wanted to ask for Koyama's help, I had a mutual acquaintance reach out to him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Through that connection, I returned to PlatinumGames and ended up working under Kamiya for the next three years.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/img-7205-2-1734343903160.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideki Kamiya (left) and Kento Koyama make Cs for 'Clovers' at the IGN Japan office. Photo by IGN Japan.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What did you think when you heard that Mr Kamiya would be leaving PlatinumGames?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama: </strong>I felt that his leaving was a loss for the game industry. Had his games not been fun, perhaps I wouldn’t have thought about it. We can look back on it and laugh now, but at the time, Kamiya looked unusually serious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> It's not as if I was feeling sad about my own future. I felt bad for the company's staff I would be leaving behind by exiting the company and my team, and by leaving my positions as game director and vice president. This may sound conceited, but I was in a position where I shouldered quite a lot at PlatinumGames. From my perspective, I left the company based on my own convictions as a creator, but I'm sure that others also saw it as a selfish act. I felt very sorry about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Kamiya didn't have any plans at all following his departure from PlatinumGames. He was saying things like, "Maybe I'll go back to my family's home and wipe down the floors there." So I said, "If you ever want to make another game, please contact me. I come from a farming family, so let's make games in your free time outside of planting and harvesting rice. I might not be able to pay you a salary, but I can at least send you some rice!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was happy when Koyama told me he'd send me rice. I mean, I was thinking, "How could there possibly be a company that'd take in an industry troublemaker who's constantly spewing venom on X like me?" But maybe this unemployable guy would still be able to make ends meet if Koyama sent me rice. Of course, it wasn't rice he ended up making for me, but rather a company!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How could there possibly be a company that'd take in an industry troublemaker who's constantly spewing venom on X like me?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Mr Koyama, will you mainly be working as a manager as the CEO of Clovers, or will you still be involved in game development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Yes, I will be working as the company's president, but I'll continue to be a game designer as well. While I am new to being a company president, I feel like I've been able to do a good job thanks to the help of the other members of the company around me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I don't know what I'd do without Koyama's ability to handle that kind of work. I'm clueless when it comes to the management side, so my primary job will be creating games. I'm able to let him handle the parts of running a business that I'm not capable of doing myself. I've never once felt concerned. I'm very grateful to have someone like him with talents that even stretch outside of game development. I'd like to rely on him as the company's president, and I also highly value his abilities as a creator, so I have high hopes for his future as a game designer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your studio's name, Clovers, brings to mind Clover Studio, which was responsible for the original Okami and other titles and where Kmaiya used to work. Can you tell us how you decided on this name?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, I come from a family of farmers, so I first thought about a company name that had to do with agriculture. It seemed that Kamiya had some concerns about my ability to come up with a good name, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> His sense for names is rather unique, you see... That's when I proposed that we name the company Clovers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We ended up going with his very first suggestion as-is. At first, I couldn’t help but be reminded of Clover Studio, which Kamiya was previously a part of. We were going out of our way to create a new company, so I was reluctant to have a company name that looked back to the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I may have some fond feelings for Clover Studio because of titles like Okami, but Koyama doesn’t have that history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I was able to empathize with Kamiya's explanation for the name, though. If you break down the name Clovers you get “C” and “lovers." The C in Clovers stands in part for “creativity," something that all of us love. Also, when thinking about the company's philosophy, in reference to a four-leaf clover, we began to talk about being a group with four guiding Cs, as in "C-lovers." Our company's logo is four interconnected Cs in the shape of a clover, as I think you can tell by looking at it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/03-clovers-logo-cpv-1734345911794.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Clovers logo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We decided on three of the four Cs right away: Challenge, Creativity and Craftsmanship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> While things went smoothly up to here, we had trouble figuring out the fourth and last C. Too many positive words that begin with the letter C, so we didn't know which to pick. That's when Koyama had the idea, "How about we don't decide on the fourth C, and leave it up to each of our new members to decide what the final C means to them personally?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> That's why we share three of the Cs as a company, while the fourth is thought up by each of our employees when they join the company, and we have them write down their reasons. Clovers now has a system where new hires choose their own fourth C the day they join the company.

It's always been what has driven me forward in my game design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I made my fourth C "Cleanness," to show my desire to always be sincere in my work and towards business partners. Within the company, you have everything from people who make their fourth C "Century," striving to create titles that will last for a hundred years, to stylish types who made theirs "Coffee Break."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> By having everyone choose their own fourth C, it makes them even more aware of themselves as creators. I think Clovers is a good name for the company we want to become, as it stands for our desire to be a group that loves that fourth C.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami often talks about wanting to focus on helping young talent to bloom. Mr Kamiya, as someone who came up under Mikami, how do you feel about that idea?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was able to work as a director for the first time on Resident Evil 2 thanks to Mr Mikami's guidance. The offer shocked me because it was only my second year after joining Capcom, but within a fraction of a second I told him I'd do it. There's no question that I've also inherited what you might call this kind of "Mikami-ism," and at PlatinumGames I'd actively give direction work to promising young employees even if they didn't have experience as a director. That's why I'd like to continue to give opportunities to young talent at Clovers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your new website mentions that you are recruiting, but what kind of staff are you looking for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We believe that people who can relate to our three Cs – Challenge, Creativity and Craftsmanship – will be a good fit for Clovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I think that things like taking on a challenge, being creative or having a craftsmanlike mentality are not things you only do because you're told to do them. I feel that people who naturally have that kind of mindset and passion for creativity are the ones who fit in with us. In fact, the members who have joined Clovers so far are exactly like that. I hope to maintain that concentration and expand it even further.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/04-clovers-staff-1734345285435.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The employees of Clovers pose for a group photo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't do anything alone. We have team members who draw artwork, others who turn it into 3D models, or who add movement, or who add sound and music, and people who program and finalize the output. Thanks to this combination of people, a game can grow into a wonderful work that exceeds my imagination; miracles are born, and players can enjoy the end result. Just like with game development, as we start a company from scratch this time, I really feel the importance of people's support. The current staff also came to Clovers without knowing what would happen, and I am so grateful to them for that. I wanted to leave that feeling of gratitude in a tangible form, so we took a group photo of all the Clovers staff. It was a sobering feeling once again. I'm sure they are not without anxiety, but they seem to be enjoying the process of building something from scratch, and that makes me feel really confident. I would be happy to create something with people who can enjoy taking on this challenge together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This interview was conducted by Daniel Robson, Chief Editor of IGN Japan, and the article was written by Ryuchi Kataoka, a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <p>Capcom is working on more revivals of its dormant series, the company said following the reveal of new Okami and Onimusha games at last week's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"In addition to regularly releasing major new titles each year, Capcom is focusing on re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently," reads a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">press release</a> to investors.</p>
<p>"The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving past IPs like [Okami and Onimusha], in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles."</p>

<p>It's unclear what form these revivals will take, be it some form of remaster or remake, or a brand new game.</p>
<p>For instance, both the Okami and Onimusha games are new entries in their respective series. But Capcom has also seen great success with its Resident Evil remake games.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel</a> will be developed by Hideki Kamiya's new Clovers studio, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is set to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>The news of these revivals follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">success of Dragon's Dogma 2</a> this year, which helped to boost Capcom's expected profits, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>.</p>
<p>So what could be next? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> is perhaps the most obvious, especially considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">fan interest in a new game acknowledged by Capcom in an official poll</a>.</p>
<p>The original Dino Crisis, a PS1 survival horror game, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dino-crisis-is-now-available-for-all-to-purchase-on-playstation">available for all to purchase on PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p>Could we also see a new Devil May Cry game soon, following the success of the fifth game? Could a new Mega Man game be on the way? Or could Capcom revive another RPG series: Breath of Fire?</p>
<p>Until then, Capcom is busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, due out on 28th February next year.</p>
<p>What series would you like to see Capcom tackle next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prior to Elden Ring's release in February 2022, the entire Dark Souls series had sold 27m copies combined, according to Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. </p><p>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Now, the Dark Souls series has <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Soulsborne">reportedly sold over 39m copies</a>, suggesting Elden Ring has prompted a significant boost in sales of previous games.</p>
<p>In short, Elden Ring has been a phenomenal success for FromSoftware. It's now the 28th best-selling game ever, outselling the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, GTA: San Andreas, and Pokémon Sword and Shield.</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has stated if he'd continued working for Platinum Games his "artistic spirit [would] die".</p>
<p>The former Platinum vice-president has launched a new studio with another former Platinum employee, Kaneto Koyama, as discussed in a new interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2412133p">denfaminicogamer</a>.</p>
<p>The pair have set up Clovers, which will develop a sequel to the much-loved Okami, originally developed by Kamiya at Clover Studio.</p>

<p>"This is purely my personal opinion, but I thought, 'If I continue working here, my artistic spirit will die'," said Kamiya on his reasons for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">leaving Platinum last year</a> (via machine translation).</p>
<p>"I can understand the way PlatinumGames is as a company and its logic, and I was in the position of vice president myself, but as an individual named Hideki Kamiya, I was unable to embrace that way of thinking."</p>
<p>As vice president, Kamiya was "field-first" at Platinum Games - he described himself as the muscle and CEO Atsushi Inaba as the brains.</p>
<p>"The signals sent from the cerebrum are essential for muscles," Kamiya continued. "At the same time, those signals must be reliable for muscles. Until then, I had received those signals, trusted them, and worked to maximize my own strength...but with regards to the future direction of Platinum with Inaba at the helm, I was no longer able to place my trust in them and exert my strength as a muscle."</p>
<p>Kamiya has been quite vocal about his decision to leave Platinum Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">previously stating there were issues of "trust"</a>.</p>
<p>He then launched a YouTube channel where he discussed his next project. "I already have a clear idea in mind," he said. "I would like to translate this vision in my head into a full proposal as soon as I am able to do so. And of course, I also have an idea of what I can do to make the project a reality. But if you ask me specifically what kind of game it will be, all I can say at this stage is, 'It'll be a Hideki Kamiya game'."</p>
<p>It's unclear if that project is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">new Okami sequel</a>, announced as in-development at this year's The Game Awards last week.</p>

<p>In this new interview, Kamiya and Koyama explained the Clovers name of the new studio. It's been interpreted as "C lovers", with four Cs relating to the four leaves of a clover.</p>
<p>Only three Cs are set in stone though: challenge, creativity, and craftsmanship. The fourth C is for employees to decide upon themselves.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Kamiya stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Okami's sales were a "huge failure"</a> and that had the game been more successful Clover Studio probably would have continued.</p>
<p>Little is known about the new Okami game, beyond the above teaser image.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
