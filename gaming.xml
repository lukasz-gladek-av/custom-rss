              <p><span>This weekend is a big one for fans and players of competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. Thousands of fans are gathering in the Anaheim Convention Center to watch the best of the best battle each other in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. However, not everyone is there to have a good time. For some people, the cost of attendance is merely a business expense. Like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-scalpers-happy-meal-toys-japan-2000617978"><span>every other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>event or collaboration</span></a><span> in recent memory, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>descended upon Anaheim</span></a><span> to buy up exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch and then sell it for a profit. I really wanted to go to Worlds this year, as I’ve been a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fan most of my life and still haven’t been to one of the championship competitions, but while the tournament is just beginning, the vibes seem so rancid I’m not sure it would make for a great first impression.</span></p> <p><span>It seems like every other week we here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>are writing about some absolute nonsense in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, as scalpers have made full-time jobs out of buying up cards and collectibles for a quick buck. The controversial practice has become so lucrative for these grown-ass adults that sales devolve into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074"><span>actual acts of violence</span></a><span> or crowds end up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>jockeying to rummage through shelves</span></a><span> like it’s Black Friday. Part of me feels some sympathy for people who have to resort to this because times are tough and it’s easier than hard labor, but especially considering this franchise has probably brought me more joy than any other for most of my life, it really sucks to see that every new event or merch drop now makes me feel so deeply cynical.</span></p> <p><span>The Anaheim event has only been going on for a day, and there are already </span><a href="https://x.com/michmalllow/status/1956092730708516956"><span>reports of resellers setting up shop in neighboring hotels</span></a><span> near the convention center, with others responding by putting up signage </span><a href="https://x.com/predaconspittor/status/1956151255124029911"><span>prohibiting such wheeling and dealing</span></a><span>. Competitive players are </span><a href="https://x.com/NicholasMoffit2/status/1956059599569916167"><span>posting on social media</span></a><span> about selling merchandise for more than they paid for it. What is supposed to be a giant community gathering has become something else entirely, and it’s made it harder to be a fan when you can’t even engage with it without having to push through people with bad intentions.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really really dislike how pokemon worlds has turned from a celebration of competitive pokemon to taking anything remotely valuable and scalping it for a profit.</p> <p>— Tyson Blätter (@T_Blatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/T_Blatt/status/1956007686190866633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Worlds Pokemon Center showing us once again that capitalism ruins everything people love 🙂</p> <p>— Sawyer Melban (@sawyerhatemail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sawyerhatemail/status/1955874877724090578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t understand why some people are complaining that we brought our daughter to the Pokemon Center yesterday.

So it begs the question: Is </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>just cooked as a hobby now? After nearly 30 years, has the franchise’s reputation become so sullied by people who buy its merchandise just to sell it to other people that longtime devotees are leaving it behind? The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise is too far-reaching to really be affected by this phenomenon, which a lot of collectors believe is why The Pokémon Company doesn’t do much to really stop it. Purchase limits on new merchandise are helpful, but they don’t stop scalpers from showing up before stores put cards on the shelf, making multiple accounts to purchase items online, or causing a ruckus at events like Worlds. </span></p> <p><span>You would think constantly being in the headlines for robberies, chaotic sales, and even actual violence associated with your product would be damaging enough to the brand that TPC would be motivated to take real action. But again, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is so prolific that TPC doesn’t actually receive any chip damage from this. A sale to a scalper puts the same amount of money in Pikachu’s pockets as one to a devoted fan. The assembly line will keep going, and unless people stop buying from them, scalpers will keep showing up. As I said earlier, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has brought me more joy than probably any other series. These days, however, that joy is getting drowned out by cynicism every time some event takes place that should be reminding me why I fell in love with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the first place.</span></p>

But for sheer comfort and smooth controls, only two options reached our S tier: velvet pants and a full length skirt.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just a week after its release, Mafia: The Old Country is adding a fan-favorite mode to the game for players to try out that many are sure to enjoy.</p>



<p>The game, which received decent reviews from critics and fans, took the story back to its roots in 1900s Sicily. From the start, the game made a point to change many controversial aspects from Mafia 3. The biggest was to return the series to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-removed-open-world-because-of-mafia-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more linear format</a>, akin to Mafia 1 and 2. Yet, with the returning mode, announced on the game’s official website, that may not be the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-ride-mode-is-coming-to-mafia-the-old-country">Free Ride Mode is Coming to Mafia: The Old Country</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/news/free-ride-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thank you message</a> from the team, Hangar 13 and 2K Games hyped up the future of the gangster series’ fourth entry. To celebrate, the team announced the return of Free Ride mode, which made its debut in Mafia: Definitive Edition. The mode allowed players to ride and drive around the open world and take on a variety of optional missions. Mostly, it serves as a great way to take in the beautiful sceneries, especially now with the Italian countryside. While the game is linear, Free Ride isn’t technically open world like Mafia 3, but it’s a rather interesting addition.</p>



<p>The mode will be available for free at a later date, along with new content for players to enjoy. While details were sparse on the timing and specifics, it does bode well for returning fans. Toward the end, we got some fun statistics on player behavior to look at. For example, 600 million bullets were fired, though only 185 million enemies were hit by them. Regardless of the decent reception, it seems Hangar 13 and 2K Games are planning to stick with the Torrisi family for a while longer.</p>

Playing alone or with friends, you'll enter a circular zone with a vent that dumps out piles of triangles that you then have to transfer into a bucket on the opposite side of the room. You'll have a quota to hit each round before a timer on the wall hits zero, with the quota increasing between rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To keep the cash flowing in, you'll need to devise smart new ways to transfer triangles, using conveyor belts you can buy from the breakroom between rounds to construct inventive triangle-delivering contraptions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

This is a good all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. For gaming, you won't see much of an improvement upgrading to a Core Ultra 9, especially if you plan to play at high resolutions where the GPU makes much more of an impact. However for multi-tasking and workstation and creator tasks, the Core Ultra 9 is superior because it has significantly more cores.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The GeForce RTX 5080 GPU will run any game in 4K</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The RTX 5080 is the second best Blackwell graphics card, surpassed only by the $2,000 RTX 5090. It's about 5%-10% faster than the previous generation RTX 4080 Super, which is discontinued and no longer available. In games that support the new DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation exclusive to Blackwell cards, the gap widens. This is an outstanding card for playing even the latest games at 4K resolution with high settings and ray tracing enabled.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Battlefield 6 Beta Runs This Weekend</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is out in October and there's one final open beta that runs August 14-17. It's shaping up to be a solid game that goes back to its true roots .

Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/system-requirements" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fairly lax requirements</a> for a new release title; EA recommends at last a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU to achieve 30fps at 1080p, although an RTX 4080 or more powerful GPU is recommended for gaming in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check out more Alienware Back to School deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everyone is the DIY type.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's only the second week of its open beta, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is already looking like it'll be the game to take over 2025 with how strong its player numbers are on Steam alone. The second week of the beta has already surpassed <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">400K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and now analyst Rhys Elliot of Alinea Analytics is predicting that the game will hit 1 million pre-orders on Steam, after having already hit over 600K. </p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Elliot <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315">shared</a> a few key data points from Alinea Analytics' tracking of Battlefield 6, like how the firm is claiming that the game has already surpassed 605K pre-orders, and that EA stands to make $35 million in pre-sales revenue. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> is on track for a huge launch this year, if it can stick the landing. </p><p>Some Alinea Analytics Steam metrics for you:</p><p>🎯605 K copies sold via preorder🎯<br>💰Pre-order revenues of $35 million💰<br>🙏2.7 million Steam wishlists🙏<br>📈521 K people playing the beta CCUs📈 <a href="https://t.co/UOlS5L5MPP">pic.twitter.com/UOlS5L5MPP</a></p></div>— Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">Eurogamer</a>, Elliot elaborated on his predictions for Battlefield 6, saying that he believes it will pass "<em>a million in pre-sales</em>," and that the continued success of the game will be dependent on how EA can carry the momentum the beta is building into launch, and if it can stand out among other major shooters being released close to it, like Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>"<em>As we head into the Autumn period there'll be a lot more going on, but as of right now it's on track to do extremely well: the best Battlefield has ever done</em>,<em>" </em>Elliot said.</p>



<p>That said, Elliot is more realistic than EA executives and believes the target <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">'100 million players'</a> is "<em>completely unrealstic</em>." He's also not in agreement with former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, and doesn't think that EA's comeback with the series will be able to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"><em>boot stomp</em>" Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's important not to conflate Battlefield's pre-launch success - even if it will be a big success - with being a 'CoD Killer'. Yes, Battlefield 6 is making all the right moves with these massive maps, a return to the core classes, the destruction. It is also borrowing a lot of things from CoD. Call of Duty is in a bit of a creative lul and an identity crisis, with Nikki Minaj shooting Beavis and Butthead while Snoop Dogg is twerking in the background. It's weird! But it's still a cultural juggernaut, it has a massive casual audience who buy it on autopilot every year. They complain, but they still buy it, and those habits run deep.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly winning over the hardcore FPS crowd, but CoD has that market momentum, the yearly launches, Warzone is there as that big pool for cross pollination marketing and a funnel into Black Ops. CoD has the seasonal content treadmill it's been running for years and years, with streamer partnerships. Whether Battlefield can keep up with that is unclear</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Battlefield 6 does when it arrives this coming October, but in the meantime you can still check it out this weekend during the remainder of its open beta time. And if you're on PC and having issues getting the beta to launch due to Secure Boot errors, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">check out our guide on how to enable Secure Boot on your PC</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Geist" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f0f582defdd5/geist.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone, we like to believe, has a made a secret list for every single console they've ever owned, of weird and/or experimental stuff they either want to, or wished they had, played. Sometimes you get round to them, sometimes you don't. You know the sort of thing. For me, on GameCube specifically, things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/cubivore_survival_of_the_fittest">Cubivore</a> come to mind, and to a lesser extent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/geist">Geist</a>. Yes, Geist! Which means "ghost" in German. Did you know that? Of course you did. Every Geisterjäger or Paranormal-Forscher worth their salz knows this stuff.</p>
<p>Now, Geist didn't exactly set the world on fire when it came out, but to skip over it for its shortcomings — of which it has its fair share — is to do yourself out of a genuinely odd, unsettling and actually quite good game. And, you know what, 20 years down the line from when it originally released, it's perhaps more intriguing than ever thanks to how differently it plays compared to many of its peers.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0mnihry&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Also, Nintendo, you folks should just put it on the Switch 2, because its biggest issue was performance, and that'll sort it. Done and dusted.</p>

<p>Geist was originally released on 15th August 2005 in the US, and was developed by n-Space and published by the Big-N itself. In fact, it had the honour of being only the second M-rated game that Nintendo had published for the GameCube — I mentioned the first above (Eternal Darkness). In the game, you play as John Raimi, a boffin who's also a member of the counter-terrorist tactical team known as CR-2.</p>
<p>When a rescue goes wrong at the outset of the adventure, and a whole bunch of people die in various paranormal ways (so like a standard Tuesday night in Glasgow, basically), Raimi finds himself...well, dead, so he's a ghost now, isn't he? So, he's <em>sort of</em> dead. He has become Geist. And this is where it gets interesting, because being a ghost in a video game is exactly the sort of thing we want to spend our time doing; here, n-Space served up something that dared to be a wee bit unique. Now <em>that's</em> terrifying.</p>
<p>Even now, playing the opening of this game treats you to action set-pieces that look good in a sort of chunky-first Halo-esque way. With how badly games of this vintage tend to age in terms of visuals, I still think Geist is a bit of a looker, all things considered, and it gets underway with some nice explosions, possessions and all manner of Spooky Things™ down at the old Volks institute - where experiments of the supernatural kind are happening.</p>

<p>Luckily, Geist doesn't <em>just</em> go with big explosions and shooting things, or else we wouldn't be talking about it. N-Space decided to consider how, as a ghost, you can do many more interesting things, like possess objects and other characters in the environments which you need to puzzle through, to give us a clever and absorbing game in terms of its mechanics.</p>
<p>That's not to say there isn't any shooting at all — there's a decent amount of pew-pew here, and even some decent boss scraps along the way. Indeed, levels tend to end with a test of your reflexes in this way for the most part, so it's good the bosses aren't turgid. But Geist is much more about being a little extra creative. Whether it's taking control of something like a dog bowl in order to create a diversion, or something a little weirder like possessing a shooting game toy (just so you can then play it), or heck, even soda cans have their uses, it's a blast, and it gets you thinking a bit.</p>
<p>Human enemies with special abilities or weapons can be targeted so as to make your way past obstacles and environmental puzzles; a grenade goon will enable you to blow stuff up, an engineer will be useful to clear paths and so on. Before you haunt a human, though, you'll need to scare the bejesus out of them to make them open to the process...so to speak. This is where your loud bangs, noises, and ability to possess beds so you can raise up like a Scooby Doo ghost out of them, comes in handy. The game goes surprisingly deep with this stuff; you can even take out guards by poisoning them, if you know who's cooking their food.</p>

<p>Add to this the usual gamut of security cameras, computers and things of this nature to take over, and you've got a lovely little playground to muck around in, complete with a novel approach to puzzling and a story that, whilst you're definitely not going to be thinking about it afterwards, does its job in keeping you hooked until the reason behind the entire incident that's turned you into a floating mischief-maker is unveiled.</p>
<p>If there's one place where Geist falls down fairly hard, it's the performance. It's a clunky old beast overall, and the frame-rate is pretty inconsistent. The controls, too, whilst fine overall, annoy somewhat with a sluggish camera speed with no way to change it!</p>
<p>However, with a fun multiplayer mode that sees up to 4-players engage in three ghost-based modes, and a campaign you can whip through in about seven hours max, Geist is still a game that I look back on with much fondness, and one of those hidden gems that actually lives up to the name. Stick this on without knowing much about it, and 2005 you was in for quite the treat. You still will be today.</p>
<p>Now, go on and put it on NSO so I can get our fancy new GameCube controllers out and start haunting faucets again. Do it.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Did you play Geist back in the day? Have any fond (or not-so-fond) memories of it? Make sure to let us know!</em></p>

However, the platform has come under significant scrutiny over reported failures to protect children on the platform, with <em>Bloomberg</em> publishing a major report last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">about predators on Roblox</a> and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleging that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">its research revealed</a> “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” In recent months, Roblox has taken steps to bolster its child safety features, including introducing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">parent accounts</a> that can manage their child’s account and the ability for parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">to block people on their child’s friend list</a>.</p><p>But Louisiana alleges that Roblox’s “deliberate failure to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from well-documented predatory threats, along with its ongoing failure to warn parents and children of the foreseeable dangers posed by its platform, has directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana,” according to the complaint.</p><p>“Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322">Attorney General Liz Murrill says</a>. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-15/roblox-shares-fall-after-louisiana-attorney-general-files-suit?srnd=homepage-americas">statement to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, an unnamed Roblox spokesperson says that “we dedicate substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours. While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing. The safety of our community is a top priority.” Roblox didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Seven lawsuits regarding child predator issues have been filed against Roblox in a “little over two weeks,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p><p>This week, Roblox published <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">a post on its website</a> about why it removes what it describes as “vigilantes” who try to catch bad actors on Roblox by using tactics “similar to actual predators.” One user, who goes by “Schlep” and says on <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep">his X profile</a> that he has contributed to “6 Roblox arrests and counting,” posted screenshots <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep/status/1954255952997478537">on X</a> last week of what he says was a cease-and-desist notice by Roblox.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Remedy Connected Universe is growing pretty rapidly these days, and its latest entry is a <i>Control</i> spin-off known as <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>. In this cooperative shooter, players return to the Federal Bureau of Control’s bizarre and unsettling Oldest House with up to two pals.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135"><i>Alan Wake</i> Devs Plan A Big Relaunch For Failing Co-Op Flop</a></p> <p>Unfortunately, the game hasn’t been the hit many were probably hoping for. Developer Remedy is looking to put some elbow grease into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135">rehabilitating the co-op shooter</a>. But you <i>can</i> play it right now if you want. So let’s get into everything you’d need to know if you want to play it as of summer 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what-don%e2%80%99t-folks-like-about-fbc-firebreak"></span>What don’t folks like about <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Firebreak</i> unfortunately hasn’t satisfied critics or players. Cited issues include a “<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/fbc-firebreak">lifeless</a>” feeling when playing and a bit too much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">chaos and drudgery</a>. It’s a disappointing debut for a game set in an otherwise excellent setting with a decent premise.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-many-people-are-playing-right-now"></span>How many people are playing right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While you may be able to make your own fun in <i>Firebreak</i>, it’s fair to say most people aren’t. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/">SteamDB reports</a> a player count in the low teens, with an all-time peak of 1,992 players. Those aren’t great numbers on PC, to say the least.</p> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>The short answer is <b>yes</b>, <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> has crossplay support</b>. Players can team with one another across other platforms by sharing a party code. So, if you’re a console fan with friends who prefer to play on PC, or vice versa, you can invite each other for some first-person shooting fun in either duos or trios.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618048">© Screenshot: Remedy</figcaption></figure> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossprogression-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have cross-progression support?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news stops at crossplay, I’m afraid. <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at launch</b>.</p> <p>However, that doesn’t mean the game won’t have cross-progression at some point in the future.</p>

 <p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fbc-firebreak-crossplay-support-launch-no-cross-progression">MP1ST</a>, community manager Julian Fondum responded to an inquiry about cross-progression by saying, “Not at launch. Maybe way down the line. It’s a maybe. A lot of things we’re doing on the back end [are] definitely built in the way that we can do a bunch of things down the line when we have more resources and so on.”</p> <p>That sounds promising to me! But as with any feature that hasn’t been confirmed yet, don’t hold your breath. I suspect there are plenty of things on the game’s roadmap that Remedy views as more pivotal for the game than this for now.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of the Remedy Connected Universe and want to see what all the fuss is about, even if the game has failed to impress on launch, <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> </a>isn’t an open-world game like some of the previous titles in the franchise. Instead, it’s a linear action game set inside large, detailed areas that offer some freedom. However, a new upcoming update will add a more traditional open-world mode to the recently released game.</p> <p>On August 14, developer Hangar 13 posted a message on social media thanking players for all the “love and loyalty” following the launch of<em> Mafia: The Old Country</em> earlier this month. But the message also contained an announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-swimming-open-world-baldurs-gate-2000616867"><em>The Old Country</em></a> will get a “Free Ride” mode in a free future update.</p> <p>“Today, we’re excited to confirm Free Ride is on its way,” posted Hangar 13 on Twitter. “Expect some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mafiosi—thanks for the love and loyalty you've shown <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MafiaTheOldCountry?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MafiaTheOldCountry</a> since launch.</p> <p>Today, we're excited to confirm 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐝𝐞 is on its way! Expect some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months. <a href="https://t.co/FqJ3UU9brG">pic.twitter.com/FqJ3UU9brG</a></p> <p>— Mafia Game (@mafiagame) <a href="https://twitter.com/mafiagame/status/1956025890632077319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Currently, <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> does include a <a href="https://youtu.be/YOkZY_CEQg0">“Free Roam” option known as Exploration</a>, but this mode is pretty boring and doesn’t feature enemies, missions, activities, or much to do. You can find and grab missed collectibles and clean up some other loose ends, but for the most part, it’s an empty world devoid of anything to do. That won’t be the case with this new open-world-esque “Free Ride” mode. And while we don’t have any more details about Free Ride in <em>Old Country </em>just yet, we can look at the most recent release in the series to see what to expect.</p> <p><a href="https://mafiagame.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Ride">Free Ride</a> was a mode present in <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-definitive-edition-is-a-great-remake-of-a-clunky-1845182811"><em>Mafia: The Definitive Edition</em>, Hangar 13’s remastered version of the original <em>Mafia</em></a> game released back in 2020. It let players run around the game’s city and countryside freely and added new missions, races, and even some wackier content involving rituals and aliens. It was unlocked after beating the first mission in the game. I would assume Free Ride in <em>Old Country</em> will be similar in scope and scale. If that’s the case, many players who missed the more open-world format of <em>Mafia III</em> will be happy to have something bigger and more free-roaming to sink their teeth into when it arrives at some unspecified date in the “coming months.”</p>

                <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> seem to get that skating is a style thing as much it is a lifestyle. The board itself doesn't make the skater cool, but the bevy of customization options that'll be present at Skate's early access launch certainly will.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> from its developers, customization will be a crucial part of the experience, and it's the first thing players will do upon booting up the game. At that point, players will be able to fine tune many aspects of their avatar, such as their body shape, height, as well as tons of aspects of their face, and more.</p><p>The way that your characters moves when they're off the board--a setting that the developers are calling Locomotion--is also customizable, and you can even select gestures, which can be done both on-and-off-board.</p><p>Naturally, players will also get to trick out their clothes and boards as well, and completing challenges and missions throughout the game will net them a currency called Rip Chips. This currency is used to buy Skate's equivalent of loot boxes and increase what the team is calling a Rip Score, which sounds like an in-game leveling system. Raising your Rip Score will be a surefire way to keep unlocking more customization options, such as helmets, skirts, and shoes for the player, as well as trucks, stickers, and grip tape for your deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295" data-ratio="0.56309523809524" data-width="840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295"></a><figcaption>A skater's gotta grind. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550297,1300-4550298,1300-4550299,1300-4550300,1300-4550301" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"></figure><p>Speaking of, considering Skate will be free-to-play, it will also offer players the chance to score cosmetics via microtransactions. The Skate Shop will accept the game's premium currency, called San Van Bucks, and will be used for direct purchases, not loot boxes that leave things to chance. Alongside the shop, seasons, which are expected to run around three months at a time, and the Skate Pass should also be considered avenues by which the player can get even more cosmetics.</p><p>At the end of the update, the developers behind Skate acknowledge the possibility of sharing custom gear created by other players considering the new game's emphasis on user-generated content. Despite this, it doesn't outright confirm that it will be in the game, at least at launch, saying that when it has "something concrete to share, like a timeline, we'll make sure to let you know."</p><p>Suffice to say, there will be lots of ways to trick yourself and your board out when Skate launches and beyond.

Skate will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, with mobile versions planned to come to iOS and Android at a later time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://kalshi.com/">Kalshi</a>, the US prediction market and market trading platform where millions of people bet on major global and cultural events, including things like <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards">what the game of the year will be this year at The Game Awards 2025</a> has crossed a cultural milestone by appearing in an ad for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The ad is a live-action mock-up of fictional news cycles that follow the events of the narrative in Black Ops 7, and at about halfway through the short teaser trailer, a shot of a Kalshi query regarding whether robots will replace human soldiers in the US military is spotted with 76% of fictional bets voting yes, and the remaining 24% saying no.</p>



<p>Kalshi shared the trailer from its official account on X (formerly Twitter), writing, "<em>Kalshi *hands shake emoji* Call of Duty. Prediction markets and culture are now one.</em>"</p>



<p>There are several claims online that Kalshi has partnered with Activision in some way, but there's no official word from either company that the partnership is any deeper than Kalshi appearing in the trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That said, the prediction market's appearance alone is of some significance, as it's another layer of cultural integration for the platform that hasn't yet been seen, especially at such a high scale as this.</p>



<p>We'll provide an update if it becomes clear that there is a deeper partnership here. In the meantime, you can expect to see more of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this coming week, starting on Tuesday, August 19, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a meme currently going around Bluesky where people are posting their first purchases on Steam. Taking a look presents a neat time capsule, offering a glimpse of who we used to be. It also gives us a chance to compare our gaming habits now with what they were 10 or more years ago — that is, if you’re one of the Olds that’s been around that long. On a lark, I looked at mine and got the thrill of being able to place a date on when exactly my current life began.</p><p>Sometimes, examining your earliest Steam purchases presents as many questions as answers. My very first Steam purchases were made on December 25th, 2010, and were all over the place in genre: <em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, the <em>Left 4 Dead </em>bundle, and<em> Team Fortress 2</em>. I played and enjoyed many hours of both <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and <em>Amnesia</em>, but to this very day, I have never stepped foot inside a <em>TF2</em> lobby.</p><p><em>TF2</em> was not my kind of game. Hero shooters wouldn’t be a Thing for me until <em>Overwatch</em> blew down the doors of my anti-multiplayer shooter bunker and even then, it’s only <em>Overwatch</em>. Not to mention that the stories of <em>TF2</em> voice chat toxicity were the stuff of 4chan legend. My Black, female ass in a voice chat multiplayer lobby in <em>2010</em>? Absolutely not!</p><p>This list has kickstarted memories that I haven’t reached for in decades, but I don’t think I’ll ever understand why I bought <em>TF2</em>.</p><p>My next set of purchases came a few months later in January and February 2011: <em>DC Universe Online</em> and <em>Rift</em>. Why I bought these MMOs makes far more sense to me than my forever mysterious purchase of <em>TF2</em>. Before getting my Steam account, the only computer games I had ever played were MMOs and the<em> Rise of Rome </em>expansion from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578144/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-xbox-controller"><em>Age of Empires II</em></a><em>. </em>(If you want to know how the Roman Empire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/09/21/tiktoks-roman-empire-meme-explained/">became my Roman Empire</a>, look no further.)</p><p>I was a big <em>World of Warcraft</em> player, but by that time, I had grown bored with it. 2011 would have been right between the <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansions, neither of which I particularly liked. I didn’t really jive with <em>DC Universe Online</em> either, but I played it because, of all things, a boy. My boyfriend at the time was super into the MMO, in which you cosplay as heroes who take over when Wonder Woman and Batman are indisposed. Both my subscription and the relationship lasted longer than they should have.</p><p>I remember the buzz surrounding <em>Rift</em>, a new-at-the-time MMO that was supposed to be the “<em>WoW</em> killer” — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft/483876/the-wow-killers-that-werent/">unaware that such claims had been made about many other MMOs at the time</a>. I remember very little about <em>Rift</em>, which is probably why my <em>WoW</em> subscription is more than 20 years old at this point.</p><p>The fact that <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is on this list at all is another mystery. Before it, I had never played any BioWare games nor any narrative PC games. I don’t remember who suggested it to me — maybe my boyfriend, maybe a friend at college. But the presence of this game on this list gives me an exact date for when my life changed as a gamer and a person: Saturday, March 19, 2011.</p><p><em>Origins</em> isn’t my favorite in the series. In fact, it’s the one <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-returning-to-dragon-1844909473">I dread the most trying to replay</a>. (I am mad as <em>hell</em> at the revelation from <em>Dragon Age</em> producer Mark Darrah that EA <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ea-reportedly-turned-down-pitch-for-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-tragic/">refused to fund a remaster of the series</a>.) But it’s the one that introduced me to narrative, choice-focused, and companion-romancing RPGs. It introduced me to my first BioWare romance Alistair Theirin, and as in all things regarding love, you never forget your first.</p><p>Knowing when I bought this game puts me back in a place that I haven’t thought of in literal decades. I played<em> Origins</em> on a tiny desktop computer tucked into the corner of my too-small living room. That was my first apartment with my boyfriend, and I felt grown for the first time, even though I was well into my early 20s. But even though I was cohabitating with a real man, I was obsessed with the pixelated one in my computer. So obsessed that I taught myself to mod just to add more, shall we say, “<em>narrative</em>” scenes between my Warden character and Alistair. There’s even a funny bit of environmental storytelling with this list. After <em>Origins</em>, I didn’t make another Steam purchase for more than a year. The game took over my life.</p><p>The rest is history. My introduction to the <em>Dragon Age</em> series brought me into the <em>Dragon Age</em> fandom. Through it, I would meet my best and longest friends, rediscover my love of writing, and with that instigating spark, start the journey that would lead me to becoming a game journalist — the second-best decision I’ve made in my life. (The first being finally letting go of that previous relationship.)</p><p>I really appreciate that Steam has kept such a thorough accounting of my early activities on the platform because it’s put a date on the origin of the person that I am today. Go look at yours and see how much you’ve changed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760049/steam-first-five-purchases-meme-dragon-age]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It is often said there is no ethical consumption under capitalism but come dream with me of a better world. A world where we could buy something that makes ourselves and society better for having undertaken the transaction, a world where the act of consumption <em>creates </em>riches and resources. A world where I buy a 98-inch television.</p><p>I can see you are puzzled and dare I say even a bit offended? You are perhaps stuck on the apparent contradictions of this stance. Don’t worry, I am not judging you. I merely ask that you grant my ideas a fair hearing before you decide that me possessing a 98-inch TV is contrary to our shared egalitarian values and commitment to leaving a better world than we were given.</p><p>First, let me be very clear about something: I am sensitive to the offensive price of a 98-inch OLED TV and under no circumstances would I buy such a thing unless we made the kind of progress as a society that granted me the $25,000 required to purchase such a thing. It is in the spirit of shared sacrifice that I am proposing to forego the infinite contrast ratios, perfect blacks, and incredible image accuracy that OLED TVs offer in favor of a more democratic or rustic LED panel. Likely produced by a Chinese company in Vietnam by our revolutionary comrades under what I am confident are excellent conditions and offered at a price that is accessible to all, from the highest to the lowest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>When I played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i></a><span>, Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game and surprise dark horse in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357"><span>2024 Game of the Year race</span></a><span>, I couldn’t have anticipated it would reach the level of fandom in which it got cute, </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing?utm_campaign=mouthwashing-launch&amp;utm_source=twitter-steam-discord"><span>marketable plushies</span></a><span>. Its subject matter is very dark, but then again, that’s never really stopped horror games and movies from going down this path. I suppose it shouldn’t be too surprising, then, that its characters are getting stuffed toys, despite the terrible things they all go through in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s brief runtime. What is surprising is that after all this time, the community is not only still debating the game’s horrors and morality…but now, they’ve devolved into going for each other’s throats over a plush of a character named Jimmy reimagined as a cute cat.</span></p> <p><b>Content warning: Sexual assault</b></p>  <p><span>Jimmy is the primary player character in </span><i>Mouthwashing</i><span>. He and his crew have been stranded in space after their freight ship collided with an asteroid, and the game goes over the fallout of the crash and the months that followed. Without getting too into everything that goes down, suffice it to say </span><i>Mouthwashing </i><span>is a pretty harrowing story involving some of the worst things humans are capable of, and Jimmy is the perpetrator of a lot of those crimes. He’s also an unreliable narrator attempting to cover up what he’s done, and the things he’s revealed to have done on the ship put him far beyond any possible redemption.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Jimmy does a lot of reprehensible things in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, and the one that’s perhaps most notable is that the game implies he raped Anya, the lone woman on the ship, who is now pregnant. We don’t need to get into all the repercussions of this act here, but as you can imagine, a lot of </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans are not fans of Jimmy’s. In fact, I’d argue the game’s entire point is to make you hate this guy. He’s the villain of this story, and even if he attempts to do the right thing at the end of the game, that’s not going to be enough for some. Others, meanwhile, do find him compelling as a character whose layered story has a lot of depth. For some who find his actions unforgivable, even believing him an interesting centerpiece in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>’s story goes beyond what they believe to be morally acceptable.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fast forward to August 2025, and a collectible manufacturer called </span><a href="https://www.plushshop.com/"><span>Plushshop</span></a><span> is making a cat-shaped plush of Jimmy. The store has stuffed cats based on characters from anime, TV shows, and video games, ranging from </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>One Piece</span></i><span>. When the company first announced plans to make </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes, those plans didn’t include one for Jimmy, which led to backlash from fans. The company has since removed those initial </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>plushes from its store and deleted any mention of them from its social media accounts. </span></p> <p><span>However, after the shop announced its Jimmy plush as a separate launch, </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>fans jumped on the website to leave negative user reviews saying that given Jimmy’s true nature, he shouldn’t be made into a cute cat plush. That alone is maybe a conversation worth having, but the comments quickly devolved into a toxic cesspool, with some people claiming that those who bought the plush were rape apologists and several comments that, for some reason, included racial slurs. I went to go look at them myself on PlusShop’s website, but the Jimmy plush seems to have been removed. We’ve reached out to PlushShop for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back. In the meantime, screenshots of the reviews have begun circulating on places like </span><a href="https://x.com/SecondHorn31331/status/1955290233789956236"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mouthwashing/comments/1mper2l/the_jimmy_meow_plush_from_plush_shop/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>, but do be warned that there’s some foul language in those links.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As someone who really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>for its exploration of the human psyche and its striking visuals, am I thrilled that its characters are being made into plushes? Not particularly. I do think it’s a bit weird to make those characters cute cats or even just regular toys. It turns a pretty horrific story into an almost absurdist display prop, and even the officially </span><a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/mouthwashing/products/curly-mouthwashing-plush"><span>licensed plush of a man</span></a><span> wrapped up in bandages with his painkillers made into an accessory kind of feels like a parody or shitpost, turning some of the most memorable, horrific imagery in the game into a purchasable gag. All that said, the reaction to this cat plush is so ludicrously overblown and reeks of the kind of “putting fictional characters on trial” nonsense that has plagued discussions around games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Nier </span></i><span>and that I can’t believe we’re still dealing with in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Good stories are built around conflict, and in some of those stories, the perpetrators of that conflict are reprehensible people who cannot be redeemed in the eyes of the beholder. Yes, in </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, one character has committed one of the most vile things a person is capable of. But he is not a real person, and he is not on trial. Liking a story in which people do terrible things is not the same as endorsing their actions, and if that goes over someone’s head, I’m surprised they’re engaging with </span><i><span>Mouthwashing </span></i><span>to begin with considering several of its characters are morally dubious, to say the least. Since some of the comments weighing in on this use racial slurs, I imagine at least some of those people putting Jimmy on trial have larger issues than a lack of media literacy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The root of these kinds of arguments is that there will always be people who don’t understand that others engage with art differently than they do. One thing I’ve learned in my years of writing, reading, watching, and listening to criticism is that you’ll find that there are some people who have different expectations when they voice an opinion about a work. For example, when someone lashes out at a critique, it’s often under the pretense that a critic is trying to “change” something they think is fine. When some fans voice a complaint about a game, they expect the developers to address it in a patch, and so when they see another person criticizing anything, this is the only framework they have for understanding that critique: as, effectively, a complaint to management over an issue they wish to see rectified. </span></p>

 <p><span>The same thing happens with how people engage with characters. Some people only “like” characters if they support everything they do and can stand by them in the end, so the concept of enjoying a character who does reprehensible shit is so foreign to them that it is somehow a moral failing to derive any sort of satisfaction from them, even from dissecting their actions. Because people are so fixated on their own media literacy framework, art that engages in uncomfortable topics will never be free from Tumblr-era moralizing. To people who make these arguments, “problematic” storylines are just problems to be solved, rather than a means of exploring potentially challenging or uncomfortable themes. The curtains were blue. Jimmy was a bad guy. That’s all there is to it.</span></p> <p><span>I didn’t expect to rant about this on a random Friday in August, and I certainly didn’t expect it to be over a toy cat. I really enjoyed </span><i><span>Mouthwashing</span></i><span>, but I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t get too involved with its community, because it sure seems like there are a lot of people in that community who are ill-equipped to engage with the game they’re purportedly fans of.</span></p>

<p>The Mini SSD card isn't and may never be a formally ratified standard, but it does aim to solve a real problem for portable gaming systems—the need for fast storage that can load games at speeds approaching those of an internal SSD, without requiring users to take their own systems apart to perform upgrades.</p>
<h2>Why are games getting so dang big, anyway?</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2680-game-install-sizes/">2023 analysis from TechSpot</a> suggested that game size had increased at an average rate of roughly 6.3GB per year between 2012 and 2023—games that come in over 100GB aren't the norm, but they aren't hard to find. Some of that increase comes from improved graphics and the higher-resolution textures needed to make games look good on 4K monitors and TVs. But TechSpot also noted that the storage requirements for narrative-heavy, cinematic-heavy games like <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> were being driven just as much by audio files and support for multiple languages.</p>
<p>"In total, nearly 17 GB of storage is needed for [<em>The Last of Us</em>] data unrelated to graphics," wrote author Nick Evanson. "That's larger than any entire game from our 2010 sample! This pattern was consistent across nearly all the 'Godzilla-sized' games we examined—those featuring numerous cinematics, extensive speech, and considerable localization were typically much larger than the rest of the sample in a given year."</p>
<p>For another prominent recent example, consider the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/cyberpunk-2077s-mac-port-will-run-on-all-apple-silicon-chips-even-the-aging-m1/">install sizes for the Mac version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>. The version of the game on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG runs about 92GB. However, the version available for download from Apple's App Store is a whopping 159GB, solely because it includes all of the game's voiceovers in all of the languages it supports. (This is because of App Store rules that require apps to have all possible files included when they're submitted for review.)</p>
<p>It's clear that there's a need for fast storage upgrades that don't require you to disassemble your console or PC completely. Whether it's this new "mini SSD," a faster iteration of microSD Express, or some other as-yet-unknown storage format remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer Hero Games, an early investor in Game Science's Black Myth Wukong, announced its own game, CrisisX. It's a post-apocalyptic open world survival crafting game in development for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512880/CrisisX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile devices (Android, iOS) with a launch window estimated in Q2 2026.</p>



<p>In CrisisX, players will explore a massive 1,200-km² open world with up to 5K other players on a single server. This big map features 12 distinct terrains, ranging from Western-style towns and hidden laboratories to snowy mountaintops. Each terrain is filled with unique items, vegetation, resources, and wild animals to discover, collect, and hunt.</p>



<p>According to Hero Games, CrisisX boasts a versatile combat system that offers an array of weapons, including machetes, crossbows, pistols, sniper rifles, machine guns, RPGs, and grenades. They'll need them, too, as the ruined game world is populated by dangerous zombie-like Infected NPCs, including hordes and 'Titan mutants'. Players can even build armored vehicles like M2 Bradleys or WWII-era M4 Sherman tanks to fight over vital resources like oil wells.</p>



<p>To better resist in this harsh world, players may join forces in teams, groups, and communes to seize strategic resource points and expand their territories. While unity offers a better chance of survival against the Infected Hordes and brutal elements, it also inevitably leads to bigger, more bitter turf wars between rival groups. Beyond combat, as befitting a survival game, players must manage their characters' hunger, thirst, and health; every physical activity impacts their strength and attributes.</p>



<p>CrisisX also includes home-building features that players can use to claim territory on the open world multiplayer map and then expand into a bigger, badder homestead with fences, farms, livestock, and more that can repel the Infected. But it isn't just NPCs you need to worry about, as other survivors can raid your home at any time.</p>

Still, much of the species' full appearance remains a mystery, as only a partial skull and teeth have so far been found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body," Fitzgerald continued. Adorable!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Janjucetus dullardi has been placed as a member of the rare mammalodontids group of ancient whales that existed 34-23 million years ago, which later evolved into the humpbacks and minke whales of today. Or in Pokémon terms, it would have definitely been Water-type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The species has been named after amateur fossil hunter and high school principal Ross Dullard, who contacted Museums Victoria after unearthing the skull on a local beach. Confirming it did indeed belong to a previously-unknown species has since taken six years of research — a lot longer than simply registering it to a Pokédex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, however, has finally brought that confirmation — something Dullard says has given him "the greatest 24 hours of my life" and "high fives coming left, right and center" when he was greeted on his high school campus the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's taken my concentration for six years," Dullard said. "I've had sleepless nights. I've dreamt about this whale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, how about returning it to life, Helix Fossil style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Additionally, respawn timers have been adjusted on both Rush and Breakthrough so that defender respawns are now fixed at 12 seconds, having previously been between 6-12 seconds. One other change on Breakthrough makes it so fewer players are needed on an objective in order to speed up the capture time.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush<br>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-last-of-us-multiplayer/">The Last of Us Online</a> was a project that many fans of the series were excited about, since there are still people who, to this day, play the Factions multiplayer mode that launched with the original game in 2013. But Naughty Dog decided it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/">didn't want to be a multiplayer-focused studio, and ended up cancelling the project</a> after years of development work, to the disappointment of fans, and the developers at Naughty Dog who worked on the project and saw its potential.</p>



<p>Including the former game director on the project at Naughty Dog, Vinit Agarwal, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">Game*Spark</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/">VGC</a>), spoke about how one of the reasons he left after a decade with the studio was that he saw "<em>the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer," </em>after his time working on The Last of Us Online and every other project he was on at Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>"<em>My main titles were Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 2</em>. <em>I worked on both multiplayer and single-player.</em> <em>I was mainly in charge of boss battles, and Naughty Dog’s boss battles are generally one-on-one situations. So I wanted players to feel like they were fighting a human player, not an AI, even in single-player. To be more specific, I worked on the final boss in A Thief’s End and the fight between Ellie and Abby in The Last of Us Part II. I used all my knowledge of multiplayer to create the feeling that you were fighting a human. A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer.</em>"</p>



<p>Agarwal has set up a new international studio between the United States and Japan with another Naughty Dog alumnus, writer and former creative director Joe Pettinati, who will be running the US office, while Agarwal will be based in Japan. The official name of the studio has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>This new title, which Agarwal described as "<em>triple-indie</em>," is still early in its development, only being a few months along at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>There’s not much we can say yet, but the new game is a multiplayer game, and we aim to bring the cinematic action we’ve been familiar with from our previous titles to multiplayer</em>," said Agarwal. "<em>We’re already in contact with partners, and we expect to have more information to share in the future</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever Agarwal and Pettinati are working on, it won't look like The Last of Us Online, and it certainly won't feature anything copyrighted by Sony, but it could potentially be the multiplayer game that Factions fans were hoping to play before the official project was shut down. </p>

<p><i>Lies of P: Overture</i> is the long-awaited DLC for 2023’s Pinocchio-themed soulslike <i>Lies of P</i>. Though it functions as a prequel, players will still need the base game to dive into this thrilling additional campaign. But unlike some short and sweet DLCs, you’ll be getting quite a chunk of content to see, ranging from expansive new levels, plenty of fresh weapons, challenging bosses, and continued story development. How long will it take to see it all and what can you expect in the new chapter? Let’s take a look.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-new-weapons-are-in-lies-of-p-overture"></span>How many new weapons are in <i>Lies of P: Overture</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Lies of P: Overture</i> adds 10 new weapons, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-overture-royal-horn-bow-location-ranged-dlc-1851785901">the excellent Royal Horn Bow</a>. In total, you can expect to snag these armaments in the DLC:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Arche’s Guardian (Sword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Death’s Talons (Sword)</li> <li aria-level="1">La Vendetta (Blunt)</li> <li aria-level="1">Lorenzini’s Bolt (Greatsword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Maniac’s Pinwheel (Greatsword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Monad’s Rose Sword (Sword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Pale Knight (Greatsword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Puppet of the Future’s Welder (Greatsword)</li> <li aria-level="1">Royal Horn Bow (Dagger*)</li> <li aria-level="1">Silent Evangelist’s Mace (Large Blunt)</li> </ul> <p>*Though it’s a ranged weapon, the Royal Horn Bow is a Dagger blade type.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-new-bosses-are-in-overture"></span>How many new bosses are in <i>Overture</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Lies of P</i>’s DLC tosses in eight new bosses for you to slay. These are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Tyrannical Predator</li> <li aria-level="1">Markiona, Puppeteer of Death</li> <li aria-level="1">Veronique, Leader of the Sweepers</li> <li aria-level="1">Two-faced Overseer</li> <li aria-level="1">Premetamorphic Green Hunter</li> <li aria-level="1">Anguished Guardian</li> <li aria-level="1">Lumacchio, Leader of the Bastards</li> <li aria-level="1">Arlecchino, the Blood Artist</li> </ul> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-lies-of-p-overture-dlc"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Lies of P: Overture</i> DLC?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Lies of P: Overture</i> is downloadable content that adds to the experience of the base game, so you shouldn’t go into it expecting it to last as long as the main campaign. That being said, there’s still a lot to see here as you work your way through a past version of the world.</p>

 <p>Experienced players with plenty of time with the base game under their belt should be able to <b>finish the </b><b><i>Overture</i></b><b> DLC and see all of its secrets in around 12-15 hours</b>. There’s a lot to do, but having knowledge of how the game works should help returning folks feel pretty comfortable moving through the challenges that await them.</p> <p>For those who don’t have as much experience with <i>Lies of P</i>, or perhaps anyone who has taken an extended break and needs to reacclimate to the game’s mechanics, a little more time may be needed to explore every nook and cranny of this expansive DLC. Even then, <b>most players should be able to clear it in under 20 hours</b>.</p> <p>Of course, things can be made a bit easier by making use of the game’s new difficulty modes. You can now adjust the difficulty to make it easier or more difficult if you’re feeling like you’re feeling overwhelmed or not challenged enough. If things feel just right, though, you can simply leave this set to “Legendary Stalker”, which is the standard difficulty.</p>

 <p>If you’re looking to dive back into this dark and mysterious role-playing world, you’d be making a good choice. <i>Lies of P: Overture</i> is an exciting prequel filled with some of the coolest weapons and enemies in the game, and it expands excellently on the world and lore that dedicated fans have come to adore.</p> <p><i>Lies of P: Overture</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. And again, yes, you’ll need to own the base game to play it!</p>
