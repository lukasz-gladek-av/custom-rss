			<p>Following the launch of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for Game of the Year at The Game Awards), Square Enix is now entirely focused on the third part of the FFVII remake trilogy. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-no-dlc-open-world-minigame-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> there won't be any DLCs for Rebirth to speed up the arrival of the final installment, but what can we expect in that game? Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi talked a bit about his plans in an interview with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-mini-games-naoki-hamaguchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VG247</a>, stating that the goal is to add some sort of different twist to make it a new and exciting experience.</p>
<p><em>I play a lot of games, a lot of open world games, and something I feel whilst playing a lot of these games is that you've got the core mechanics - or their fighting systems - and most of the content you'll encounter, most of the places you can go, most of what you'll be doing, can get repetitive. These games just use the same mechanics. There are no real changes, there’s nothing new to experience around the different regions of these worlds.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, there’s a great battle system in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - and there’s a lot of fun to be had in fighting the various different monsters in each region - but I wanted it to feel like a breath of fresh air when you entered each different region. That you feel like there’s something new and exciting to do when you enter a new area. That you can experience something different with the mechanics. That’s why we wanted to put so many different mini-games in, and I feel we really managed to achieve our goal with that. It’s simply a breath of fresh air in an open world (or ‘open field’, as we call it for Rebirth).</em></p>
<p><em>So, are we going to continue with this same balance going forward? Have we reached perfection? I think if we did just do the same thing again for the third game in the series, then it wouldn’t really be very new or exciting anymore. I want to add a different twist, rearrange things slightly for the next game, and have a slightly different look to things. We don’t just want to make more of the same, we want to make new and exciting experiences.</em></p>
<p>There's no telling yet when the next entry of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy will be released, but it will be at least three years. In the meantime, Rebirth is likely to be released on PC.</p>

Overthrown is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city building game</a> made by and for people who can't work out whether they love or despise city building games. In this curious concoction from developers Brimstone and publishers Maximum Entertainment, you are a chirpy anime monarch equipped with a magic crown that confers the ability to seize entire buildings and throw them away because aaaararargahragrhagh, I am sick of this dang sawmill. I am sick of perfecting the infrastructure. I am sick of stockpiling food for the winter. I am sick of my hard-working peasants and their happiness levels. I am going to pick everything up and hurl it into the sky.

<p>
The crown doesn't just give you superhuman strength. It also lets you sprint so fast that you can run on water. Combine your superhuman speed with your superhuman strength, and you have the means to accelerate the generic business of, say, turning trees into lumber. All you have to do is heft your sawmill over your head and run through the woods, screaming in exhilaration and despair as an entire forest ecosystem disappears into the building's whirling blades.
</p>
<p>

Every action in Overthrown appears to be conducted in the same spirit of nihilistic frenzy. Crops are harvested using spin-attacks and ground-pounds. Land is cultivated by using your shovel like a pogo stick. One way of summarising it is that your character is secretly the protagonist of a third-person action game, ported into a city builder by accident. They don't have time for all this construction and strategy! They've got places to be! Not sure what places, exactly, but still, get me out of here! 
</p><p>
The only problem with that framing is that the actual combat side of Overthrown looks pretty leaden and uninspired, but you don't necessarily have to fight the mutants and outlaws who raid your town. You can just pick up the mutant lair and place it next to the outlaw camp, then watch them murder each other.
</p>
<p>
The last twist in the tale here is that Overthrown is a co-op game, with room for up to six players (there's a moment of throwback joy in one trailer where it looks like they're advertising six-way splitscreen, but don't be fooled - it's online co-op only). Your friends all have magic crowns of their own and as such, are to be regarded with deep suspicion. They will throw your buildings away! Better throw their buildings away first. 
</p>
<p>
All told, Overthrown feels like a great fit for the kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> player who's always itching to push the Godzilla button. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133500/Overthrown/">It's out in early access this year</a>.

                <p>The original Epic Mickey hit consoles in 2010, but if you missed out on the 3D platformer back then, today you’ll find its remake, <a href="https://howl.link/nm746slpqio15?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322051926632?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, discounted to <strong>just $40 (was $60)</strong>.

Along with a fresh coat of paint and HD visuals, Mickey has been granted a new arsenal of special abilities--such as dash and ground pound, along with sprinting. Controls have also been reworked to be more comfortable, ditching the clunky motion controls used on Wii.</p><p>In other words, much of the original game’s spirit remains intact, though it has received plenty of quality-of-life improvements and shiny new graphics.</p><p>If you’re a Disney fan, this game is particularly enticing, as you’ll get to journey through Wasteland-- a dangerous realm filled with long-forgotten Disney characters such as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Mickey has managed to get his mitts on a magical paintbrush that can erase or manipulate parts of the world, and it’ll be up to you to save this unique world from a scourge known as the Blot.</p><p>Best Buy’s deal for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed won’t last long, so whether you’re shopping for yourself or want to cross items off your holiday shopping list, this is the best time to pick up the reimagined game.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 wasn't an immediate hit when it was released in 2020, but it’s only grown more enticing over the years. Along with heaps of patches to improve its performance and smooth out gameplay, it received the impressive Phantom Liberty expansion--starring Idris Elba. If you’ve yet to explore Night City, Black Friday is giving you a chance to pick up <a href="https://howl.link/b0tbz18jwsl65?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322028703458?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> for just $40 (was $60).</p><p>That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen all year for the hit game, and since it includes both the base game and Phantom Liberty expansion, it’s the best way to experience the RPG in 2024. As an added bonus, this version features a few collectible stickers. The deal applies to both <a href="https://howl.link/b0tbz18jwsl65?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322028703458?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/8k83or6z5kcmc?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322043104754?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>.</p><p>One small quirk with this version is how the DLC is offered. If you buy the Xbox Series X version, you’ll get three discs that contain both the base game and DLC. If you buy the PS5 version, you’ll get one disc and a redeemable code to download Phantom Liberty. Regardless, you’re getting one of the best open-world games in recent years--and since GTA 6 doesn’t seem to be any closer to launching, Cyberpunk 2077 is a great way to bide your time.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116">Phantom Liberty review</a> gave it a 10/10, due to its thrilling main story, impressive performances from both the new and returning cast, and rebuilding its core RPG elements to make combat more satisfying.</p><p>“Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best,” wrote critic Michael Higham. “CD Projekt Red has taken the lessons from the original release and focused on the parts that mattered most to deliver a thrilling and impactful experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. And although it fits into the original story, it leaves a lasting impact that rewrote my perception of Cyberpunk's world.”</p><p>For more deals, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday Hub</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Thanks, Parcel Corps, For Letting Me Remember How It Feels To Bike Like A Maniac]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thanks-parcel-corps-for-letting-me-remember-how-it-feels-to-bike-like-a-maniac.1041927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prior to moving back to New York City last spring, I hadn’t ridden a bike in Manhattan much since I was in my 20s, when I had less health insurance than I have today but was also (incorrectly) less worried about getting hurt. These days, I have become the safety-conscious middle-aged man with a bad knee and insurance premiums who shakes his fist at all the other cyclists busting through red lights and riding the wrong way. But I'm enjoying recent indie game <em>Parcel Corps </em>for letting me remember how it (incorrectly) felt to feel invincible.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Parcel Corps</em></a> came out in early October. You play as a bike messenger, choosing a faction and then making deliveries across a busy, brightly-colored city. Speeding along under time pressure, you can grind rails, wall-ride, slide under obstacles, and perform other tricks. I’ve only played the game’s earliest hours, which see you darting back and forth across areas forming relationships with businesses and then delivering their packages, but there are multiple areas and also appear to be different kinds of missions, such as ones that require you to perform certain tricks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Parcel Corps - Release Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogtlwy0OYUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Player reviews for the game are mixed, with some folks taking umbrage with whether <em>Parcel Corps</em> lives up to the legacy of games like <em>Crazy Taxi</em> or <em>Jet Set Radio</em> from which they feel it draws inspiration. I’ll be honest that I haven’t played those games, and also that I haven’t played the game long enough to offer any kind of definitive assessment of its overall quality. If you’re curious about it, there’s a Steam demo I’d encourage you to check out to see if it’s your speed.</p><p>What I have really liked about <em>Parcel Corps</em>, though, is the bright, friendly vibes of its city, and how it encourages you to feel good about riding around like a maniac. That imperative to break the law and violate common sense was what made being a bike messenger the cool kids’ job when I was young, and <em>Parcel Corps</em> captures that ethos with the bonus that, from what I’ve seen, you can’t get injured or injure anyone else. This turns the city into a playground for stupid decisions. Hurtle through a park where pedestrians are walking? Ride the wrong way down the busiest roads? Look at your cell phone while doing all of it? Go for it. The sun is always shining, people are always in a good mood–I’m charmed by the game’s goofy humor–and even though I tend to get stressed out by games with time limits, the chill vibe makes the game feel relaxed even when it’s chaotic.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve biked into Manhattan a couple times in the last few weeks, and I’ve been shocked by how different it feels than my own Brooklyn streets, as well as how much it seems to have changed since I was younger. There’s more bike infrastructure now, which I appreciate, but there are also more different kinds of vehicles on the roads. I don’t want to be anti <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/opinion-worried-about-e-bike-safety-make-the-roads-safer-first" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-bikes</a>, but I have to admit they stress me out: roaring up behind me in the bike lane, speeding the wrong way down narrow bridges, and racing down sidewalks. When combined with vehicles like mopeds that seem to use any lane they feel like, and with the mind-bendingly bad choices inexperienced cyclists sometimes make on <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citi Bikes</a> in my presence, I find a lot of city riding utterly harrowing. Just this week I witnessed the ugly aftermath of a collision between two e-bikes; a few months ago I watched someone on a motorized scooter nearly take out multiple pedestrians by zooming through a firmly red light in a busy tourist area; and the other night I watched a guy <em>with several children on his bike</em> act like he was the only vehicle on the road while cars and bikes with the right of way screeched and skidded to accommodate his choices.</p><p>Look: I used to be that guy who rode like this too. (I still remember a fireman crassly yelling “Nice move, asshole!” as I darted at high speed in front of their truck; I yelled back “It <em>was!</em>” and yes, it was, but jesus christ it was a <em>fire truck</em>, I could have waited.) And I understand the way delivery apps like the kind <em>Parcel Corps</em> sends up <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/10/05/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-nyc-deliverista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivize dangerous riding</a>. As furious as I get watching regular riders make dangerous, terrifying choices for no apparent reason, I think the bulk of the solution will always be making the city safer for cyclists and pedestrians. (*Cough* <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/watered-down-congestion-pricing-starting-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real congestion pricing</a>.) But I also know, or at least remember, the particular kind of joy that can come from making the streets your own, from using the available landscape to prioritize your own momentum. It’s <em>fun</em> to ride like an asshole, even if it, well, makes you an asshole.</p><p>So I like seeing <em>Parcel Corps</em> as a place to let those tendencies and desires loose, a kind of video game power fantasy where you can ride how you want with no consequences. I may have gone from being a cool bike punk to the kind of old man who’s probably a few years removed from wearing a neon safety vest everywhere (no shade: visibility is important!), but I have needs too, dammit. In <em>Parcel Corps</em>, I can bust down highways and slide under trucks and ride on sidewalks like the whole world exists just for me and my bike. And, oh yeah, I guess make deliveries too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nostalgia is a powerful force. Like a gravity-powered tractor beam, it lures us inexorably to the past. Gazing longingly at the seemingly simpler times of our youth. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/why-nostalgia-is-this-years-most-popular-game-mode/">Nostalgia infused media is like human catnip</a>. So, it’s saying something when not even the potent power of nostalgia can make G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="G.I JOE: WRATH OF COBRA | Console Reveal Date| indie.io" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJT1P4bsC0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A side-scrolling 2D beat ‘em up with retro visuals, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra draws heavily on the gamer goodwill engendered by games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>. With a starting line-up of four classic G.I. Joe heroes to choose from – Snake Eyes, Duke, Scarlett, and Roadblock – and a veritable sea of Cobra villains to punch, kick, and shoot through, you’d think this particular franchise in this specific genre would be a match made in heaven. Sadly, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra is one of the lamest 2D beat ‘em ups I’ve ever scrolled left to right through.</p>


<p>Speaking of scrolling, why doesn’t this game do it properly? Beat up all the enemies on the screen and the flashing indictor pointing to the right pops up. Head off in that direction and the screen just kinds of stutters, puffing away like a first-time jogger, dragging itself to the next screen with a lethargic frame rate. Indeed, throughout the game the frame rate drops to prehistoric levels, leading you to wonder whether your PS5 is feeling alright.</p>


<p>And let’s be honest here, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra ain’t much of a looker. Character models are ill-defined and ugly, lacking any of the retro-charm promised. Move-sets are also pathetically limited; a punch, a kick, a running attack, and a special… that’s about it. There’s one gun type that enemies drop to pick up occasionally and that really is your lot. With so little to do, combat is a boring slugathon, fighting the exact same enemies again and again. There’s little required of you and you’ll soon be at the end of the game having hardly broken a sweat. Your console, though, will likely be inexplicably crying as it tries to keep G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra running through those frame drops.</p>
<p>Despite the phenomenal selection of villains that Cobra provides, every boss fight is pretty much identical. A bad guys turns up and unleashes the same cookie cutter selection of moves you’ve already dealt with numerous times. Quite how you make iconic cartoon characters like Destro, Cobra Commander, and The Baroness visually boring and unremarkable is beyond me, but somehow the developers have managed it.</p>

<p>Other than the brilliant cartoon-inspired opening theme-song and spot-on arcade soundtrack, there is little to recommended G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra, even local co-op play can’t drag this one out of the doldrums.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and is now capable of booting and running multiple console exclusives.</p>
<p>The latest version of the only PlayStation 4 emulator that can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/">Bloodborne</a> fairly well is now capable of booting another PlayStation 4 exclusive that is likely to stay so in the foreseeable future, The Last Guardian. The game is not in a playable state whatsoever, as seen in the video below provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, but the fact that the emulator can now boot the game is still impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Guardian New Gameplay on ShadPS4 Emulator" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K5HWrnFevI?start=9&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it will be a while until The Last Guardian will be playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator is more than capable of running other console exclusives like the aforementioned Bloodborne, which obviously was a priority for the developers due to its popularity, Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro and Odin Sphere Leifhrasir, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">Gravity Rush Remastered</a> and others. You can check out how these games, as well as over 50 other ones, currently run on the emulator in the video below put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERNO1INTERNATIONAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GAMER NO 1.</a></p>

			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment will make sure the game will run at the very least at 30 frames per second on Xbox Series X, but this framerate is not its target, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcello696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parris</a>, Game Director Carrie Patel commented on the performance level that should be expected on Xbox Series X, saying that the game will run at the very least at 30 FPS, but this level of performance is not the team's target. As of now, the developer is fully into performance optimization and is committed to delivering a beautiful world at the best framerate they possibly can.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Preview With Game Director Carrie Patel" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzJTfeOjzkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from this statement, it is definitely a good thing Avowed was delayed to February 2025, as the extra time could allow developer Obsidian to spend more time on optimization and deliver framerates higher than 30 FPS at launch. Phil Spencer himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/">commented</a> on the game's delay, saying that the game's quality didn't cause it and that the developer would make use of the extra time it did not need to release the game.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th. You can learn more about what makes the game feel fun and engaging in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/">preview.</a></p>

Most require your input as you quest, grind mobs, and run dungeons with random players you’ll never see again. But <em>RuneScape </em>was unique in providing a stomping ground for players who want to experience character growth with minimal effort. Andrew Gower, one of the minds behind <em>RuneScape</em>, ultimately left Jagex to form Fen Research, and now, his first game, <em>Brighter Shores</em>, is available on Steam as a free-to-play point-and-click MMORPG.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196395,196049" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite Gower’s reputation, <em>Brighter Shores </em>hasn’t been a guaranteed hit with long-time <em>RuneScape </em>players.

It’s still early days for the MMO, and it’s in Early Access, so there’s a lot of opportunity for things to change.</p><p>For now, let’s look at the game’s current status. First, many current negative reviews point toward an overall lifeless experience devoid of typical MMORPG quality-of-life features and strange design choices. One user points out that there’s a cooking profession, yet you can’t eat. Furthermore, many of the game’s negative reviews find fault with how clunky everything feels, as it takes multiple, often unnecessary clicks to do anything.</p><p>But it’s not all bad. There are countless positive reviews—currently more than negative ones—and they paint a better picture for <em>Brighter Shores</em>. Such reviews describe the game as a refreshing experience with multiple updates from the studio addressing concerns promptly and a compelling gameplay loop that provides hours of entertainment without

On PC, the game has ray-traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and other flourishes that really make it pop. On PS5, the game only has the shadows bit, and only while running at 30fps. Getting <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>running with more ray-tracing features might not be worth $700, but it’s certainly the type of luxury people already spending that much on a new console would probably be happy to have. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Valve is currently working on a sequel to the Steam Controller, along with a controller for its Deckard VR headset, according to spatial computing expert and unofficial Valve oracle Brad Lynch, whose datamining frequently <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859475336951460296" rel="nofollow ">uncovers interesting details on Valve products</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Lynch, both the Steam Controller 2 (codenamed "Ibex") and a controller for the currently unconfirmed Deckard VR headset--aptly codenamed "Roy," an homage to Blade Runner's renegade Replicant, <a href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Batty" rel="nofollow ">Roy Batty</a>--are under development at Valve. Per Lynch, both products are reportedly "being tooled for a mass production goal in [Valve's] factories right now."</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization," <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" rel="nofollow ">Lynch added</a> in a post on Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">But Lynch was also quick to point out that "being tooled for a mass production goal" does not mean "currently being assembled at a factory." He noted that <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859291136520536356" rel="nofollow ">it could be up to a year before the controllers begin the process of mass production</a>, but his datamining efforts have left him feeling confident that Ibex, Deckard, and Roy are all legitimate products that Valve will soon bring to market.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of Lynch's datamining appears to have revealed the inputs for the "Roy" controller, which appears to be highly customizable.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Datamining SteamVR’s client gave us deeper info of every input that is currently assigned to Valve’s Roy VR controllers</p><p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/ShinyQuagsire?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShinyQuagsire</a> ! ❤️</p><p>(Touch means a button has capacitive sensing)</p><p>All inputs assigned to Roy:</p><p>Left Hand Controller:</p><p>#… <a href="https://t.co/Ggyk03HEog" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/Ggyk03HEog</a></p></div>  — Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Valve, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied Lynch's findings.</p><p dir="ltr">When Valve debuted the original Steam Controller in 2015, it was an ambitious attempt to bridge the gap between console-style controllers and the precision of a mouse and keyboard. Its defining feature was its dual trackpads, which provided a then-unprecedented level of customizability for controller input. The Steam Controller's design was polarizing: Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/grye8u/when_did_you_realize_you_fell_in_love_with_the/" rel="nofollow ">praised its innovation</a>, while others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/47t05o/support_guys_wtf_this_thing_sucks/" rel="nofollow ">found it difficult to use</a>, especially for more traditional gaming experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, the Steam Controller was instrumental in furthering Valve’s vision for SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system designed to run on Steam Machines, which themselves struggled to gain traction in the market. However, Valve’s move to focus on the Steam Link, Steam Deck, and <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloudgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Cloud Gaming</a> ultimately left the Steam Controller largely forgotten, relegated to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/1fl59cz/absolutely_in_love_with_the_steam_controller/" rel="nofollow ">niche community of loyal enthusiasts</a>.</p><p>The Steam Controller 2 represents a chance for Valve course-correct, addressing previous shortcomings while capitalizing on new technologies and gaming trends. But Valve's not the only company working on a new Steam-focused controller--Hori recently unveiled its new Steam controller, known as the Wireless Horipad for Steam, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horis-official-steam-controller-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon-ahead-of-holiday-release/1100-6527594/">currently available for preorder</a>.</p>

			<p>The latest Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/">the biggest one yet</a>, and the team has been working towards making some huge changes both in graphics and in gameplay. For the most part, this Title Update has had a significant focus on combat and stealth to allow the player to have more control of their decisions, as well as allowing players to keep hold of pick-up weapons for longer. For those who may be getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws, this is how big the update is on each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 7.44 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 10.18 GB</li>
<li>PC: 8.83 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notable changes have been made with the latest Title Update in Star Wars Outlaws. Especially when it comes to the stealth and combat options in the game, by updating stealth and combat, players now have more choices to make and can adapt their playstyle accordingly. This includes using stealth or reaching for your blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</p>
<p>In conjunction with stealth and combat, enemy AI and detection have been improved. Players are now notified when they're being detected, giving them a choice between breaking stealth and engaging in combat or finding a way to change tactics to remain in stealth. Another layer has been added to the combat system, which involves enemy weak points being added to Star Wars Outlaws. This is so that players who engage in strategic gameplay are rewarded for their efforts, leading to the enemies to die in comedic new ways.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the efforts to fix combat, Kay's blaster and pickup weapons have been re-tuned so that the combat experience is smoother and more enjoyable. This includes the option to carry two-handed weapons more frequently throughout the game.</p>
<p>For many people, the animations and character design is what threw them off, as the characters do have a touch of uncanny valley. The developers for Star Wars Outlaws continue to work on this, with facial expressions and animations now being improved in dialogue scenes. This also comes with a new option to toggle the cinematic lens during gameplay, as well as distant lights being more visible when traversing through the game.</p>
<p>These are only the highlights of what was added in this Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws, and the patch notes carry on for quite a while. You can read them in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2842040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded blog post</a>, which goes into detail about everything that has been changed in the game.</p>

There will be a lot to unpack about the state of Ubisoft’s open-world stealth adventure in the days and weeks ahead but the most important thing to know right now is that the game is ditching its most annoying feature. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,195358,196358" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At launch there were many missions in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, especially early on, where getting spotted by guards instantly resulted in failure. The word “caught” would flash in giant letters onscreen and you’d be started at the last checkpoint, which was sometimes surprisingly far back. No more. The latest developer diary explaining the game’s post-launch journey details why the developers nixed this feature and replaced it with the option to shoot your way out whenever the need arises. </p><p>“Our first step in expanding player choice is removing forced stealth from almost all quest objectives,” recently appointed creative director Drew Rechner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/4U9vshW5I0KpPRJFhQspn2/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-3-the-scoundrels-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote over on the game’s website</a></span>. “This doesn’t mean that sneaking is no longer a viable or even preferable option in some cases. Rather, if you’re caught while sneaking, the objective won’t fail and reset you to the last checkpoint. Instead, you’ll seamlessly transition into combat.” </p><p>There are three other important changes that build on this more <em>Deus Ex</em>-style immersive sim gameplay. First, players can now shoot their way through unfriendly syndicate districts instead of being required to sneak through them. Second, weapons picked up and used in the field will remain accessible for a longer period of time. Third, headshots now do additional damage, and players will be able to target specific body parts for bonus damage on other weak points. </p><p>Combined, it should all help to grease the wheels for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to feel a bit more natural and free-flowing than it did with its more punishing, stealth-centric framework from a few months ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-hit-50-million-peak-viewers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed by Riot Games that the League of Legends Worlds final, which took place on November 2 in London, secured a whopping 50 million peak viewers worldwide. This number was driven mostly by esports fans in China.</p>



<p>That figure includes an all-time high for esports viewers outside of China, the company revealed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-perspective">Into Perspective</h2>



<p>To put that figure into perspective, this year’s NBA Finals pulled in a peak viewer count of around 12.3 million users across the United States. The Super Bowl, which was held in February 2024, racked up a total unique viewer count of 120.2 million people, averaging a peak of 38.5 million.</p>



<p>The data was <a href="https://x.com/lolesports/status/1859295721956024521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided by Riot Games on social media</a> via Stream Hatchet.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship final is widely considered one of the best events in <strong>many years</strong>. It was a spectacle to behold, with live performances taking centre stage at the O2 Arena in London before T1 and Bilibili descended upon their stations to compete in front of a sold-out stadium.</p>



<p>The closing moments of the match were nothing short of legendary, and it marked a <strong>fifth </strong>Worlds win for both T1 and Faker.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers and buzz on social and streaming platforms, the grand final fixture was one of the most popular (if not <strong>the most</strong>) esports matches in the industry’s history. Nothing before has topped the grandiose profile of the full series, and it’s unlikely anything will again – for a long time, at least.</p>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship continues to grow. It’s the number-one esports event of the year, and it’s a perfect example of the ever-developing power of the esports market.</p>

<p>Another games studio is letting go of staff. Heart Machine, the developers behind Hyper Light Breaker and its predecessor Hyper Light Drifter, have confirmed that its holding layoffs.</p>



<p>First reported and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, the Los Angeles-based studio didn’t give a specific reason for the layoffs, nor did they confirm how many people are being let go. However, it will be providing severance and healthcare to those being let go. </p>



<p>It was also affirmed that the upcoming launch of Hyper Light Breaker won’t be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>“Hyper Light Breaker’s&nbsp;upcoming launch will not be impeded by this sad news–in fact, a strong and timely launch will rekindle opportunities for those affected as we look to evolve and grow the game throughout Early Access. Our other projects, including&nbsp;Possessor(s), will also remain unaffected,” studio community and PR manager Yiyi Zhang told Game Developer.</p>







<p>Zhang continued: “We really appreciate our communities who have rallied in support of our studio and others in similar positions, and are hopeful for what’s on the horizon for our upcoming games, our colleagues, and the industry as a whole.”</p>



<p>Though an exact date hasn’t been announced, Heart Machine is planning to launch Hyper Light Breaker in early access sometime in 2025. The game was originally scheduled to release in late 2024 before being delayed in August.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen more that 14,100 known jobs lost due to layoffs in 2024. The real number, according to some sources, could be as high as 16,000 to even 17,000.</p>

                <p>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the latest in the beloved RPG series, and the second to star new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. If you haven't caught up with the latest misadventures of everyone's favorite big-hearted dumbass, now is a great time, as Amazon has it for $25 (marked down from $70) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Like A Dragon series is the new title for the former Yakuza series, which shifted with the release of Ichiban's debut in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. That game also shifted the series to feature turn-based RPG combat, as opposed to the Yakuza series' action-oriented approach. Infinite Wealth brings back the turn-based combat, but with a new twist that adds free movement as well.</p><p>Infinite Wealth tells the story of Ichiban trying to help former Yakuza members reform and get their lives together after the dissolution of several Yakuza clans. Like previous games, it takes place mostly in Japan, but this time, it also has Ichi building up a community in Honolulu City, Hawaii.</p><p>For even more great deals on games, movies, collectibles, and more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">all of our Black Friday coverage</a>.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3AT6I6s" rel="nofollow ">Black Friday Gaming Deals at Amazon</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/what-gamemaker-s-25-year-run-tells-us-about-the-game-engine-market<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this month </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en">GameMaker Studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer YoYo Games celebrated its 25th anniversary. If it were a person, not only would it be old enough to get served at a bar, it'd be old enough to quit its day job and pursue its dreams of becoming an indie game developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words: it would be the kind of person who might be using GameMaker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's that kind of person (no matter their age) that makes up GameMaker's core userbase, CEO Russell Kay said in an interview with Game Developer. 30 years ago, he was programming on games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lemmings 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and now wishes he had a tool as sophisticated as GameMaker when he was getting started. The tool's so flexible it can be picked up by newcomers to learn the basics of game development, and also be a viable engine for commercial titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en/showcase/fields-of-mistria">Fields of Mistria</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://50games.fun/">UFO 50</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and of course </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en/showcase/undertale">Undertale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. YoYo Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219220/GameMaker_25th_Anniversary/">even made its own studio simulation game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to commemorate the anniversary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That YoYo Games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opera-opens-new-video-game-division-and-confirms-yoyo-games-purchase">which is now owned by Opera</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) has survived 25 years is an accomplishment on its own: that is has done so by supporting the video game industry's smallest studios is nearly a miracle. It reached that milestone after a year of major turbulence within the game engine sector—one that began with Unity announcing a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-apologizes-to-devs-reveals-updated-runtime-fee-policy">Runtime Fee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" that would charge developers on a per-install basis, and ended with it sheepishly rolling back the plan as more developers decamped for engines like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-founders-had-desperately-hoped-unity-wouldn-t-blow-up-">Godot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-spent-205-million-eliminating-25-percent-of-its-workforce">Unity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Unreal Engine maker </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-lays-off-nearly-900-staff">Epic Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also both laid off hundreds of workers in that time period, running headlong into the reality that the service provider business is not the infinite money pool some had thought it would be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With turbulence like that, what can these studios and other tool providers learn from GameMaker's long-running success?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="GameMaker's lasted so long by supporting devs with big dreams">GameMaker's lasted so long by supporting devs with big dreams</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our chat, Kay admitted that GameMaker isn't the most sophisticated development tool on the market. That's partly because its users largely aren't programming wiz kids. He called it the "bedrooms to billions" mindset—with an emphasis more on "bedrooms" than "billions." "You have kids being able to take their ideas to a larger audience...it's the creative side, it's not necessarily the business end," he said. "It's not about trying to make the next Call of Duty, it's about thinking about the box and asking 'what's going to work?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The GameMaker developer community, he said, is largely filled by those "creative" developers trying to wrangle big ideas, bolstered by a supportive "technical" community that digs around in the tool and explores solutions to bring those ideas to life. The business case for working with this kind of audience is that as they learn to grow and trust GameMaker. They bring the tool with them out of their academic or hobbyist days and into their professional careers. "We would like people to not just think of GameMaker as something they picked up at school, tried, and moved on to proper game development," Kay said, going on to say he wants developers to be thinking that "GameMaker is a series tool used by serious products, and it's well worth looking at."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via YoYo Games.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the greatest forms of support any small developer needs is the ability to ship their game—big or small—across platforms beyond PC. Kay said when he joined YoYo Games in 2009 as chief technical officer, the tool only supported PC products, and bringing any game to Mac, Linux, console, or burgeoning mobile platforms required extra work. Kay recalled that there was a shift in thinking at the company after Derek Yu released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spelunky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game he prototyped in GameMaker but couldn't finish due to the platform limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of Kay's first major goals was to bring support for those platforms to GameMaker as fast as possible. The timing was perfect, especially with the mobile market about to positively explode with the kinds of 2D games GameMaker is good at producing. In the years since the company has been aggressive in keeping the engine current with new and emerging platforms, ranging from the PS Vita to the growing use of WebGPU.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's how we've been sustainable," he said. And all the while, the engine's remained "fairly stable," and today works roughly the same way as it did a decade-and-a-half ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can still open a tutorial from 15 years ago and it will </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>mostly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> work," he said, glancing aside to try and recall exactly what had been made obsolete. "There'll be things that are wrong in it, but it will mostly work."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How should toolmakers be supporting game developers?">How should toolmakers be supporting game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since GameMaker debuted, the tool provider market for game developers has exploded in growth. Many software companies have sought stability by selling metaphorical shovels to metaphorical prospectors heading out to the metaphorical gold rush instead of setting out for them thar hills themselves. Many of those toolmakers are now pitching services that run on generative AI, promising developers that they can save time and money with generated assets and code—but many of them miss the mark, sometimes delivering </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models">vastly inferior products</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A creative, not-very-technically-inclined audience would be the prime candidate for such tools, right? Not necessarily, said Kay. Working with this userbase has taught him that these developers aren't always looking for the best or most efficient technical solutions. Plenty of toolmakers can mistake what they think developers need versus what they actually need, and create software that slows down the game development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's being aware that you're optimizing for the right thing," he said. For instance, an AI tool that could generate 10,000 assets sounds useful, but it's not useful if you don't know what 10,000 assets you need.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also helpful to remember chasing technological advancements isn't always the right move. Kay described how games made in GameMaker don't bear any stigma that sometimes comes with unrefined Unity or Unreal Engine games, because players can't immediately spot a "GameMaker game" at a distance. "It's actually quite difficult to look and say this game is made in GameMaker these days, because... you'd be surprised at the sorts of games which are actually coming through."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because Unity and Unreal have baked-in lighting and traversal solutions, developers are sometimes locked into a certain "look" or "feel" of a game that players can unconsciously detect. When developers have resources to break away from that kind of "game feeling," or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>want</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> their game to look and feel like the kind of game those solutions are optimized for, it's great. But Kay said it's sometimes more difficult to "break out of the creative box" in a 3D game engine versus a 2D one like GameMaker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't expect any AI features in GameMaker any time soon, by the way. Kay said YoYo Games is "experimenting" with the technology, but hasn't found any immediate solutions ready for the game production pipeline just yet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How did Unity's Runtime fee fiasco affect GameMaker?">How did Unity's Runtime fee fiasco affect GameMaker?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After Unity sparked a mass uproar among its users with the proposed Runtime Fee, GameMaker announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamemaker-expands-with-more-free-options-replaces-two-subscriptions-with-one-time-fee">a price change</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of its own: one that made the engine free for more users and ditched subscription plans targeted at smaller developers in favor of a one-time transaction. The changes were met with open arms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Did YoYo Games make these changes because Unity had sent many developers rushing to find new tools? Kay said the answer was "no," that the changes were in the works months before Unity turned the indie game development world on its head.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, he sheepishly admitted, YoYo Games did "hold off" on announcing its new plans as they waited for the fallout from Unity's move to settle. He said the company has seen a "big spike" of new users in the year since. "There's a greater appreciation of other game engines, and that there is more choice out there than just Unity. [We're seeing] a distrust of large companies and people wanting to have something that's simpler and easier to get their head around."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, Kay said YoYo didn't experience the same phenomenon Godot did, where developers cracked open the tool and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-founders-had-desperately-hoped-unity-wouldn-t-blow-up-">expected it to work just like Unity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Because GameMaker bore fewer similarities, there was less pressure on it to meet its competitor's standards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via YoYo Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he keeps in touch with the teams that oversee Godot, and that the two engines aren't exactly jockeying to fill a vacuum. Godot's open-source framework, he said, is informing how YoYo Games thinks about GameMaker's future. The company has already made some portion of its engine open source, and will likely do the same for more features in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is a model that I think that engines need to adopt, because studios need to be able to have that ability to make bespoke versions for a particular game," Kay said. "It's a way to make optimizations that work for them, not necessarily for everybody."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There will always be some elements that YoYo has to "keep to themselves," but he sees his company's closed source--&gt;open source approach, and Godot's open source--&gt;closed source structure (with the forming of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/w4-games-nets-15-million-to-help-godot-scale-exponentially">W4 Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as being key directions for the future of the game engine landscape.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="No tool can be for everyone, so make the one that's right for your users">No tool can be for everyone, so make the one that's right for your users</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not enough to say that GameMaker made it to the 25 year mark by simply embodying a "slow-and-steady" approach. YoYo Games' ambitions have been humble, sure, but plenty of humble companies die on the vine. It's more accurate to say the company has been careful with its ambitions, and far more precise with areas it's picked to grow quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of abandoning the indie idea of 2D game development, the company has built a business helping developers get their 2D games in as many places as possible. Kay said he's keenly aware that the game engine marketplace has a low ceiling, which led the company to keep its headcount as small as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe there's something to how it views its relationship with game developers just getting their feet off the ground. Unity and Unreal are now so embedded in professional game development that their pitch to juniors and students could sometimes be described "learn to wield the same tools used by the pros."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But GameMaker's sales pitch isn't so much aimed at the aspiring professional, but the wide-eyed dreamer. Maybe if more toolmakers want to hit the 25-year mark, they should think about talking to those dreamers themselves.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>Among Ashes is going to be available from December 9th on PC via Steam and PS5, Rat Cliff Games has confirmed today. It was just a few weeks ago that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/among-ashes-has-been-confirmed-for-ps5/">Among Ashes was confirmed for PS5</a>. To celebrate this milestone, the studio has released a brand new trailer of the game where the horrors of videogames and reality clashes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFBzqIK4Q9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Among Ashes is a bit of a layered game in which players have to play a haunted videogame, called Night Call, and keep playing it until the very end. This means that in the game, your character will boot up the haunted game to play that and get through its challenges. In Night Call you will come across various monsters to fend off, but in the “real world” of Among Ashes the horrors are much more subtle and darker, delving more into psychological threats. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">demo available now on Steam for Among Ashes</a>, if you are in the mood to play a haunted video game.</p>
<p>Rat Cliff Games are self publishing the PC version of Among Ashes, while new publisher Dojo System will be publishing the PS5 version of the game.</p>

One of those buried features that’s genuinely useful, and yet almost no one seems to know about, is wishlisting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192995" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Pokémon Scarlet And Violet’s ‘Free Exploration’ Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up To Be" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="117" data-playlist="192995,196663,193974" data-current="192995"><div><p>Pokémon Scarlet And Violet’s ‘Free Exploration’ Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up To Be</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192995/192995_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192995/192995_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192995/192995_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192995/192995_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18456.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>We already know that trying to complete the Pokedex for the mobile game’s first set, Genetic Apex (which still sounds to me like the evil scheme the Nazis would be up to in a <em>Wolfenstein</em> game), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">is close to impossible</a></span>. But ways to know which of the less fancy, more easily gained cards are missing from your collection would be nice. It turns out, there <em>is</em> a system for that, and while it could be a lot more useful, it really helps when it comes to choosing Wonder Picks.</p><h2 id="h238096"><a id=""></a>How to wishlist cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-recommend-id="image://c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-recommend-id="image://c7cee7dd8b28fa4a543f8b5f63779212" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, this is a bit convoluted, but you’ll be glad you did it. To find <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s bizarrely buried wishlisting option, you’ll want to head to your collection, the My Cards page, which is the second option of the five tabs at the bottom of the main screen.</p><p>However, this page defaults to hiding which cards you don’t yet have, so you now want to tap the entirely unlabeled, anonymous toggle near the top, to the left of the search button. That done, your collection now shows all the empty spaces for cards you’ve yet to gather. In the spaces where a card is missing, you’ll instead see its card number on a gray background.</p><p>Tap on one of those gray tiles and where it would usually show you the larger version of your card, instead you’ll see the back of a card with the words “Not obtained” across the middle.  But now, top right, you’ll also see a gray outline of a heart, with the <em>teeny </em>word “Wishlist” below.</p><figure id="" data-id="e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-recommend-id="image://e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-recommend-id="image://e2c42e249ccf90c1831e29aae44ff364" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A not obtained Pokemon card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tap the heart and it’ll turn pink, and you’ll be told (disappearing before you can read it), “You wishlisted this card. You will see a wishlist icon on this card in wonder picks.”</p><figure id="" data-id="3577fb36b8f9cdf21639e93ebb03fc46" data-recommend-id="image://3577fb36b8f9cdf21639e93ebb03fc46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wonder Pick screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Wonder Pick screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3577fb36b8f9cdf21639e93ebb03fc46" data-recommend-id="image://3577fb36b8f9cdf21639e93ebb03fc46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wonder Pick screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And that’s why this is so useful. Now, if you head to the Wonder Pick page (the first tab, then the option bottom-left), any card that appears in any of the available packs that you don’t yet have will be marked with a pink heart, top right. This makes life <em>so</em> much easier when selecting a pick, saving you from having to go back and forth between tabs, or trying to hold it all in your memory.</p><h2 id="h238097"><a id=""></a>What wishlisting doesn’t do</h2><figure id="" data-id="0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-recommend-id="image://0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-recommend-id="image://0ebc203997b061ad3ea60a477921e5af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="No gaps in a collection of alt-art cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This feature could be a whole lot better. The most immediate way would be for it to also add the wishlist hearts to cards in the equally buried <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange</a></span>. Why it doesn’t is frankly mysterious, given it’s exactly where it’s needed most. Switching back and forth between this and your collection is even more frustrating, because it’s so many silly taps apart, and the Pack Point Exchange doesn’t even have the quick-scroll button that every other screen features!</p><p>Another peculiarity is that when you flip that toggle to show missing cards, it only works for the main set, up to 226/226, Lt. Surge. Once you enter the territory of alt-arts, cards 227 to 286, it doesn’t show the gaps at all. This is maddening! It means there’s no way to wishlist any of these cards!</p><p>Hopefully, as the game gets patched, such oddities will begin to be ironed out, and perhaps the game will even tell people that wishlisting exists at all!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
