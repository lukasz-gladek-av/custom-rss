<p>Three hours of gameplay of the Until Dawn remake has leaked online ahead of the game’s official release on October 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2265248394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikolai7PT</a> leaked the three hours of Until Dawn Remake gameplay during a live stream on October 1, with the VOD still available to watch on his channel. </p>



<p>As expected, the VOD was soon posted to the /r/GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit, where the game was criticized for being full-priced. User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BARD3NGUNN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/u/BARD3NGUNN</a> said, “I mean if Horizon can redo all it’s graphics, add in Duelsense features, and rerecord over 10hrs of motion capture to bring cutscenes upto modern standards and charge $10 to existing players, then realistically Until Dawn should have done the same.”</p>



<p>He continued, “It’s a great game, but there’s nothing this remaster can really do to improve the gameplay considering the limitations of the genre, and they’ve not expanded the story, so you’re basically left with a remaster of an interactive movie that’s releasing alongside the likes of Silent Hill, Dragon Ball, and Metaphor (all around a similar price physical) – it’s really a hard sell.”</p>



<p>In September, Until Dawn Remake developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">Ballistic Moon announced </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">hat the studio had faced layoffs</a>, affecting an undisclosed number of developers. </p>



<p>Until Dawn currently has a film adaption in the works from PlayStation Productions and Sony’s Screen Gems, which is believed to be in early production.</p>



<p>In our guide here, you can see all <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29 trophies coming to Until Dawn</a>.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, video games are complicated pieces of art. They have multiple layers of intertwining mechanics and themes and inspirations that are almost impossible to summarize unless you open with “okay so, this is a lot but basically…” and pray the person you’re talking to is a really good listener. Other times, though, video games aren’t like that at all. They’re like <em>Kill Knight. </em>You’re a knight. You kill. Done. I didn’t realise how long it’s been since I’ve had a simple, smooth, endless action game to sink my teeth into, but <em>Kill Knight </em>quickly reminded me<em>. </em>Combining the addictive “one more run” mentality of <em>Downwell </em>and <em>Devil Daggers </em>with <em>Hades-style </em>lightning-reflex combat and a sleek yet violent aesthetic has resulted in one of the most electrifying games of the year.</p>
<p><iframe title="KILL KNIGHT |  RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6IXLFc0L4z0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s an obscure RPG-inspired artbook series I’m in love with called <em>Vermis. </em>Sold as a lost player guide to a forgotten roleplaying game, it’s full of haunting medieval-fantasy art where something is just always kind of… <em>off. </em>I’ve never seen that uncomfortable yet alluring aesthetic replicated anywhere else until I started playing <em>Kill Knight. </em>Menus and UI are sharp, yet the art and visual accompanying them give off a violent, zine-style setting where you have no idea where you are or what you’re doing but you still can’t help but love it. It’s a game full of barely comprehensible monster designs, equipment covered in spikes and blades, and menu backgrounds lifted straight from screen-printed sludge metal band shirts. I see a lot of new games come out where the mechanics are sharply defined or uniquely inventive, but they lack any sort of visual identity that matches that creativity. <em>Kill Knight </em>delivers on both.</p>


<p>Your goal is simple – survive wave-based combat in a constantly evolving arena, and if you do, you’ll unlock another arena with new visuals, enemies, and hazards to tackle. You’ve got a pretty simple set of abilities to use in order to achieve that, but they all feed into each other in a circular loop that keeps your brain firing on all cylinders as you play. You’ve got a standard gun attack, and when you need to reload you can tap three different buttons to activate three different Overdrive abilities.</p>


<p>Tap the fire button to Overdrive your primary weapon and activate a bonus ability, tap the melee button to activate a buffed melee attack, or tap the Absorb button to instantly suck up every dropped gem on the field. You can melee whenever you want, too, and melee kills earn you ammo for your heavy weapon. Absorbing can be done at any time at a slower rate, and when you absorb enough, you can unleash a special Heavy attack that will drop health pickups from anything it hits. Add on a quick-dash and a melee parry, and you’ve got a combat system that’s simple on paper, but complicated in execution.</p>
<p>My first few runs were rough. I’d focus too much on one attack type, or get so caught up watching enemy behaviour I wouldn’t even realize they had me overwhelmed until it was too late. When you’re on your toes and racking up kills, the combo meter isn’t just for flair – it feeds into a system that buffs all of your abilities the higher your racked-up combo gets. Systems like that where your score and combo are directly tied into beneficial gameplay systems, rather than just being for glory and bragging rights, are one of my favourite things to see in games. I rarely care how high my score is or how sick my combo gets, but when that stuff directly helps me survive more waves, you bet I’m paying attention.</p>

<p>If you fail a run, you’ll still earn some points and a spot on the leaderboard. Points can be hoarded to spend on unlocking new equipment, but you’ll be able to unlock all those tools even quicker if you successfully achieve their per-requisite missions during any run. It’s a really solid combination of parallel goals that always gave me something to focus on in each run. By the time I got comfortable with one combination of equipment and one stage, I was already ready to tackle another stage, or try out some new equipment, or both. I was kept on a consistent and constantly engaging pattern of unlocks through all five stages of the game, and I couldn’t get enough of it.</p>
<p><em>Kill Knight </em>is just a blast. Runs are quick, hectic, and satisfying even in defeat. It’s a lot to learn at first, but the second I overcame that learning curve I couldn’t put the game down until I saw it through to the end.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware has <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-115?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-PatchNotes115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Elden Ring patch today, updating the game to version 1.15. This is a small patch, but it contains a number of performance improvements and several bug fixes, as listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the cutscene that plays when entering the Shadow Keep Church District would play again when re-entering the area.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some of the Golem Fist weapon attacks would not deal damage when the player was affected by certain special effects.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Golem Fist weapon one-handed heavy attack power was lower than expected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Aspects of the Crucible: Thorns incantation from being cast when used in quick succession.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Smithing Talisman effect did not apply to some weapons’ throwing attacks.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the use of ashes in some areas of the Scadutree Avatar battle arena.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rellana, Twin Moon Knight would sometimes perform unexpected actions when interacting with objects in the battle area.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed Skills to be used in incorrect combinations with Weapons under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused unexpected rendering and behavior of some enemies under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some sound effects did not play correctly.</li>
<li>Several performance improvements and other bug fixes.</li>
<li>Further fixes were added to the game’s end credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The changelog of the Elden Ring patch also includes some tips on improving performance in case you're experiencing issues. According to the developers, the PlayStation 5 version of the game might improve frame rate stability by using the Rebuild Database option from the console's safe mode. PC players should check whether ray tracing has been automatically enabled; if so, they can disable it. Third-party apps that handle mouse behavior may also negatively impact the performance of Elden Ring. Lastly, FromSoftware says that the message 'inappropriate activity detected' may appear even mistakenly. In that case, PC users should verify the integrity of the files.</p>
<p>Elden Ring won't get any more expansions after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, but the studio will likely update it with minor patches for a while.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> developers Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unspecified number of workers, as part of what they call a "internal reorganization and reprioritization". The layoffs would ultimately benefit Smite 2, claimed the company's boss, who added that the cuts "disproportionally affect" those working on cosmetic skins and game "system features", as well as people in marketing and publishing roles.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we’re making difficult but necessary changes to ensure Hi-Rez's long-term success, with a specific focus on positioning Smite 2 for a long and sustainable future," said CEO Stewart Chisham in <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382">a Xitter post</a> yesterday. </p>
<p>"This move follows a comprehensive review of our strategy and operations. In the game division, we have decided to concentrate our efforts entirely on Smite 2, outside of small teams supporting light updates for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and Smite 1.</p>
<p>"While these changes are difficult, we believe they are necessary and we will emerge stronger from them."</p>
<p>The executive called the measures a "heartbreaking decision" reflecting "a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability." It's not clear whether he means the act of "reprioritization" has affected himself somehow, or whether these are simply the usual words of empty sympathy from management often spoken in such times. </p>
<p>Hi-Rez also had a round of layoffs last year, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/layoffs-expected-as-hi-rez-studios-restructures">30 people losing their jobs</a> as part of a larger restructuring that saw the company's uberstructure split into several different chunks, all overseen by a new corporate entity known as Hi-Rez Ventures. </p>
<p> As for the studio's focus shifting heavily towards Smite 2, that's sort of expected, and likely would have happened whether or not people lost their jobs. The game itself is grand enough, as MOBAs go, at least according to Matt Cox when he wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">Smite 2 early access review</a>. Although he did mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> as an obvious and superior competitor, calling it "Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane". </p>
<p>The layoffs, meanwhile, happen amid a wider trend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">"restructuring"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalizing"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">"aligning"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">"sunsetting"</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">"integrating"</a>.

<p>Krafton has singed an agreement with Palworld developers Pockerpair to bring Palworld to mobile.</p>



<p>The announcement comes from a <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton Press Release</a>, which reveals that the company has signed a licensing agreement for the intellectual property (IP) of ‘Palworld.’</p>



<p>The announcement reads that, “Through this contract, Krafton will expand the Palworld IP to the mobile platform. It plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment. The project will be handled by the development team of ‘PUBG STUDIOS,’ a creative studio under Krafton.”</p>



<p><span>Palworld’s release on PC and Xbox attracted 25 million players and reached the third-</span>highest number of concurrent users on Steam of all time. The game made its debut on the PlayStation 5 in September.</p>



<p>Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo will be pursuing legal action over Palworld</a> for patent infringement, to which Pocketpair replied that, “we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.”</p>



<p><span>Despite its success, the game received some community backlash upon its release due to its&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-palworld-really-plagiarize-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming similarities to Pokemon.</a>&nbsp;Many fans of </span>Pokemon compared the images and assets online accusing Pocketpair of plagiarism and the conversation around the issue has seemingly never been squashed. </p>

			<p>Ryujinx, the sole remaining Nintendo Switch emulator for PC after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure of Yuzu</a>, has also been taken down by Nintendo. The news came a few hours ago from one of the main collaborators on the open source project, which was the first emulator to boot commercial Switch games.</p>
<p>Here's the Discord message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Yesterday, gdkchan (the author) was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of. While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure. These words are my own. I don't want to speak for anyone else here, so just remember that while reading.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you to everyone who has contributed code, documentation, or issue reports to the project. Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special. I'm extending my own massive thanks to our moderation team, who have been here through some rough circumstances and always found ways to make light of it.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Ryujinx can no longer be downloaded via GitHub or the official website, where the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download page</a> is now entirely blank. It may have taken them years, but Nintendo finally decided to completely crack down on the Switch emulator and pirate scenes.</p>
<p>Recently, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit against Palworld, alleging that Pocketpair infringed multiple patents with their game. Whereas with the emulators, the companies likely had no choice but to fold even merely due to lack of funds for the legal expenses, the same appears unlikely with Palworld, which is one of the best-selling games released in 2024 so far.</p>

His tail, arms, and legs are posable, so you can display Bowser in a variety of different poses. In addition to articulated joints, Bowser's jaw snaps and buttons beneath it turn his head. He can also shoot fireballs to (try to) stop Mario from thwarting his plans once again. When on his stand, Bowser is flanked on each side by fiery towers.</p><p>There's also a hidden POW Block, which was implemented specifically for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Playset-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2G23D8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Princess-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2CNDYZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach</a> figures to step on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-details-video-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a video dubbed an exclusive report, one creator and reporter has broken down a series of claimed details about Project Tatanka – later known as Project Ekhert – the famed and failed Halo battle royale title. It was claimed that Tatanka (or Ekhert) was cancelled in 2023 because of a desire to focus on the next main Halo game and because the battle royale genre was wavering.</p>



<p>Read on to check out the full array of claims about the cancelled Halo battle royale project.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Many fans were excited about the prospect of a Halo battle royale title, including some prolific streamers with a penchant for first-person shooters. Unfortunately, all signs point to 343 Industries having cancelled the project, capping it to work on bigger and better things for the series. </p>



<p>In January, it was claimed that 343 Industries was heading in an entirely different way for the next Halo title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-unreal-engine/">‘starting from scratch’</a> and utilising a new engine. Shortly after, Project Tatanka (Project Ekhert) was shut down, as the claim goes.</p>



<p>In a post on social media that accompanied an ‘exclusive’ YouTube report, creator ‘Rebs Gaming’, who has spotted key Halo-related details in the past, listed a bunch of details tied to the cancelled Halo battle royale game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Tatanka: Halo Infinite’s Canceled Battle Royale Mode (Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEUh_vS4b5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>He stressed it was being playtested ‘weekly’ by 343 Industries, which is where many of these details came from. Players would drop into a map on the Zeta Halo ring made up of multiple fragments, and they’d get there through an ODST-style drop-pod system. As players explored the map, they’d pick up power items, equipment, and shields, all while completing ‘mini objectives’.</p>



<p>As the game unravelled, Pelicans would fly over and drop off vehicles — Warthogs, Mongooses, Falcons, and the like.</p>



<p>These details are yet to be corroborated, but whether they’re accurate or not, the fact remains — there is no Halo battle royale game on the horizon and it was once heavily rumoured that one would materialise. In the absence of such a game, some savvy creators have started piecing together their own Halo battle royale mode, which shows how there’s an appetite for the game.</p>



<p>Do you think a Halo battle royale would have done something to save the series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-rene-leaks-reveal-%E2%80%98disappointing%E2%80%99-mobile-gaming-mechanics.998259/</guid>

<p>In recent days, new shots from a test build of Project Rene have allegedly leaked online, showcasing several changes that have left The Sims community disappointed. At first blush, it appears that Electronic Arts has changed the conceptual style revealed so many months ago and pivoted to a more mobile-friendly design complete with ‘grindy’ tasks and microtransactions.</p>



<p>On September 17, the team revealed that there were no plans to release The Sims 5, and instead, it would keep pushing updates into The Sims 4, the decade-old title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-mobile">Going Mobile</h2>



<p>Project Rene has been in development for the longest time, and the team at Electronic Arts hasn’t exactly been forthcoming with updates. From leaks concerning an open-world map to a developer diary that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-5-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposed some prototype art</a> for the game, details have been drip-fed into the community over the last few years.</p>



<p>In the last few days, some leaked images have surfaced online revealing what’s claimed to be a more updated test build of Project Rene. These images have caused fans to lash out against the developers for creating what appears to be a typical and rather generic mobile game:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i can’t believe my eyes that Project Rene has switched its course from being a promising successor of the Sims 4 to some ugly ass mobile game that will be another cash grab full of ads <a href="https://t.co/55zBbi4vJI">pic.twitter.com/55zBbi4vJI</a></p>— tom (@simshive) <a href="https://twitter.com/simshive/status/1840433234867359749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>What’s ironic is that in January 2024, it was revealed that The Sims Mobile would receive no further updates. It’s almost written in stone that Project Rene will be a replacement of sorts for the mobile title that was online for so many years, but some fans aren’t happy with that revelation.</p>



<p>In the leaked screenshots, we see a microtransaction tab powered by ‘Simoleons’ and some examples of quests that users will grind to earn XP and in-game currency. It’s assumed that they’ll use that currency to unlock clothing, furniture, and other items, making this as typical a mobile game as you could ever hope to play.</p>



<p>In addition to these images, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post surfaced on Reddit</a> from a user taking part in an ongoing playtest. They explained that it’s a game based on a ‘collaborative multiplayer experience’ that’ll see players form relationships with other, real players. </p>



<p>Are you concerned that Project Rene is headed in the wrong direction? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Japan Has a Playtime Plan To Foil PS5 Pro Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps-japan-plan-ps5-pro-scalpers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-japan-has-a-playtime-plan-to-foil-ps5-pro-scalpers.998244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps-japan-plan-ps5-pro-scalpers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Almost as soon as the PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition was unveiled, scalpers set to spoil legitimate consumers’ fun by selling their pre-orders online for thousands of dollars. In some territories, pre-orders for this sumptuous Sony console sold out in minutes, many of which were claimed by malicious scalpers.</p>



<p>PlayStation Japan isn’t taking that sitting down, though. If you want to pre-order a PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition over there, you’ll need to meet some critical criteria.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beat-back-the-scalpers">Beat Back the Scalpers</h2>



<p>Whenever something desirable is revealed in the gaming world, scalpers rush to power up their bots and join queues on every platform possible to secure pre-orders. They’ll then turn those pre-orders – or outright purchases – into money-making machines on platforms like eBay, charging two, three, or four times the price and trapping desperate, legitimate users.</p>



<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/to-battle-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-edition-scalpers-sony-imposes-conditions-for-ordering-the-console-but-only-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton recently spotted</a> that the PlayStation Japan team has implemented a few base requirements for users looking to pre-order the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to have a PSN account <strong>registered in Japan</strong>, and that account will need to have at least 30 hours of playtime recorded on any PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 game <strong>between </strong>February 2014 and September 2024. </p>



<p>It’s a minor blocker, but it should be enough to prevent many of the run-of-the-mill scalpers with absolutely no interest in what they’re buying. It means that pre-orders for the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition in Japan are more likely to be reserved for legitimate gamers interested in securing the console <strong>because they’re fans</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s almost moot now, given how rapidly the PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary Edition sold out worldwide, but it’s good to see that at least one region is aware of the threat presented by scalpers.</p>



<p>Did you manage to secure a pre-order for this gorgeous console? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is adding two more classic games to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service next week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-gp-legend/" data-ref-id="5000-19983">F-Zero: GP Legend</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-climax/" data-ref-id="5000-21316">F-Zero Climax</a> will both join the Game Boy Advance library on October 11.</p><p>Originally released in 2003 and 2004, respectively, GP Legend and Climax are the final two F-Zero games released for the Game Boy Advance. In addition to the standard Grand Prix and Time Attack modes, GP Legend boasts a story mode and an extensive roster of racers.</p><p>F-Zero Climax, meanwhile, has previously never been localized, making this the first time it will officially be available outside of Japan. It features a course editor and is notable for being the final new installment in the series. Following its release, the F-Zero series remained dormant for more than 19 years until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-99/" data-ref-id="5000-603158">F-Zero 99</a> arrived in 2023.</p><p>As mentioned, both games will be available through Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan, a premium tier that grants subscribers additional benefits, including access to classic Nintendo 64 games and select DLC expansions for some Switch titles. An individual membership costs $50 USD a year, while a family plan costs $80 USD and covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts.</p><p>That's not the only news for F-Zero fans. The aforementioned F-Zero 99 is also receiving a free 1.5 update, which introduces a new Grand Prix league, five additional tracks, and new machine decals. F-Zero 99 is free to download for all Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>

In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><p>For more discounts on games, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals today</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

The <strong>Lego Super Mario Piranha Plant is discounted to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $48 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F71426%2F2651673420%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-super-mario-piranha-plant-drops-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6526845%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a></strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ryjinx-is-gone-emulation-switch-nintendo-unreasonable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the Switch emulator Yuzu <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went down due to legal pressure by Nintendo</a> in March, I saw countless tortured arguments online trying to rationalize it. One was that Tropic Haze had not been smart about how they had gone about development, and many people pointed to competing Switch emulator Ryujinx as a model example. But today it was announced via Discord that the developer of Ryujinx had been contacted by Nintendo, reaching an agreement to stop working on the project and take the assets down from Github. The <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo for Ryujinx</a> is now offline. Ryujinx is no more, at least in its current form, but what did anyone expect? Nintendo was never going to stop with Yuzu, and I doubt this will be the last time they do this.</p><figure><figcaption><span>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of,” user rip in peri peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in the Ryujinx Discord server. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p><p>“Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project,” they continued. “Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special”</p><p>In addition to that, rip in peii peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188894357745700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> several in the additions to the emulator that were not public: a remarkably stable version of the emulator that ran on iOS that unfortunately would remain a novelty due to UI limitations, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2KuTFZ-efQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WIP android version of the emulator</a>, improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVre_0ZVUg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metal support</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a>. Developers Ac_K and Berry also chimed in, expressing their gratitude for the community and the project.</p><p>Though I am quite curious what the exact nature of the deal between gdkchan and Nintendo was, the practical reality is it does not matter. Ryujinx was the main Switch emulator that was not an active fork of Yuzu. Since Nintendo reached its settlement with Tropic Haze, other emulators have forked Yuzu’s code and continued development, Suyu and Sudachi being the primary ones. (3Ds emulator Citra has also found a stable fork.)&nbsp; But the process has not been smooth sailing: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24108191/gitlab-suyu-nintendo-switch-emulator-takedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab removed Suyu</a>, citing a DMCA claim. Discord nuked the accounts of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127545/discord-suyu-sudachi-server-shutdown-account-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suyu and Sudachi</a> developers, also citing a DMCA claim.&nbsp; Development can still happen, although Nintendo is making it as difficult as possible to do this above board, in public, without <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/1bkjwsc/suyu_was_dmcad_off_gitlab_now_they_are_self/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-hosting</a>. On top of this, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/retrogamecorps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Retro Gaming Corps </a>claimed they were served a <a href="https://x.com/RetroGameCorps/status/1840077263598915978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMCA takedown from Nintendo</a> this week for showing off Wii U.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</figcaption></figure><p>I understand why Nintendo is doing this, in the same way I understand a boa constrictor strangling a small animal to death. It is within Nintendo’s nature and character to act this way, to throw its weight around and to make open source development difficult, particularly as the Switch’s successor creeps into view.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that emulation itself is not criminal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there is precedent for this</a> and it is telling that most of the time they have settled out of court. Another reality is that the games Nintendo was releasing on its ancient hardware have run like shit for years; just ask anyone playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhHFABnLfVg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> (I am, it does). These are not the actions of a compassionate or reasonable company; this is throwing your weight around because you can. Year after year they somehow manage to find the most maximally suspect way to go about these things. <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-nintendo-lawyer-sue-pocketpair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I should not find myself siding with <em>Palworld</em></a>, and yet here we are!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Brilliant, But What About Performance?

If only there was a way to play it on better hardware.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We have been living in a golden age of emulation, from the MiSTer to countless other projects. But Nintendo has not only shown itself to constantly be a bad steward of its history, but also a viciously litigious one. If emulation is driven underground again because of moves like this, it will be categorically bad for the history of gaming. We cannot return to living that way, because there is too much at stake.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bungie's efforts to build enthusiasm for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">fan concerns</a> continue with yet more teases for next year's Codename: Apollo expansion - which is now confirmed to be whisking players to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination", as seen in new concept art, and arriving alongside "next generation" armour.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">announced Codename: Apollo back in September</a> as part of "major changes" that'll see the studio launch two "medium" Destiny 2 expansions every year, instead of a single major release. At the time, Apollo was described as a "non-linear character-driven adventure", with the word "Metroidvania" floated but not confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKgp_Ivy4ds">latest developer stream</a>, Bungie has shared a little more detail on what's to come. Codename: Apollo, as previously confirmed, arrives next summer as the first of Bungie's twice-yearly "medium-sized" releases, which, for context, are said to be approximately the same size as Destiny 1's Rise of Iron expansion.
</p>

<p>
Each will have its own unique campaign and post-game content that players can "dive really deep into" beyond the initial experience - Apollo kicking off Destiny 2's new Frontiers saga with a journey to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" featuring a "non-linear campaign that puts [players] in the drivers seat of exploring its world and its story".
</p>
<p>
Bungie says players will have freedom to explore multiple destinations from the off, with some areas only becoming accessible once a specific item has been found elsewhere. Along the way, there'll be characters to meet and choices to make, with Apollo set to feature between 25 and 30 "different threads" of stories players can tease out as they complete different activities - the idea being to keep them in the world and always exploring.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The studio remains evasive when it comes to specifics, but concept art (above) for the new expansion shows "people [players] haven't met yet" in Destiny, and inspirations for Apollo are said to range from early 60s prog rock like King Crimson and Jefferson Airplane, to Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five and the TV show Scavengers Reign.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Bungie ultimately has in store, it's being described as an "exotic world" that's "tailor-built around the joy of discovery", where players will acquire powerful abilities to uncover secrets and carve a path to the great mystery at the heart of the planet.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Also coming next year as part of efforts to revitalise Destiny 2 is a system Bungie is calling "next generation armour". This, it explains in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/next_gen_armor">lengthy blog post</a>, is intended to make armour "exciting again" by giving it unique properties and more manageable stats. Essentially, this will mean a "smaller number of unique stats on any piece of armour, with larger contributions to these stats, and every stat point providing a benefit." There's a lot more detail in Bungie's post, though, so it's worth checking out the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Before all that, however, Destiny 2 is poised to embark on its latest season, Revenant: Act 1, which gets underway next week. Top of its additions is the new Onslaught: Salvation mode, featuring three maps (Widow's Court was demoed during the livestream), new enemies, and new defensive abilities. There's a turret, for instance, plus improved Stasis Slow tripwires, and an airstrike that sends a devastating blast from above when enemies stray into its radius. Expect all that (and more!) when Revenant begins on 8th October.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5.998106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Unreal Fest opener has concluded, and it was used as a large celebration of the developer and creator ecosystem that has been utilized by those who can access the Unreal Engine and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). The Fest was used to show off many new features surrounding Epic Games, but most importantly, some of the new features coming to Unreal Engine 5 in the Unreal Engine 5.5 update.</p>
<p>During the opening session, a huge announcement was made, saying there are now new Unreal Engine royalty rate savings when shipping eligible titles on the Epic Games Store before or on the same time as on other platforms. Developers can now reduce the royalty they must pay Epic from 5% to 3.5%. This is due to the terms of the standard Unreal Engine EULA saying that those who ship a game are generally obligated to pay Epic 5% of worldwide gross revenue.</p>
<p>However, effective January 1, 2025, the royalty rate will decrease from 5% to 3.5% for earnings above $1 million. Again, this pertains to the royalty fee when the Unreal Engine game is published in other stores, like Steam; Epic already completely waived the fee for UE games shipping on its own store. The&nbsp;<span>terms and conditions of the 'Launch Everywhere with Epic' scheme are nuanced, and for those who plan to do that, it's worth<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/release" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> looking into</a> exactly what this means for them</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, Unreal Engine 5.5 Preview 1 has been released for those interested in the developer tool. During the opening session of Epic Games Unreal Fest, guests got to see the new technology that they have been working on within Unreal Engine 5. This includes a live demonstration of a new experimental feature in the software called MegaLights. This enables those using the software to create movable, dynamic, and realistic area shadows with the ability to light volumetric fog. The demonstration was shown in real time running on PlayStation 5, where a scene navigated an area with over 1,000 shadow-casting lights.</p>
<p><iframe title="MegaLights Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_p5AvHA9h8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>UE 5.5 also includes new rendering improvements, with Nanite now able to render Skeletal Meshes much faster and Path Tracer being Production-Ready. This feature has already been used in major movies, including Piece by Piece, the Unreal Engine animated biography of Pharrell Williams.</p>
<p>Plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/catch-up-on-the-big-news-from-unreal-fest-seattle-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more updates</a> to Unreal Engine 5 were discussed at Epic Games Unreal Fest, as well as their efforts to ensure that&nbsp;high-end games on mobile are supported with the utilization of UE 5.5.</p>
<p>Additionally announced was the Fab Publishing Portal, which will unify the Unreal Engine Marketplace, Sketchfab Store, ArtStation Marketplace, and Quixel.com, allowing developers to shop and sell assets all in one place on an 88/12 revenue. The portal initially opened on September 17 but will be fully operational in mid-October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-zombie-games-to-play-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Millions of gamers worldwide <strong>love </strong>a good zombie game. They represent some of the best examples of freedom, violence, and survival out of any gaming genre, and despite being <strong>morbid</strong>, there’s something so compelling about an end-of-the-world story. To answer the demand for these titles, we’ve assembled a list of the best zombie games to play in 2024.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hungering for a solid zombie-focused adventure, or to explore a dank, unforgiving wasteland, look no further than this guide. We’ve taken the 10 best zombie games you can play right now across a mix of platforms, so you don’t need to look far to fulfil that desire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-zombie-games-you-can-play-right-now">Best Zombie Games You Can Play Right Now</h2>



<p>This is a mix of games across different genres and platforms and with varying price points. It’s a fine collection, and every one of these games is certainly worthy of being on our list of the best zombie games, but if you’ve got a different recommendation, feel free to leave it in the comments – we might add it!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dying-light-and-dying-light-2">1. Dying Light (And Dying Light 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light is one of the greatest open-world zombie games ever made, emerging in 2015 as a fast-paced, high-octane slasher from Techland. It boasted remarkable parkour mechanics and some of the best zombie combat we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dying-light-2-had-so-much-cut-content"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-cut-content/">Dying Light 2 Had So Much Cut Content</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-2-state-of-decay-and-state-of-decay-2">2. State of Decay (And State of Decay 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The State of Decay games are exclusive to Xbox and PC, and they’re fantastic representations of the people management needed to survive in a tense zombie apocalypse. In State of Decay, players must build a community, manage a base of operations, and scavenge for resources.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-project-zomboid">3. Project Zomboid</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Project Zomboid is a punishing title and probably the hardest zombie game on this list. It’s one of the best zombie games out there because it’s so granular, and despite the lack of flashy graphics, Project Zomboid will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering where the next attack will come from.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-dead-island-and-dead-island-2">4. Dead Island (And Dead Island 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Island is a strange franchise – there was a ten-year gap between Dead Island and Dead Island 2, but when that gap had reached its end, one of the best zombie games ever was delivered. Dead Island 2 is a monumental slayer of a title that will have you engaged for hours.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dead-island-2-hit-1-million-sales-in-three-days"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">Dead Island 2 Hit 1 Million Sales in Three Days</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-5-left-4-dead-and-left-4-dead-2">5. Left 4 Dead (And Left 4 Dead 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was Valve’s stab at a zombie apocalypse title – and what a successful one it was. This four-player bullet-spraying epic took survivors through a series of stages bursting at the seams with zombies – and some well-crafted mutated zombies, too. </p>







<h3 id="h-6-the-last-of-us-and-the-last-of-us-part-2">6. The Last of Us (And The Last of Us Part 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically they’re not <strong>zombies</strong>, but the infected in The Last of Us give off those undead vibes for sure. In 2013, The Last of Us was released on PlayStation 3 and it quickly became regarded as one of the best games of all time – and it’s certainly one of the best zombie games to make this list.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-zombies-any-of-them">7. Call of Duty Zombies (Any of Them)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>COD Zombies is a legendary side mode that has been present in more than half a dozen Call of Duty games over the years. It is a staple for Treyarch’s creations, and over the years, it has gone from a simple wave-based survival mode to a full, open-world adventure.</p>







<h3 id="h-8-dead-rising-1-4">8. Dead Rising (1 – 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is one of the most iconic zombie franchises in gaming, and since the first game was released way back in 2006, it has worked to establish itself as a founding father of all modern zombie games. It typically features a race against a clock, crowds of thousands of zombies, and extreme ingenuity when it comes to crafting weapons.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-days-gone">9. Days Gone</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Days Gone was a one-shot PlayStation exclusive that featured a zombie-slaying bounty hunter on a bike, Deacon St. John. It was an open-world epic that boasted an engine capable of producing swarms of zombies that numbered in the hundreds, and it never failed to terrify players who weren’t expecting the masses to charge at them.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series">10. The Walking Dead (The Telltale Series)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Walking Dead hasn’t had a great track record in gaming – except for when it comes to the Telltale series. This collection of games – which are episodic by nature – offers up a phenomenal experience in The Walking Dead’s universe, bringing a choice and consequence model to the table in some of the best zombie games we’ve ever seen. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Far Cry Games, Ranked Worst to Best]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-far-cry-games-ranked-worst-to-best.998094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Far Cry is one of the most beloved franchises with origins that stretch back almost twenty years. It’s a legendary series that allows players to experience ambitious adventures fraught with danger, high-octane gunfights, and gorgeous vistas. In this list, we’re diving deep into the series, assembling a breakdown of all Far Cry games ranked from worst to best.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever found yourself wondering what Far Cry game is best, look no further than this list. It’s every Far Cry game ranked by genuine fans of the iconic Ubisoft series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-far-cry-games-ranked">All Far Cry Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>This list is a mix of rankings sourced from Metacritic and the opinions of a long-time Far Cry fan. It’s the best of both worlds and ultimately, ranking a series is a subjective thing. It’s possible you won’t agree with the ordering – but if that’s the case, then leave a comment highlighting your ordering for all the Far Cry games!</p>



<h3 id="h-8-far-cry-6">8. Far Cry 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The latest game in the series of Far Cry games also felt like the weakest one ever released. It was ambitious and innovative enough in place, and it looked nice on the surface, but it had no staying power and was quickly abandoned. It’s the lowest-rated game in the series according to Metacritic. Sadly, even the remarkable talents of Giancarlo Esposito couldn’t save it.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-far-cry-new-dawn">7. Far Cry: New Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically a spin-off, New Dawn followed Far Cry 5 as a standalone expansion, offering up the only post-apocalyptic environment we’ve ever seen in the Far Cry series. It looked beautiful, but it didn’t play very well, and there were too many bizarre story elements to enjoy the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-far-cry-5">6. Far Cry 5</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 5 was a relatively well-received game, but it’s the second-worst-rated title in the series according to Metacritic, and personally, I found it to be a very buggy game. It was one of my favourite settings for a Far Cry title, but aside from a huge twist at the end of the game, it felt all too predictable and laborious to play properly.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-far-cry-primal">5. Far Cry: Primal</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Again, Primal is technically a spin-off, but bizarrely, it was one of the most innovative titles ever released out of all Far Cry games. It boasted a prehistoric setting, with players being plunged into the Stone Age – and for this game, Ubisoft literally crafted an entire language and series of cultures and tribes. It was a refreshing change, but the gameplay loop quickly became repetitive.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-far-cry-2">4. Far Cry 2 </h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 2 was the first game in the series developed by Ubisoft, expanding on the first game’s success some four years after it was released. It was a hyper-realistic game when it was released and boasted one of the largest sandbox maps at the time, and the game’s multiplayer platform was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-far-cry-4">3. Far Cry 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 4 featured one of the best casts in the series thus far – and one of the most iconic villains. In its setting in the Himalayas, Far Cry 4 produced some of the most stunning vistas in the series, and while it wasn’t too far advanced over its predecessor, it made for a fantastic playing experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-far-cry">2. Far Cry</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crytek produced Far Cry, making it the first game to be developed using the CryEngine, which makes it historic by default. It was released way back in 2004 and kickstarted the series in earnest, and even today, it’s still the second-highest-rated game in the series, according to Metacritic. It was more stealth-focused than later games, and the praise it received on launch was widespread.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-far-cry-3">1. Far Cry 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 3 is widely considered to be the best out of all Far Cry games, boasting a fantastic open world, solid writing, and some of the most memorable characters in gaming history. For instance, Vaas, the game’s big baddie, is still praised today – and his actor has gone on to star in some notable productions both in and out of gaming. </p>



<p>In Far Cry 3, players were introduced to some innovative features and mechanics, and the world felt like a joy to explore. It didn’t feel like much of a grind, and combat was extremely satisfying. It had enough length to really become immersed without feeling too repetitive – except for those damn towers. </p>



<p>That’s why, out of all Far Cry games, Far Cry 3 takes the top spot.</p>

He says he’ll be offloading some of his responsibilities with the rest of the team at developer ArtPlay now that he has begun his cancer battle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/shutaro-ida-1727815508484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shutaro Ida (blue shirt) with Koji Igarashi (hat). Image source: Castlevania Wiki.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I, SHUTARO, also known as Curry Boy and Curry Sage, have been diagnosed with cancer and have begun my battle with the disease. I have already started talking about the sequel to Bloodstained, and have ideas for the game and such. From now on, the responsibility [for game direction] will be shared. Thank you for your support," Ida wrote in a post translated by X and verified by IGN.</p><p>Ida has been instrumental in the Bloodstained universe and had planned on continuing it with a sequel. Bloodstained 2 was originally<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-2-sequel"> <u>announced back in 2021</u></a>, though no additional details about its progress have arrived since then. At the time, publisher 505 Games touted the action RPG as a success that managed to reach “generally favorable” reviews from both critics and fans on<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Metacritic</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">これまで、DSシリーズやブラッドステインドは実質的にSHUTAROディレクターを中心に制作を行ってきました。<br>正に彼の作品と言えるでしょう。<br>そんな彼がプロジェクトから遠ざかるのは大変な痛手ですが、それに負けぬよう頑張ります。<br>また一緒に仕事ができるまで回復することを期待します。 <a href="https://t.co/YirZi5fYYD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/YirZi5fYYD</a></p>— IGA (@KojiIGA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiIGA/status/1841046423493886146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Longtime Castlevania producer and ArtPlay president Koji Igarashi<a href="https://x.com/KojiIGA/status/1841046423493886146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>re-posted Iida’s remarks</u></a>. While acknowledging Iida’s contributions to the series and gaming as a whole, he assures fans that the rest of the team will push through until Ida is able to work with them again.</p><p>“Up until now, the DS [Castlevania] series and Bloodstained have essentially been produced primarily by Director SHUTARO. It can truly be called his work. It is a great blow to have him step away from the project, but we will do our best not to be defeated by it. I hope that you will recover quickly enough to work with us again.”</p><p>Ida led the charge on Bloodstained and made a game that we ranked as<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-metroidvanias"> <u>the fourth best Metroidvania of all-time</u></a>. In our<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/25/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review"> <u>8.8/10 review</u></a>, we said, “The wait was worth it. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a whole new castle to crash full of unexpected monsters and mysteries in the vein of classic Castlevania.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>You’ll find a lot of cool arcade cabinets in the Arcade1Up catalog, many of which feature tough-as-nails retro games. But on November 5, Arcade1Up's lineup expands with the most challenging classic game of all, the claw machine. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up's Full-Size Claw Machine</a></strong> is available to preorder now for $500 at Amazon. Though it may sound pricey--it's the same price as many traditional Arcade1Up machines that offer a bunch of preloaded game--at least you won't waste any quarters playing this claw machine. Plus, if you want a standing claw machine for your game room, it'd be difficult to find one this low of a price, as they are still largely sold as commercial products.</p><div title="6526823 - Arcade1Up Claw Machine Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2697" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526823 - Arcade1Up Claw Machine Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Arcade1Up Full-Size Claw Machine</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$500</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>It features a light-up marquee and button, adjustable sound volume, and includes 12 plastic capsules for you to fill with goodies. Of course, you can also throw stuffed animals and other items into the playing arena without any issue--making it a pretty cool activity for a birthday party or family get-together.</p><p>Arguably the coolest thing about this claw machine is it has adjustable difficulty settings: easy, medium, and scam, otherwise known as the default mode in the machines at your local Walmart.</p><p>This also opens the door for an innovative spin on taking toys away from your kids when they are misbehaving. Your son won't stop attempting yo-yo tricks near the priceless family heirlooms? Toss the yo-yo in the machine, crank the difficulty up to scam mode, and tell him he can have it back when he wins it. Honestly, this "punishment" might be a bit too fun.</p><p>If you're wondering what "full-size" means here, the machine weighs 80 pounds and has dimensions of 22.5 x 22 x 61.25 inches. If you have one of Arcade1Up's other machines with a riser (or a deluxe model), that's what you can expect from this claw machine. Standing at just over five feet and a width and depth of close to two feet, the claw machine definitely isn't as big as the machines in grocery stores that you badgered your parents about playing. That said, the fact a standing height claw machine for $500 exists at all is notable.</p><p>Despite the ubiquity of claw machines in arcades and retail shops, the vast majority of home claw machines are tiny tabletop models. You can find a bunch of those on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=claw+machine&amp;crid=2CNK2RW41A5F5&amp;sprefix=claw+machine%2Caps%2C106&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, but you won't find a full-size model for kids and adults at a major retailer. Claw machines are typically sold by specialty retailers to businesses for significantly higher prices, often in the thousands. The current claw machine market is pretty similar to the arcade machine landscape before Arcade1Up popularized budget-priced cabinets for home use.</p></div>                      </div><p>A handful of other Arcade1Up machines are on sale right now at Amazon, including the versatile <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-1Up-Screen-Infinity-Game-Table/dp/B09B1FNZJJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Infinity Game Table</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo may have just won its battle to put the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators out of business. In March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">it sued Yuzu out of existence</a> — and now it may have convinced Yuzu’s primary competitor, Ryujinx, to go away too.</p><p><a href="https://ryujinx.org/download">Ryujinx’s download page</a> is now empty. <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/">Its GitHub</a> is gone. And the emulator’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">X social media page</a> and official Discord now contains a possible explanation: Nintendo got to its lead developer, and convinced them to shut down the project for good.</p><p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” writes developer and moderator ripinperiperi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/410208534861447168/410222607581839365/1290743991310221495">on Discord</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is.”</p><p>The rest of ripinperiperi’s message is a eulogy for the project, including a pair of videos showing the Ryujinx team’s progress on iOS and Android ports of the Nintendo Switch emulator, among other core changes — ones that will now presumably never ship. </p><p>Nintendo would not confirm or deny to <em>The Verge</em> that it made a deal with the developer. Instead, Nintendo spokesperson Eddie Garcia mysteriously pointed me to the Entertainment Software Association’s head of public affairs Aubrey Quinn — who said she couldn’t speak on behalf of Nintendo. I guess I got the runaround. </p><p>Compared to Yuzu, Ryujinx was thought to be relatively untouchable. Rumor had it that lead developer GDKChan was based in emulation-friendly Brazil, though I never found proof of that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">when reporting on the plight of the emulator world</a> earlier this year. Certainly, we never heard about a lawsuit against Ryujinx, nor did Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127545/discord-suyu-sudachi-server-shutdown-account-ban">go after its Discord server</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147936/nintendo-dmca-takedown-yuzu-emulator-copies">DMCA its GitHub</a> as we saw with other Switch emulators. (GitHub does currently not show a DMCA takedown request for Ryujinx, by the way.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Ryujinx’s now-empty download page.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ryujinx</cite></p></div><p>While emulators are technically legal in a broad sense, there’s nothing preventing Nintendo from filing lawsuits that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath#:~:text=no%20developer%20has%20the%20money%20to%20fuck%20around%20and%20find%20out.">indie developers cannot afford to fight</a>, filing DMCA takedown requests, or simply putting pressure on organizations like Discord and GitHub to pull things down themselves. </p><p>There are even legal theories that suggest Nintendo <em>could </em>win a case if it went to court — not because emulators are illegal, but because of the other copy protection mechanisms in the Switch and the argument that some of these modern emulators are trafficking in piracy.  </p><p>While Nintendo often leaves emulators alone, Ryujinx did recently show up Nintendo by running <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">the just-released <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> on PCs smoother than it runs on the Nintendo Switch itself, where framerate can sometimes be choppy. </p><p>It also seems like Nintendo may be back on the legal beat in general: this weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1frjcaa/hey_everyone_this_is_russ_from_retro_game_corps_i/">popular YouTuber RetroGameCorps announced</a> that Nintendo has filed enough copyright strikes — just for showing Nintendo games like <em>Zelda Wind Waker HD</em> running on various hardware in his videos — that his entire YouTube channel is at risk of deletion. As a result, he says he won’t show Nintendo games anymore.</p><p>While it seems likely that this is the end of the official Ryujinx team, several members of whom are saying goodbye in its Discord, it’s possible it’s not quite over. Sometimes, a coup can wrest control of a distributed developer group like this; we haven’t heard from GDKChan yet. It’s also possible that, like with Yuzu, forks of Ryujinx will spread across GitHub and across the web at large, or that their code will become the basis of future emulators. </p><div><p>As <a href="https://suyu.dev/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> points out, Yuzu offshoot <a href="https://suyu.dev/">Suyu is still available</a>, on its own self-hosted servers.</p></div><div><p>You can read <a href="https://boilingsteam.com/an-interview-with-gdkchan-creator-of-ryujinx/">a rare interview with GDKChan</a> at <em>Boiling Steam.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular open source Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx has been <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx">removed from GitHub</a>, and the team behind it has reportedly ceased development of the project after apparent discussions with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Ryujinx developer <a href="https://github.com/riperiperi">riperiperi</a> writes on the project's Discord server <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">and social media</a> that fellow developer gdkchan was "contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of." While the final outcome of that negotiation is not yet public, riperiperi reports that "the organization has been removed" (presumably from GitHub) and thus "I think it's safe to say what the outcome is."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">the Ryujinx website is still up</a> as of this writing, the download page and other links to GitHub-hosted information from that website no longer function. The developers behind the project have not posted a regular progress report update <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-january-2024/">since January</a> after posting similar updates <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/">almost every month throughout 2023</a>. Before today, the Ryujinx social media account last posted an announcement <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1763916049647382644">in March</a>.</p>
<p>Followers of the Switch emulation scene may remember that March was also when the makers of the Yuzu emulator <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">paid $2.4 million to settle a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> over a project that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/how-strong-is-nintendos-legal-case-against-switch-emulator-yuzu/">Nintendo alleged</a> was "facilitating piracy at a colossal scale."
</p><h2>What is left?</h2>
<p>Switch emulator Suyu, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/heres-how-the-makers-of-the-suyu-switch-emulator-plan-to-avoid-getting-sued/">emerged as a "legal gray area" Yuzu fork</a> shortly after that Suyu takedown—is <a href="https://suyu.dev/">still available on its own self-hosted servers</a> as of this writing (though the project's <a href="https://git.suyu.dev/suyu/suyu/releases/tag/v0.0.3">last stable release</a> is now six months old). Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-suyu-hit-by-gitlab-dmca-project-lives-on-through-self-hosting/">previously targeted Suyu's GitLab hosting</a> through a DMCA takedown and later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/nintendo-targets-switch-emulation-chat-servers-decryption-tools-with-dmca/">took down the project's official Discord server</a> with a similar request. Another prominent Yuzu fork, Sudachi, was <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2024/07/09/sudachi-repo-received-a-dmca-request-from-nintendo/">removed from GitHub in July</a> via DMCA request.
</p><p>In the wake of those legal efforts against other Switch emulator developers, the Ryujinx developers posted an automated message on their Discord server in response to any questions about Ryujinx's ultimate fate. "Nothing is happening to Ryujinx," the message read. "We know nothing more than you do. No dooming."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nz6k7wURlPo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video of an in-development Ryujinx feature allowing local wired multiplayer between an emulator and official hardware.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Riperiperi reports that development will now stop on "a working Android port" of the emulator, which was not yet ready for release, as well as a tech demo iOS version that would likely have remained a "novelty" due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">Apple's just-in-time compilation restrictions</a>. Developers were also working on updates that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo">would have allowed local wired multiplayer gameplay connections between Ryujinx and real Switch hardware</a>.
</p><p>"While I won't be remaining in the switch scene either, I still believe in emulation as a whole, and hope that other developers aren't dissuaded by this," riperiperi writes on the project's Discord. "The future of game preservation does depend on individuals, and maybe one day it'll be properly recognized."</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929032104/https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx?tab=readme-ov-file">According to the developers</a>, "as of May 2024, Ryujinx [had] been tested on approximately 4,300 titles; over 4,100 boot[ed] past menus and into gameplay, with roughly 3,550 of those being considered playable."</p>

His answer was blunt but honest: “I don’t. I literally don’t.”</p><p>Englund went on to explain that he’s “too old” to be Freddy Krueger again in a live-action sequel. However, he did say he was open to doing a “gimmick” cameo of some kind and suggested a role he could play in a theoretical remake of <em>Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors.</em><br></p><p>“I would love to be invited if they reboot Part 3, <em>Dream Warriors</em>, which I think is the most popular film of the franchise,” Englund told <em>Bloody Disgusting. </em></p><p>“It would be fun to play one of the doctors. The great Priscilla Pointer, Amy Irving’s mother, was in that film. Maybe I could play her part as a male doctor that’s very cynical. A cameo wink to the audience that I don’t buy that there’s this dream demon that everybody’s having the same dream about. It’s in the tradition of remakes, especially with horror, to give an actor that’s been in the original a little cameo, so I think that would be fun.”<br></p><p>He also suggested that he could return to voice Freddy in a “high-end animated version” of <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, saying it would be “nice” to be asked to do that. However, he reiterated that he’s just too old to do play Freddy in a live-action movie again. </p><p>“I know I can’t do the fight scenes [for] more than one take now, one angle,” said Englund. “I just can’t be snapping my head or anything like that. I’m an old dog! Give me a break!” <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The message, which you can read below, was also posted on Ryujinx's X/Twitter account. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2Ggt9SWoDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Ggt9SWoDI</a></p>— Ryujinx (@RyujinxEmu) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It also came just hours after some users raised concerns, noticing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ryujinx/comments/1fts9z6/rest_in_peace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryujinx's Github page</a> currently leads to a 404 message. Others pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ryujinx/comments/1ftrt07/download_page_shows_nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryujinx's download page</a> also wasn't loading, sparking more concern for the emulation project. Amid the speculation, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ryujinx/comments/1ftufnd/last_word_from_the_discord_an_announcement_will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the Discord's mods assured</a> fans that an announcement was coming, asking them to not spread misinformation in the meantime. </p><p>As it says on its <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Ryujinx is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator written in C# for Windows, Linux and macOS. It began as a single-developer project in 2017, collecting a small team of developers along the way. </p><p>Today's news is only the latest in Nintendo's ongoing crackdown on emulators following its lawsuit against Tropic Haze, creators of the popular Switch emulator Yuzu. Tropic Haze <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze">paid $2.4 million in damages</a> in the settlement, and Yuzu was shut down entirely. Nintendo claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated 1 million times</a> before its release in the lawsuit, and<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-takedown-request-targets-over-8500-copies-of-switch-emulator-yuzu"> issued a takedown notice</a> for more than 8,500 copies of code of Yuzu in May. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
