<p>Larian says that it isn’t necessary to play the older Divinity games before starting the upcoming game. </p>



<p>The Baldur’s Gate 3 developers have been in the news a couple of times lately, most recently for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments on AI</a> and the reveal of the new Divinity title at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. Since then, we have heard some new details about the upcoming title, and now the developers have revealed that we don’t need to prep by playing previous games in the series. </p>



<h2 id="h-players-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-only-for-the-lore">Players Should Play the Older Divinity Games Only for the Lore</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Larain founder Swen Vincke elaborated on playing the older Divinity: Original Sin games. Vincke first spoke about how the upcoming title will reference events from the original games, including Ego Draconis, the same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, and more. However, these events are now “just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>



<p>Vincke adds that players who tried Baldur’s Gate 3 for the cinematic experience shouldn’t try older Divinity games unless they “want to know the lore”. If the player likes “tactical combat, or co-op multiplayer, or really having lots of freedom,” then they should definitely try out Original Sin 2, as that title served as a blueprint for Baldur’s Gate 3. Vincke concluded, stating that players who want to know everything, “there are games that came before, but they’re a bit outdated by now, they are quite old.”</p>



<p>In other news, Divinity will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as previous Larian games. Additionally, the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn-based and co-op gameplay</a>. Will you be playing the older Divinity or jump directly into the new one?

Two characters, who a few days earlier learned something particularly shocking--one of several moments in the game that recontextualizes the whole experience--get up early and end up watching the sun rise together. It's a little moment of tranquility, of two people bonding over natural beauty amid a particularly rough string of days, and it landed beautifully. It felt like the game was tapping into something a little deeper, a little more melancholic, than what I'd seen before.</p><p>According to online estimates of the game's total length, at the point I saw this scene, I had another 90-120 hours to go until I could really say that I'd "finished" the game, depending on my speed and patience. The name The Hundred Line refers to the number of days the students of Last Defense Academy have to defend their school for as waves of invaders periodically force them into tactical combat. But the name actually has another meaning that you uncover once those 100 days pass for the first time, about 30 hours into the game: This game has 100 unlockable endings, and to get the full picture, you'll want to see all of them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The promise of 100 endings feels like the sort of marketing mistruth that pops up in a press release to play up how much the game is shaped by your choices. A game that claims to have 12 endings might actually mean four endings, each with a few minor potential variations. And yes, some of the endings in The Hundred Line are kind of cheating, or are very similar to each other--not every ending is created equal. But there really are 100 of them, consisting of 21 different "routes" that can all end at various different points.</p><p dir="ltr">At the point that these two characters took in the sunrise, I had seen eight endings; I was still a good five hours from getting my ninth (although endings 10-12 were all unlocked within an hour after that). Seeking out these endings had revealed new information about the game world: The paths leading to those endings had shown characters in a new light, and several of them had poked at new corners of this game world or revealed new lore. They'd been silly, sad, a little scary, and alternately funny and tragic. Different characters died each time, and the emotions I felt over each one were different. As I wrapped up the pathway that, I believe, is the closest thing the game has to a "canon" ending, I knew that I'd keep going, and that knowing everything I'd learned on my way to that ending would only deepen my understanding and appreciation of the many paths I still had to take.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is co-directed by Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi, best known, respectively, for the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games: two series known for their huge twists, hyperactive narratives, and penchant for killing off cast members. This new game has all of that too, and it throws in a pretty competent Fire Emblem-style combat system on top. That's not to mention the bonding stats with each individual student, the board-game-like "exploration" mode, or the RPG-style character stats and loadouts you can gradually tweak as the game progresses.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, in games that promise a story shaped by the choices you've made, a major appeal is the notion of getting to the end and experiencing the conclusion of the story that you have co-authored with the game's writers and designers, finding the conclusion that represents the pathway you forged through the experience. Maybe you'll play again and make different choices to experience some different scenes; more likely you'll simply take it as a given that if you <em>did</em>, the story would be a little different next time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line takes a different approach: It's a choose-your-own adventure story, but instead of needing to keep one finger back on the page where you made your last choice in case it doesn't pan out, you have a neat timeline that lets you revisit every single choice in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The most empowering thing about this game is that your own choices don't really matter, because the best way to play the game is to make all of them and see every outcome. There are certainly some pathways that give you more information or a deeper story, endings that feel "good" or "bad" or some shade between, but there's no sense of punishment, or of being denied certain story beats because of your choices.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a rare, exciting feeling that I don't experience often with games of this scale: the sense that the developers were able to pursue their exact vision through to the end. The Hundred Line is the kind of game that no business strategist or market expert would advise a company to make and release in 2025. A game this huge, with no additional monetization, with a pointed focus on storytelling, with a $60 price tag and a lot of strange and challenging themes: It could be a potential recipe for disaster, especially when it relies on 3D models for its tactical combat system and numerous cutscenes. It's a game that many media and influencers are going to be a little scared to touch, too, since it's so lengthy and text-heavy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Hundred Line took over five years to develop, and the script--which must contain something in the ballpark of one million words--would have made localization extraordinarily expensive, especially when you factor in voice acting. In a pre-release interview with </span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/if-the-game-does-not-sell-well-we-may-be-done-its-do-or-die-for-too-kyo-games-and-the-hundred-line">Nintendo Life</a><span>, Kodaka admitted that if the game did not sell well, the studio "may be done" after taking out loans to fund development. A week after the game came out, in response to a fan on Bluesky, Kokoda </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loa6no5b2c2j" rel="nofollow ">stated</a><span> that the company was "still on the brink of going under."</span></p><p dir="ltr">And yet, The Hundred Line has been a success. By July, three months after launch, the game was selling well enough that Kodaka told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, "I don't see bankruptcy as a serious future." Exact sales figures have not been released, but it seems that the risk Too Kyo Games took in spending so much time and effort on developing this behemoth paid off.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of it, I think, is that Kodaka and Uchikoshi have built up good will with their previous series: the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series amassed global fanbases over a long period. The Hundred Line is also audacious in a way that is undeniable and uncommon: the sheer size of the thing is exciting, more so than a game that offered, say, 30 different endings. It also helps that the tactical battles are quite enjoyable, with just enough depth and originality so that going into battle never feels tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond all of that, though, the storytelling in The Hundred Line is--to boil down an immense quantity of work into a simplistic sentiment--very good, with excellent character dialogue, fantastic voice acting, and a great many "what if" scenarios you can explore. The characters are all interesting, developing and deepening over time, and seeing how they change and adapt to the vastly different stories you can explore is fascinating--it's impressive to see the game maintain consistency across different paths.</p><p dir="ltr">As reports continue to come in of developers tightening their belts as the industry shifts towards more conservative, proven tactics to turn a profit, seeing a company taking a huge risk to make something both enormous and unusual, and having it pay off, is heartening. Even without that context, though, The Hundred Line would still be my favorite game of 2025. It's a breathtaking achievement in narrative design, a truly wild example of just how much you can do with player choice, and one of the most ambitious visual novels ever made.</p>

<p>While the games that are released bring the joy of being able to experience something new, there’s something about the build up to a game that can be just as, if not more, exciting as the release itself. In 2026, the gaming calendar is loading with titles like Marvel’s Wolverine, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero that could be in contention for Game of the Year. However, no game has the community talking and is more anticipated than Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).</p>



<p>A poll hosted exclusively on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> saw GTA 6 get 29.8% of the votes. That may be far less than the 87% it received last year, but that can be blamed, if you will, on the other games in development.</p>







<p>But why did GTA 6 win for the second year in a row? It’s kind of obvious, really. </p>



<p>It’s the first game in 13 years for the nearly 30-year-old franchise. It also sees the series return to Vice City and the state of Leonida as a whole in what looks, based on the information released so far, to be the largest region in the history of GTA. </p>



<p>Two trailers have been released so far, both doing well over 100 million views, showing just how excited players are to get this game. It’s expected to be the highest-grossing game in the series and could very well beat the sales numbers for GTA 5, which made $815 million in just 24 hours. </p>











<p>As mentioned, GTA 6 received 29.8% of the votes this year. Where things got interesting, though, is in the rankings that followed.</p>



<p>Second place saw a tie between a game confirmed for next year and one still a year or two away. Both Marvel’s Wolverine, which releases next fall, and The Witcher 4 received 18.2% of the vote. That was followed by another tie for fourth between Resident Evil Requiem and the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake at 9.9%.</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes included 007 First Light, Phantom Blade Zero, Pokémon Pokopia, Saros, and Fable.</p>



<p>What do you think about GTA 6 being voted the most anticipated game of 2026? Is it something you agree with or are you more excited for a different game.

<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in February. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s no question that Nintendo makes some of the best video games in the world thanks to its incredibly skilled and passionate in-house and partner developers. But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?</p>
<p>Last year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist <strong>Takaya Imamura</strong>, famous for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, Captain Falcon and the many machines in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora’s Mask</a> itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different. So, naturally, we said 'Yes!' and flew thousands of miles to sit down with the man himself.</p>
<p>Imamura-san is now coming back to gaming with his new project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">OMEGA 6: The Triangle Stars</a>, an adventure inspired by his own manga. In this interview, we speak about the upcoming game, his days working on games like Zelda, and why he left Nintendo after all those years...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Omega 6 looks a lot like a long-lost Super Famicom game. How long have you had the idea for this game in your head?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takaya Imamura:</strong> So it’s actually pretty new as a concept. It’s derived from the manga. The idea wasn’t there from the beginning. I wrote the manga, then the chance to create a game based on it came up.</p>

<p><strong>In that regard, what do you love about working outside of Nintendo and how is developing a game different now for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now I enjoy it. I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Did we hear correctly that you’re a professor as well? How do you juggle all of that?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, as a professor I’m teaching students, they come to class at a certain time, there’s summer holidays and I know when I need to work and when I don’t. Like Indiana Jones. [makes whip-cracking sound]</p>
<p><strong>Are you a big Indiana Jones fan?</strong></p>
<p>Yea, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to play <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">The Great Circle</a> when that comes out?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh, of course!</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like being a teacher and a famous game developer? Do you have students that know of and are fans of your work?</strong></p>
<p>There are some like that, but the majority don’t really know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Wow! That’s so interesting! I feel if you were a teacher in the US or the UK people would react differently to you being their teacher.</strong></p>
<p>Even students who really look up to me tend to hold back during class. It’s when we go out for a meal or drinks then they ask if I’ll sign or draw something!</p>
<p><strong>It’s nice that there’s a time and place for that sort of thing. To get back to Omega 6, what was your biggest inspiration for the art direction?</strong></p>
<p>Once I left Nintendo, I was thinking, 'How can I do something on my own as a creative?' The easiest and first thing that came to mind was to make a comic since I can draw. I really wasn’t thinking of how I could sell the comic and make money, I just really wanted to draw this comic. If I can put it digitally on Kindle and a few people buy it? Great!</p>
<p><strong>The game itself has a massive roster of characters, and I love how there’s a list of them all that you can flip through. Are you sharing design duties with anyone else or are they all created by you?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you! Basically it was all me except there are four characters in there that my students designed. I did the pixel art for those few characters but my students came up with the original designs.</p>

<p><strong>That’s amazing! You directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/steel_diver">Steel Diver</a> and have worked on plenty of other games with Nintendo over your many years there, but when’s the last time you’ve gotten to express yourself in this way?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the first time I’ve been this free, because there’s nobody to tell me 'No', or to tell me when to stop. I just do what I want as much as I want.</p>
<p>When I was at Nintendo, or when you’re doing something in a professional environment and the project has milestones that people have to check off, you get senior people like the producers and managers that say, “Alright, you need to reel this one in,” or, “Let's not do this.” Ya know, I really never liked that. I think for pretty much anybody who is a professional game developer, this is something they’ll go through. Of course, you know, when you’re at a company, the company has to make money!</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember what it was that made you want to leave Nintendo? You’d been there for many years, but it’s a dream for many to work there.</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually pretty simple. I quit when I was 65. This is the same for anybody, but life is short. We’ve only got a number of years on this earth and there’s a limit to the amount of things you can do with that time. I was kind of mulling over that and at the same time I got an invitation from the university to come and teach and I thought, 'Whoa, this is an opportunity to change things.'</p>
<p><strong>This was three or four years ago, right?</strong></p>
<p>I left in 2021!</p>

<p><strong>What are a few things you miss working at Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p>For the first six months or so after leaving Nintendo, I kept dreaming I was still going to work. I’d start developing a game and then I’d wake up and go, “Oh, oh. Okay that’s weird.”</p>
<p>I actually met with Shigeru Miyamoto once after I left and I said, “Hey, long time no see!” But I actually didn’t feel like that was true since I was seeing him in my dreams all the time. He got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p><strong>You were at Nintendo for such a long time, so were you pretty close with a lot of your colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I still keep in contact with all of them. For example, the director of Animal Crossing, Aya Kyogoku, is coming out to see me teach in the classroom in October.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, really?! Is she going to be speaking or just sitting in to observe?</strong></p>
<p>She’s just coming over for a chat! If I have her give a lecture or something like that, then she’s gotta ask Nintendo and it has to be approved.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel for you to be able to pass on all the things you’ve learned to a newer generation?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very difficult because if I was to host a speech, lots of people would come and listen, I think. When we turn it into a formal lecture, then there’s people who are like, “Ughhh, I don’t wanna be here.” People sleep in class, so it’s like any lecture in school.</p>

<p><strong>So I know you’re very famous for creating Tingle - was there anything specific that really inspired you to make him?</strong></p>
<p>The background and the lore of the character was decided beforehand and I was only responsible for the visuals. Basically, I found a guy on the team and drew a caricature and there was Tingle!</p>
<p><strong>That seems to be a running theme for you, taking members of your team and putting them in the game! You did this with Star Fox, Falco and Slippy too, yeah?</strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty good at caricatures. With Star Fox, it wasn’t a direct caricature but instead I was taking inspiration from different people. But yeah, that is one of the ways I do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="652e38f36eafb"><a title="Star Wolf characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/652e38f36eafb/star-wolf-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you’re saying there’s a real-life Tingle roaming around in the world?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>We know there were a lot of character designs that were carried over from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to Majora’s Mask but did you design any other characters in that game?</strong></p>
<p>The only real NPC I made was Tingle, but I designed the Moon and Majora’s Mask and that was kind of iconic. I was the art director, so I wasn’t designing the actual characters, more setting the overall theme and direction for the art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember why you were tasked with designing Tingle then? Did someone on the team want you to do it?</strong></p>
<p>It was just a coincidence really. Everyone else was busy so someone asked me, “Hey, could you do this one?” and I said, "Sure!"</p>
<p><strong>Majora’s Mask was developed in a very short amount of time, which sounds like it could be really stressful, but when you think back to that time making that game, is there anything that stands out? A funny moment, maybe the way you bonded with a coworker, or a way you made yourself proud?</strong></p>
<p>It was a really short project compared to general Nintendo timelines, so everybody was really focused on getting it done. So there really wasn’t much room for fun, games, and hijinks. But, near the end of development, I had a homepage at the time and I was drawing caricatures on it just for fun and a TV company got in contact. There’s a program in Japan where they get people on and they compete by drawing caricatures and they’re judged and everything, and I got invited to go on that!</p>
<p>And I thought, 'Huh, okay!' It’s a pretty famous program in Japan, so I thought I’d ask Nintendo and they said, “Yeah, go ahead, why not!” Nintendo said okay, but I was planning to go on without making a big deal about the fact I worked for Nintendo. Then I heard the date the program was going to go live, and it was the release date for Majora’s Mask in Japan!</p>
<p>So I thought, 'Well, in that case, I’ll go on and say who I was!' Then the program ended up coming down to the studio and filmed us developing the game a little bit, and there was me at my desk drawing some pictures. It was such a happy coincidence.</p>

<p><strong>Do you know if that is available online to watch?</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t been able to find it actually.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really?! I would personally do so much to see that!</strong></p>
<p>The program was called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Champion">TV Champion</a></strong>. *<em>picks up phone and starts looking*</em> It’s a knockout competition and I made it through to the final!</p>
<p>By the way, are you a fan of Tingle?</p>
<p><strong>*shrugs and shakes head*</strong></p>
<p>[Laughs] I know there was a fan campaign to get rid of Tingle at one point, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars!</p>
<p><strong>I was quite young when the game came out, I think I played it when I was eight. I remember wanting to be Link when I was a kid, so when I saw Tingle, I was like, “Oooo, who is this guy?” He doesn’t fit in the suit, flying around on balloons, letting out a funny scream when you shoot him down. I’ve grown to love him now, but as a kid I always wanted to be the 'cool guy.'</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley is officially available, with a shadowdrop landing today, December 25th. It’s priced at just $14.99, but existing owners can take advantage of a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>It boasts several innovations to boost the game up to spec on Nintendo’s latest flagship console, including ‘intuitive mouse controls’ and online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.</p>







<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-on-switch-but-2">Stardew Valley on Switch, But 2</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe has delivered everyone a neat Christmas gift and launched Stardew Valley’s Switch 2 edition without any warning. It’s available to download <strong>now </strong>through the Nintendo eShop, but if you already own Stardew Valley on the Switch, you can download a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>This new version of the game introduces mouse controls, four-player split-screen co-operative multiplayer, and, as mentioned, eight-player online support. If you lean on GameShare, four friends can play together even if only <strong>one of them </strong>has the game.</p>



<p>While we knew about the version upgrade for Stardew Valley thanks to an announcement made months ago, a release date was never confirmed. It was given a <strong>window </strong>of Fall 2025, which it missed. Here’s the trailer that was published to announce the upgrade several months back:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Back in July, Stardew Valley shattered a record held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years on Steam</strong>. It became the highest-rated game on the entire platform, out of tens of thousands of games. That’s nothing if not indicative of how universally beloved Stardew Valley is.</p>

<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-rpg-game-of-2025-nominations">Best RPG Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors. Its battle-to-battle scenarios and set-pieces are determined by your team and your build: How you invest skill points, your ability to attack an enemy’s weakness, and so forth. It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>



<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>

You can also admonish us for not giving it to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!</p>

Her journey to defeat Moebius's massive Engineers, which hold the Cores she desperately needs to save the city, will take you through derelict factories, deserts, mining facilities, and into myriad arenas for some of the best first-person gunplay of 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metal Eden wears its Doom Eternal inspiration on its sleeve, turning wave-based arenas into coliseums of destruction, lest you stop moving. Using her jetpack, turbo boosts, ammo, armor, and health pickups scattered around the arena, you'll need to hold your breath and shoot everything in the room – it all wants to kill you, after all. Pause for a second, and it could spell certain doom. The resulting combat experience is a fast-paced, kinetic, on-the-go shooting gallery that I promise will send adrenaline surging through your veins.&nbsp;</p><p>That high-speed gunplay elasticity carries over into the Ghostrunner-like runs in between arenas, which task you with keeping momentum as you sprint on walls, grapple up to platforms, and jetpack double jump to safety, all while shooting down enemies that threaten your existence. The reward at the end of a linear run through Moebius' various locales is one of the aforementioned arenas, the perfect zones to try out your latest weapon upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>There's more to Metal Eden, like some Metroid Prime-inspired sections and a voice-in-your-comms that's a bit too present, but ultimately, everything that happens when you aren't pulling the trigger gets in the way. Fortunately, these sections aren't as frequent as the parts of Metal Eden that shine, so rest assured, there's an excellent shootout just minutes away when things feel slow.&nbsp;</p><p>For more of my thoughts, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metal-eden/shooting-through-the-noise">read my Metal Eden review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/25/why-you-should-play-metal-eden]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161278/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stray Children launched on the Japanese eShop on 26th December 2024. We weren't able to review it back in October when it arrived in the West, but we've now managed to catch up with Onion Games' latest...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Your dad’s missing and some weird “uncle” is at the door, claiming to know you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a> just chucks you straight into things with barely a title screen – but perhaps that sort of stylistic confidence is unsurprising coming from people behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. Yoshihiro Kimura and Onion Games have delivered a compact, auteur-driven project, heading off on adventures into emotional storytelling rather than into sophisticated mechanics. And it uncovers some impressive treasures on its quest.</p>
<p>The story we’re told is that of a dog-faced kid venturing into a fantasy world through the screen of a video game. That world is surreal, funny, and sometimes very dark. In contrast to this unsettling tone, the graphics present charming, cute pixels, with a colour palette stirring memories of the Game Boy Advance. That soft presentation is the lens to show rather strange and uncomfortable things: <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong> orphans in a prison, for example, or a stalking frog paparazzo.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161281/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game takes its unexplained opening and runs with it, shunning straightforward exposition and trading instead on feelings and vague impressions. Nonetheless, the gist of it is that you are trapped in a trippy, sinister world populated by children who are abandoned and lost.</p>
<p>It is the world of a video game, and its heroic knight has been destroyed – your task is to put it back together. The children, meanwhile, are lacking clear figures of authority, yet subject to judgement, labelled “bad” and punished. You explore from a top-down perspective in the 16-bit style, talking to myriad inhabitants of this endlessly off-kilter world.</p>
<p>The themes of parental authority and a child’s perspective are taken further by the enemies in the lands you explore. You will face random encounters with the “Olders” – creatures based on adults, themselves failing to cope with hang-ups and demons. They inflict suffering and strict expectations while wrestling their own internal frustrations.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161286/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In practice, this is represented by bullet-hell-style attacks dealt out in a turn-based structure. Kimura was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is no bad thing. The Olders can be defeated by attacking on your turn, which requires you to stop a spinning arrow on a segment of a circle. The size of the segment, its position, and the number of rotations you’re allowed before you have to press all get changed up. However, it’s not exactly the deepest mechanic – that’s just not what the game’s going for.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting, the Olders can instead be talked down from their fixations and freed, excluding them from further random encounters. This talking mechanic is a continuation of the inscrutable approach Onion Games has taken to the game. Various speech options need to be selected in the right order during combat, taking one turn per option, and resetting when mistakes are made.</p>
<p>Finding out the right order for your statements, however, is mysterious in the extreme. It’s very easy to miss out completely on freeing the Olders, and even the ones you get will still require some guesswork. Later, tougher bosses make trial and error pretty severe, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161277/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That experience of talking to the Olders is emblematic of the game’s general attitude to you as you play. There is plenty of friction here, but it’s so consistent from minute one that it’s clearly intentional. Experiencing the world as something confusing and unexplained — inexplicable perhaps — is alienating but childlike. This hammers home what the game’s about, but it doesn’t always feel good to engage with. There’s a tension between delivering on the theme and being fun to play, but that just makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>One thing that consistently delights, however, is the sound. The music sits perfectly with the game’s surreal world and its colours, which seem at once washed out and oversaturated. Eerie woodwinds, for example, make the perfect theme tune for tailing pigs along a train track, something like 2000s J-pop accompanies a lily pad gliding minigame, and a trilling harpsichord leads you around a grand palace.</p>
<p>The stand-out feature of the sound effects, meanwhile, has to be the character voices. These sit somewhere between the apparent sentences of Simlish and the one-dimensional jibber-jabber of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a>. They are clearly somehow composed from different languages, with some distinctly German snowmen being particularly memorable.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161280/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite some frustrating repetition (unskippable dialogue right between a save point and a boss fight? Check!), Stray Children is not overlong, clocking in at about 12-15 hours. A lot of my time was spent wandering, searching for hidden items in every nook and cranny, and talking to every character I saw – sometimes a requirement for progression.</p>
<p>Again, though, the game gets away with the friction: the disorientation and lack of comfort create a sense of vulnerability – of being a stray. No doubt some players will find this opacity all a bit much. But for those feeling patient and intrigued by the art style and storytelling, it’s a joyful thing to play overall.</p>
<p>While I was in the latter camp — loving the surreal world despite the challenges — I was definitely grateful for the pick-up-and-play nature of the Switch. The pixel art looks great on the small screen, too. The hybrid console is still the best way to play the right kind of games, and this is one of them.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stray Children is nothing if not opinionated. From its abrupt opening to its inscrutable mechanics, it outright refuses to hold your hand. This clarity of purpose builds a world that is totally captivating – <em>if</em> it gets its hooks into you.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time and patience to explore and experiment while being labelled a “bad child”, this may not be for you. However, if you’re game for some surreal challenges, this is a memorable and ultimately optimistic adventure.</p></section>

<p>The holidays have finally kicked in, and players are ready to kick back and relax while trying some new games, warming up with a nice cup of hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this holiday season, you might be thinking of introducing one of your non-gamer friends or family members to the world of gaming. There are some great picks out there where you can experience a whole new world along with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;This Insider Gaming guide will help you pick the best game to play with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games and hardware across all platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-two">It Takes Two</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Starting with the game of the year for 2021, It Takes Two is a brilliant co-op game that will really get your non-gamer friend interested in this field of entertainment. It Takes Two has players exploring a couple’s clashes and how they make up while being turned into dolls and overcoming a series of obstacles. Each level features unique, interconnected abilities that must be used in coordination to get ahead. &nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Split Fiction is the latest title from the same people who introduced us to It Takes Two, but it’s a lot more recent and a great pick for non-gamers. The narrative follows two writers who are stuck in their own stories, trapped by a force trying to steal their creative ideas. One world is sci-fi, and the other is fantasy, and the things you will experience in this game are unlike any other.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-way-out">A Way Out</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Next, we have A Way Out, a premise that should interest a non-gamer friend who’s into prison escape movies. That’s right, in this title, you have to work in tandem with your friend to plan and execute a prison escape. There will be a variety of puzzles and obstacles to overcome through coordination and teamwork across areas that you would only have seen in the movies. Will you be able to break free?&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The latest instalment to the iconic kart racing franchise is Mario Kart World, and it’s exclusively available on the Switch 2. Mario Kart World is a great introductory game for a non-gamer; some competitive fun across various levels is always fun. Moreover, the new entry introduces free exploration, increased 24-player lobbies, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-nbsp">LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>LEGO games are always good titles to get non-gamers inducted into gaming, and Marvel Super Heroes 2 helps if your friend is a fan of the MCU. Players can play as iconic heroes and superheroes from the Marvel universe from different eras and realities as you go head-to-head with the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror. Explore an expansive open world with areas inspired by Ancient Egypt to The Old West, Sakaar, and New York City in 2099, all built in LEGO.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If your non-gamer is not a friend of Marvel, then Star Wars could be their thing. The Skywalker Saga lets you experience all nine films reimagined with LEGO humour and enables you to play the three trilogies in any order you want. There are over 300 characters to play as from this highly popular franchise, more than 100 vehicles, and 23 planets that you can spend time exploring.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another way to get your non-gamer into gaming is to try out some sports titles. FC 26 is one of the most popular sports titles, with football being one of the biggest sports. FC 26 is wildly popular for its co-op play, and players can choose their favourite teams and try out a variety of game modes that suit their preferences.&nbsp;The series has also made some significant improvements over the last title, including more responsive dribbling, smarter AI positioning, sharper, more explosive movement, and much more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If football isn’t your jam, then basketball might be a sport that your non-gamer friend is more inclined towards. The new instalment uses technology that “directly translates NBA footage into realistic gameplay.” NBA 2K26 also features a wide variety of teams and game modes you can choose from, either fight it out in an arena, or take it to the streets. The new title also makes you feel more connected to every dribble and crossover with revamped size-ups and experience fast-paced, dynamic movement with all-new ProPLAY features.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE is an iconic franchise that almost everyone, gamer or non-gamer, has heard of. It’s a familiar, entertaining world where players have spent hours on end performing special moves in real life, and it’s never too late to get into it. There are a variety of modes that players can try out, play with, or against their non-gamer friends, and choose from one of the most prominent entertainment personalities from this world.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Button-mashing is always fun, and what better game for a non-gamer to be introduced to than Mortal Kombat?&nbsp;Mortal Kombat 1 is the rebirth of this universe, where things feel familiar but are drastically altered. Along with a stellar campaign, the game also features a multiplayer mode where you and your non-gamer friend can choose from a roster of characters, each having a unique set of abilities, and battle it out for hours on end. </p>

<p>I suspect many of my fellow parents can relate to this, but when you have your first child, a whole bevvy of problems that never existed before are suddenly thrust upon you.</p>

<p>Granted, a lot of these aren’t necessarily ‘problems’ as such, rather minor inconveniences that, along with frequent moments of unbridled joy, make up the weird and wonderful world of parenthood. I do, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Nintendo, specifically with its approach to game difficulty in the last mainline Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Before having a child, the idea of lowering a game’s difficulty had honestly never really entered my mind. If anything, I would crank the difficulty up wherever I could in the hope that it would both extend my overall playtime and provide a unique sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a> on Legendary? No problem. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> on Climax? Is that all you've got?</p>
<p>This all changed, however, when my daughter expressed interest in playing Mario Wonder. She watched the <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and became somewhat obsessed with the characters – especially Princess Peach. She’s only three, so I knew immediately that if I’m going to let her play, I’d need to make sure it was as approachable as possible, despite my own proclivities.</p>
<p>As you might know, however, Super Mario Bros. Wonder essentially locks its lower difficulty setting to specific characters: Nabbit and four Yoshis. So when the character select screen came up, I gently tried to explain this to my daughter, knowing full well how the conversation would go.</p>
<p><em>“Now listen, if you go for one of <strong>these</strong> characters, the game will be a bit easier for you and you’ll have a lot more fun.”<br></em><em>“I want to be Princess Peach thoooough!”<br></em><em>“That might be a bit trickier. If you go for the purple rabbit, it’ll be better.”<br></em><em>“No, Princess Peach!”</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="d3b1fe9bd18f7"><a title="SSMBW - Nabbit 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3b1fe9bd18f7/ssmbw-nabbit-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"You'll play as Nabbit and you'll LIKE IT!"</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> Anyone who’s had the pleasure of raising a three-year-old knows that it’s borderline impossible to change their mind once their heart is set on something. In this case, Princess Peach is my daughter’s favourite character from the movie, so <em>of course</em> she’s going to want to play as her. This meant we'd have to do without the perks – including <em>invincibility</em> – that come with Yoshi or Nabbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did it go? Well, rather predictably, not well. The opening stage – Welcome to the Flower Kingdom – was doable, but it went rapidly downhill from there. I knew that changing to Yoshi or Nabbit wasn’t suddenly going to make the game a cakewalk; after all, while both characters boast unique abilities that would theoretically make most scenarios easier, there’s still the task of actually navigating the levels. Given my daughter’s age and inexperience, even that would no doubt prove quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Still, it seems baffling to me that Nintendo would create a game aimed at children and families and not offer any optional difficulty settings for the majority of its 12 playable characters. No offence to Nabbit, but no child wants to play him when the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are sitting right there; especially when the Illumination movie had such an immediate, profound influence on my daughter's perception and preferences.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options, in my eyes.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I managed to convince her so she could enjoy the game, but she was exceptionally stubborn in her desire to play as Peach. And honestly? I'm quite proud of that. It makes me think that perhaps, way off in the future, she'll be playing her games on higher difficulties just like me... Or she just loves Peach and wants to play as her – yeah, that's probably it. In the end, though, she gave up and went back to playing with her Peach plushie.</p>
<figure data-uuid="585a5d013f786"><a title="SMBW - Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585a5d013f786/smbw-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah... She never got this far.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> have proven that even the most challenging of experiences can be accessible to almost anybody when it has the right options in place. Quite frankly, I think with invincibility turned on and unlimited stamina applied, my daughter could probably have more fun with Celeste than she did with Mario Wonder – and I consider the latter to be <em>much</em> easier on its default settings.</p>
<p>So come on, sort it out, Nintendo. You've made some strides with difficulty and accessibility options over the years, but you've clearly got a long way to go. Applying blanket difficulty settings to a tentpole Mario title seems like the most basic of tasks when your goal is to reach as many potential players as possible, but as ever, the company stubbornly does things its own way.</p>
<p>Forcing those who want a breezier time to play as a specific character, though..? Nah, that ain't it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 was a solid year</a> for <strong>shooter games</strong> thanks to releases like Helldivers 2, Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and Marvel Rivals, but 2025 can be argued to be even superior now that the calendar is wrapping up.</p>



<p>From medieval melee-infused demon slaying to post-apocalyptic extraction PvPvE mayhem, the shooter landscape has thrived with innovation, technical excellence, and heart-pounding gameplay that demands skill and strategy in equal measure, propelling the genre to new heights.</p>

<h2 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages-8-5">DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>id Software has never been a studio content with resting on laurels, and DOOM: The Dark Ages proves that the legendary franchise still has a lot to offer. The Texas-based studio decided to take players back chronologically, with the events taking place before either 2016's reboot or 2020's DOOM Eternal. Moreover, the setting is vastly changed: the Slayer fights in the techno-medieval world of Argent D'Nur, so the developers reimagined him as a heavily armored warrior. This, in turn, led them to modify the pacing from the relentless, ever-forward-pushing gameplay of Eternal into a slower, more deliberate action experience that relies heavily on the new shield mechanics. </p>



<p>Players can deploy a Shield Saw to parry incoming demon attacks, then either riposte with a melee strike or unleash a charging bash attack to close distances. What makes this system brilliant is that, while inevitably slowing down the combat slightly compared to the previous entry, it remains balanced in a way that forces players to stay in constant motion, thus adhering to the franchise's core formula.</p>



<p>Melee combat also received a complete overhaul with three distinct options: brutal punch combos, a devastating hammer attack, and an armor-shattering flail. All these are genuine tactical choices: ammunition is obtained through successful melee executions, creating a direct link between close-quarters and ranged combat that highlights good decision-making throughout firefights. Finally, DOOM: The Dark Ages features more variety than the series' previous shooter games, thanks to the interspersed mech segments and dragon-riding sequences, which added some perfectly fitting epic setpieces to the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 doesn't just return to the franchise's core identity; it doubles down on the philosophy that made the series legendary in the first place: player-driven destruction and large-scale environmental storytelling. After the mixed reception of Battlefield V and the sheer debacle of Battlefield 2042, Electronic Arts and the teams at Battlefield Studios desperately needed a win. To achieve it, they went back to basics and focused on what fans have always loved about this shooter games franchise. </p>



<p>It could be argued that Battlefield 6 doesn't really include any major innovations, but it didn't need to. The developers just had to bring their A-game to all areas of the game, which they did, starting with the saga's most refined gunplay mechanics to date. Overhauled weapon behavior, revised recoil patterns, and tactile feedback provide a highly satisfying shooting experience that rewards precision without being too hardcore. Every shot, every movement input feels intentional and responsive, especially when played with a DualSense Controller, where Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers elevate immersion (though you might want to turn them off in the settings when playing in truly competitive matches).</p>



<p>The Tactical Destruction system is also back, allowing squads to weaponize their surroundings in ways that directly impact gameplay outcomes. Collapsing a ceiling onto an enemy squad, demolishing cover to create new attacking opportunities, or using vehicle-as-wrecking-ball tactics are all viable choices depending on the situation. Furthermore, the developers demonstrated <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/" target="_blank">that they had learned their lesson from the limitless destruction featured in Battlefield 4's Levolution</a>, as letting players turn entire buildings to dust ultimately harms gameplay; therefore,</span> they removed that option in BF6.</p>



<p>Ultimately, fans vote with their wallets, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's no question that they chose Battlefield 6 this year over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The former, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Alinea Analytics estimates</a>, is the most popular new game released in 2026, having registered over 23.8 million players across all platforms as of November 20.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ARC-Raiders-Keyart-scaled-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">9</a>)</h2>



<p>Whereas Battlefield 6 was by far the most hyped shooter game going into 2025, ARC Raiders didn't really have a similar level of anticipation, especially after the middling reception of the studio's first game release, the arena FPS The Finals. The launch of ARC Raiders was a veritable revelation in the already crowded subgenre of the extraction shooter. Originally, the game was supposed to be a free-to-play co-op (PvE only) shooter. However, Embark decided to change it to a premium PvPvE extraction shooter, even if that meant delaying the game. </p>



<p>This strategy change proved to be extremely effective. First of all, there aren't many third-person extraction shooters in the first place. The main distinction, though, is that ARC Raiders successfully straddles the line between PvP and PvE action, a key balancing act that many games in this subgenre struggle with. Rely too much on PvP, and you lose the cooperative soul that made early extractions appealing; focus too much on PvE, and the game suddenly lacks the unique unpredictability of human behavior.</p>



<p>The game features optional soloing (deliberately harder) but emphasizes 2-3 player squads, where communication is paramount for a team determined to extract with all the loot still in their pockets. The titular ARCs are machine invaders with individual behavioral profiles, weak points that matter, and physics-based destruction that affects their combat capability. Shooting a rotor off a drone causes momentum-dependent spin-outs; removing additional armor sends them careening into environmental hazards or other ARC units. </p>



<p>Like in all the best PvPvE games, the greatest moments in ARC Raiders occur when the two elements suddenly mix, such as when two teams engaged in firefights over loot suddenly face roaming ARC reinforcements. Do they push the engagement and risk mutual destruction, or is it better to coordinate a temporary ceasefire via voice chat against the common machine threat? These dynamic situations are the true reason players keep coming back to it. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders was a smash hit for Embark Studios and Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beating all other games this November on Steam's best-selling chart</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming Google's most searched videogame of the year</a>. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/borderlands-4-14saz.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h2>



<p>After the narrative missteps of Borderlands 3, Gearbox sought to return to its roots with grounded tone, apocalyptic humor, and mechanical depth. </p>



<p>Arguably, the game's most noticeable improvement is the movement overhaul. Traditional double-jumps, dashes, and weapon-swap speed have been replaced with an extensive traversal toolkit: gliding, mid-air hovering, grappling hooks for both exploration and combat, and dodge-rolls for evasion. Each traversal option serves specific tactical purposes: the hover enables mid-air shots while keeping momentum; the grapple accelerates repositioning; the dash provides split-second emergency maneuvers. Ahead of the launch, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described this</a> as the most significant franchise evolution yet. It has never been more fun to move around in Borderlands, that's for damn sure, and the gunplay itself is still as brilliant as ever, ensuring that the new game can be considered among the best shooter games in this area.</p>



<p>The Licensed Parts System elevates the loot loop. Weapons are now composed of manufacturer-agnostic components, so that an assault rifle might sport Maliwan elemental parts, a Torgue magazine, and Hyperion shielding. Rarity directly correlates with component variety, making the hunt for specific part combinations as compelling as chasing rarity. </p>



<p>The four Vault Hunters feature ability sets that meaningfully diverge in playstyles. Vex, the Siren, conjures manifestations to aid in battle; Rafa, the Exo-Soldier, crafts on-the-fly tools like armor-piercing blades. Choosing and specializing the character is, however, only the beginning of build crafting. The existence of several secondary gear systems (Rep Kits offering revives/combat buffs, Ordnances providing cooldown heavy weapons, Enhancements replacing Artifacts) provides plenty of room for loadout variety.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been significantly streamlined. The improved lobby system, crossplay infrastructure, the return of split-screen couch co-op (albeit only on consoles), and instance-based loot (meaning that every player receives their own drops) provided features that the community had long requested. The dynamic difficulty scaling lets friends play together even if their respective characters are at vastly different power levels. Finally, the ability to fast travel to a teammate eliminates the tedious "someone got lost" moments that plagued previous entries.</p>



<p>The main criticism levied at Borderlands 4 at launch was its performance, particularly on the PC platform, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to 'slightly softer' sales</a> than the parent company, Take-Two, would have liked. However, the game has since received several patches <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to improve PC performance</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metal-Eden-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>







<p>By far the smallest game on this shortlist in terms of budget, Metal Eden, the new game from Reikon Games (the studio behind 2017's <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruiner</a>), is a sci-fi FPS that weaponizes mobility, timing, and tactical resource management into something distinctly elegant. As an android named Aska in the artificial city of Moebius, players harvest Cores (consciousness containers) from mechanical enemies, then leverage those Cores for tactical advantage.</p>



<p>Core Ripping is the game's defining mechanic. Players charge their Multitool's Gravity Beam to extract Cores from unarmored enemies. Once extracted, Cores can either be consumed (providing temporary buffs to melee damage, mobility, or survivability) or thrown as explosives. This creates a feedback loop where killing efficiently generates resources that further enhance Aska's combat capability.</p>



<p>Beyond traditional movement, players unlock several traversal options: hovering via jet pack, grapple-rails for acceleration, wall-running, and eventually a "Ball Mode" that transforms Aska into a rolling projectile capable of dealing damage on its own. Combat, which also includes a bullet-time mechanic, is a thrilling experience that is never really frustrating, because enemy behavior is readable; telegraphed attacks provide decision windows for parries, dodges, or counterattacks. The excellent art direction drives Ruiner's aesthetics with neon-soaked environments, distinctive enemy designs, and visual clarity that never sacrifices style for utility.</p>



<p>With its average playthrough runtime of five and a half hours, Metal Eden is shorter than most recent single player shooter games, but it's also available at budget price. Moreover, every level is meaningful, teaching new mechanics or challenging the player's mastery of them. The boss encounters require an understanding of Aska's mobility toolkit and Core resource management, and the pacing is spot-on.</p>



<p>Metal Eden arrived without much fanfare, but it proved that a tight, focused shooter can succeed thanks to design clarity and innovation borne out of constraints.</p>

<h2 id="h-must-play-games-on-the-nintendo-switch-2">Must-Play Games On The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>

<figure><figcaption>Take your Kart across the open world. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to begin than with the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship launch title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-mario-kart-world-be-getting-dlc-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>? In a bold reinvention of the series, Nintendo has thrown open the track boundaries and delivered a sprawling open world filled with secrets, challenges, and a massive selection of new courses to discover as you explore.</p>



<p>The shake-up doesn’t stop there. Mario Kart World introduces a brand-new race mode: Knockout Tour.

Whether you’re racing side-by-side in couch co-op, battling the chaos online, or taking on the AI in solo play, Mario Kart World feels like an instant classic and a must-play for every new Switch 2 owner.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Get searching for those Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Move over, Mario—there’s a new 3D platforming king on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-donkey-kong-bananza-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, from the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, delivers the console’s standout platforming experience. Its lush, interconnected worlds are packed with secrets, clever challenges, and the kind of inventive level design that keeps you exploring long after you finish the story.</p>



<p>DK trades Mario’s finesse for raw power, leaning fully into destruction and chaos. You’ll smash through enemies, tear up the environment, and use DK’s sheer strength to climb, launch, and even rock-surf your way across multi-layered worlds. It’s fast, loud, and endlessly satisfying.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Explore Lumiose City like never before. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t talk Nintendo without bringing up Pokémon, and the series’ newest entry is essential for any Switch 2 owner. Pokémon Legends: Z-A breaks from tradition by setting the entire adventure within Lumiose City, swapping sprawling open regions for a dense, ever-evolving urban landscape filled with vertical exploration and hidden pockets of activity.</p>



<p>The big draw is the long-awaited return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-all-mega-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a>, now more dynamic and impactful than ever. Triggering a Mega form transforms battles into explosive showcases of power and strategy, giving familiar Pokémon a fresh edge. It’s a bold reinvention of the Kalos experience—and one of the standout titles defining the Nintendo Switch 2 era.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Any excuse to revisit Hyrule. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike some of the other games on this list, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom didn’t debut on the Nintendo Switch 2—but its upgrade pack makes it feel right at home. Boosting performance to a smooth 60fps and sharpening visuals to 4K when docked, Link’s latest adventure has never looked or played better.</p>







<p>If you’re new to the Switch-era Zelda games, you’ll want to start with Breath of the Wild to fully appreciate the journey. But if you’re after the most refined and ambitious version of the formula, Tears of the Kingdom is the definitive choice, offering the grandest and most creative Zelda experience available on the Switch 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Somehow even better than the first. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hades 2 isn’t exclusive to the Switch 2, but it feels tailor-made for handheld play. Supergiant’s sequel puts you in the role of Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld, as she sets out to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time. The game builds on everything fans loved about the original—tight combat, stylish world-building, and sharp writing—while giving the series a darker tone and a brand-new mythological focus.</p>



<p>Melinoë’s blend of witchcraft and melee combat keeps every run fast, flexible, and wildly satisfying, especially with new weapons, expanded god Boons, and a deeper cast of characters to interact with. Whether you’re grinding through a late-night run or squeezing in a session on the go, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines on the Switch 2</a> and stands as one of the console’s most satisfying experiences.</p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got a city to burn. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 is no newcomer</a>, but experiencing it on the Nintendo Switch 2 feels like discovering the game all over again. CD Projekt Red’s ambitious RPG has been refined, expanded, and polished since its original launch, and bringing that definitive version to a handheld console is a massive win for players who love deep, story-driven adventures on the go.</p>



<p>Night City’s dense streets, branching quests, and razor-sharp combat translate beautifully to portable play, making every quick session or long commute feel like meaningful progress. Being able to dive into one of the most elite modern RPGs anytime, anywhere turns Cyberpunk 2077 into a must-play addition to your Switch 2 library—and one of the most impressive handheld feats the console has to offer.</p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Later bosses make this guy look tame. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been one of the most anticipated games of the decade, and its arrival on the Nintendo Switch 2 more than justifies the wait. Hornet’s journey through the towering, trap-filled kingdom of Pharloom builds beautifully on the foundations of the original—faster movement, refined combat, and a world so atmospheric and intricate that exploring it becomes completely absorbing.</p>



<p>While it isn’t a Switch 2 exclusive, it feels almost designed for the hardware. The handheld’s responsiveness brings out the best in Silksong’s precision platforming, making every leap, parry, and needle strike feel incredibly smooth. Pharloom’s layered zones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-mask-shard-locations-in-hollow-knight-silksong-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hidden challenges</a> are perfect for quick sessions or long dives, and the sense of discovery never fades. For Metroidvania fans, this is a must-play and a standout addition to the Switch 2 library.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The long-awaited sequel is finally here. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of Metroidvanias, let’s head back to where it all started. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond stands tall as one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship experiences, marking Samus Aran’s long-awaited return to the Prime series. Retro Studios has delivered a bold evolution of the classic formula, blending the atmospheric exploration fans adore with tighter gunplay, richer environmental storytelling, and some of the most visually striking world design the franchise has ever seen.</p>



<p>Though it’s not exclusive to the Switch 2, the upgraded hardware elevates the experience dramatically. The smoother framerate and enhanced fidelity make scanning alien structures, navigating hostile ecosystems, and battling colossal creatures feel incredibly immersive—especially in handheld mode, where the detailed environments and moody lighting truly shine. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-locks-basic-feature-behind-30-amiibo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a triumphant continuation of Samus’ saga and an essential addition to any Switch 2 library.</p>

<h3>"a lot of stick" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Greedy Nintendo! Time and again we hear it, Nintendo are greedy! It is a line that gets repeated so often, I wonder if people actually consider what it means. Shareholders? Nintendo's dividend payments place them just behind Microsoft, as well as many other companies in the gaming sector like Koei Tecmo, Square Enix and Capcom. Executives? In 2024 Shuntaro Furukawa was paid just over a fifth of what Phil Spencer earns at Microsoft. But Nintendo charge too much, especially for older games! Maybe that is true, but they pay their staff quite well and have really high retention rates, they also seem to reinvest what they earn from their popular titles in more niche titles, so maybe the latest release of Super Mario Galaxy will pay fro a new Famicom Detective Club, Another Code or Advance Wars. I also don't think that Gameshare is a feature that screams greed. Nintendo are getting a lot of stick at the moment, and they do make some wrong headed decisions at times, but as far as massive corporations go, they seem ok. We've all gotten used to low prices in gaming, but low prices, high development costs and a fandom that is often reluctant to compromise on quality, is not a recipe for a sustainable industry.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Mcleod</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree that Nintendo, <em>generally</em>, seems to focus on the right things when it comes to experimenting with new ideas, respecting employees, and doing things that other companies wouldn't or couldn't do. That's why we're all here.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything were cheaper, but again, <em>generally</em> Nintendo does a decent job of threading the needle on pricing - although a $50 Kirby amiibo feels like a real ask. Welcome Tour should absolutely have been a pack-in, too, so I get the frustration, especially in this economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I don't think the company needs us defending it from a little childish name-calling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sweaty"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there Nintendo Life!<br>
I wanted to shout out a franchise that I think doesn't get enough credit: Just Dance. I feel like Just Dance is often seen as just that one yearly Ubisoft release that nobody bats an eye at. But this year reestablished for me what a powerhouse it is for social and energetic fun.</p>
<p>This feeling came to me at Comic Con. There was a huge Just Dance setup and it was constantly packed with people. Joining these crowds for the first time was an experience. There's nothing quite like being in cosplay, standing in a crowd of other con-goers and cosplayers, and jumping around to Boney M.'s Rasputin or teaming up with a stranger for Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. No other game there generated the kind of loud and mass fun that Just Dance did, and that's an achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Its appeal is nearly universal. I've enjoyed the game with all kinds of people and in all kinds of places, including in gamer spaces. There's this lovely gaming space I frequent, stacked with consoles and games, so we can play just about anything we want there. Yet a bit ago I booted up Just Dance, and it was a smash hit. We had a blast waving our arms and stepping around the room, with wide grins and loud cries of energetic joy. (Also, shoutout to the accessibility filter and accessible dance routines, so people that can't stand or jump could also join in.)</p>
<p>And speaking of moving around, that's another thing I have to praise Just Dance for. I don't exercise nearly enough: I find it very hard to push myself to do so and I feel deeply uncomfortable and unsafe at gyms. But Just Dance is fun, motivating and accessible enough for me to get up and move with it at least every couple of days. With Just Dance+ there's more than enough songs to keep things fresh, and trying to learn the difficult expert routines to songs like Dua Lipa's Houdini or Britney Spears's Circus and Toxic is genuinely a really fun challenge. I'm not going to act like it's a substitute for proper exercise, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing and I guarantee you that some of these routines will get you sweaty. You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying, I'd love to see it.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Just Dance is a high quality game with lovely visuals, fun and varied choreo's, and appeal everyone including many hardcore gamers. I know it's not for everyone, nothing is, but in so many groups it's been a guaranteed good time for many years, and it deserves more credit for that. Love you Just Dance!<br>
<strong>Zander</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, it suffers from being the known-est of quantities in 2025, but Just Dance is decent and I've had fun with it over the years.</p>
<p>Honestly<em>,</em> "<em>You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying</em>" is prime bonus letter material, Zander. But we're staunch Boney M defenders in this household, and I wouldn't be able to embed this video in the bonus section. Wunderbar. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"throw my hat"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all this talk about animal crossing I've seen a lot of debates about whether new leaf or new horizons is the best. I'd figured I would throw my hat in the ring. I grew up playing new leaf so I have a very strong emotional attachment to that game. I think neither is better than the other. When I play new horizons there are things I wish it had that new leaf, and when I play new leaf there are things I wish it had that new horizons had. For those at the NL towers who have played both what do y'all think?<br>
<strong>beltmenot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wild World was my first, so the impact of anything afterwards is lessened - in my brain, WW is still peak. New Leaf and New Horizons are pretty much on a par. For all the improvements, NH has gotten unwieldy with items accessible in too many different places for my taste, and more to come in the January update. And I'd give anything for an icon that shows if you already own an item on sale in Nook's Cranny!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/poll-so-animal-crossing-new-leaf-or-new-horizons-which-do-you-like-best">We have discussed this before</a>, and most of the team are off on their hols now, but let me see who I can find ransacking the office fridge for party leftovers... <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<li>"NL is way better. Too much crafting in NH, it felt like a chore – NL was honed to near perfection." - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"NL - <em>love</em> NH, but the fiddly island customisation, the more homogenous villager personalities, and the huge focus on decorating gets away from what I adored in NL. NL felt a lot more compact and impactful to me." <em>- Alana</em></li>

<h3>"nothing substantial"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,<br>
been a while since I joined Your community.<br>
last time i wrote a fan letter i was a kid and wrote to power and games, an italian vg magazine, asking for SFII advice on how to beat m. bison at hard level.<br>
no reply.<br>
I'm 43 and I am writing to you now with nothing substantial to say except for congrats on your hard work.<br>
greetings from Genova, Italy.<br>
<strong>Skoffo</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Skoffo! Greetings to you from the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the Bison tips. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"in lieu"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Splatoon fan, and I know there are others hiding around here somewhere, so in lieu of any news whatsoever at all about Splatoon Raiders or an 11.0.0 update for Splatoon 3, I am here with a list of tiny paint-based games to suggest. Or rather, a tiny list of tiny games, because this genre is not huge, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ink">INK</a> - This is legit my favorite platformer! It's got a such a fun gimmick, good difficulty, and is super satisfying to speedrun! I have nothing more to say, just go buy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a> - This is essentially a Mario Party minigame, yes, but it's super fun! If you've got kids, or nieces, or nephews, or other little ones in your life, this is a good time! (Plus it's being updated regularly, so if you ever have suggestions... send 'em in to Hey! Kookaburra and he'll probably implement them.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> - It's on NSO, and like... 67% of you probably have this, so give it a whirl!</p>
<p>OK, thank you for reading my tiny list of tiny games with ink-based aspects. Have a nice day, and stay fresh!<strong><br>
CaleBoi25</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have NSO, I know a man who's got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">a few copies of Mario Paint</a>. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"There could be a Pokémon game collection with Gen 1, 2 and 3 with remakes included." - <strong>Your fan, Scottdevine48</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much greedy Nintendo would charge for that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hello NintendoLife,<br>
Could you please publish PSA articles about NSO game trials? Not everyone is always online and they are easy to miss." - <strong><em>Morsel</em></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a rolling guide might be best. I'll see what we can do. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I got an NSO N64 controller and realised that it can be used to play Mario Kart 8. Do you know what other non-Nintendo Classics games it works with?" - <strong>OswaldTheLuckyGamer</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that doesn't require a second stick? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I just want to say, I love nearly all of you." - <strong>Ed.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

              <p>Looking for a new pair of headphones tha sound great but won’t cost an entire paycheck? You might not believe it, but you can get a pair of Beats Studio Pro headphones for a fantastic price. And they sound great, too.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro are exactly what you’re looking for, and they’re more than affordable. Y<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">ou can get them at Amazon for $179.95, which is a $170.05 (49%) discount from their original price of $349.95</a>. If you ask us, that’s a significant price cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones with booming bass and crisp treble in a slick package</h2>
<p>This model is perfect for anyone looking to be fully immersed in whatever they’re doing (listening to music, podcasts, etc.). Their ear cups are well-cushioned and extremely comfortable, so you can wear them for extended periods of time without them starting to hurt. The adjustable headband lets you customize the headphones’ fit, so you can tighten them or loosen them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro excel when it comes to delivering quality audio, and that’s what you’re here for, right? These headphones are able to produce precise and detailed sound no matter what type of music you like to listen to. The bass is deep and full but doesn’t overpower the midrange and treble. Plus, the vocal clarity is crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Another feature of the Beats Studio Pro is the active noise cancellation that helps eliminate ambient noise so you can focus on your audio without distractions. No matter where you may be (on a crowded train, in a busy office, etc.) the ANC feature can make a serious difference. In addition to blocking out distractions, the Studio Pro headphones also have a feature called “Transparency Mode” that lets you allow outside noises in so you can hear what’s going on even when wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, the Beats Studio Pro can give you several hours of playback time on a single charge. In addition to the battery life, the carrying case of the headphones is capable of getting you back up to speed quickly so you are ready to go again. Fast charging is supported by the headphones so you can obtain a meaningful boost to the battery in a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">All in all, the Beats Studio Pro are a combination of powerful sound, comfort and intelligent features in a product that not only looks great but also performs exceptionally well.</a> And you’re not going to find a better deal for some time, being that we’ve reached the end of the holiday gifting season. That means you should snap yours up while you still can.</p>

              <p>I feel like a broken record, but once again, in many ways this was a bad year for developers, gamers, and the industry writ large. But hey, just because AI slop is ruining everything and greedy execs are destroying pop culture, that doesn’t mean we can’t find some joy and genuinely great moments in all the bullshit.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-surprises-games-trailers-video-game-moments-2024-1851725768">Like we’ve</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">done in years past</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-news-announcements-surprises-2022-1849899925">here</a> we’ve collected 10 of the best video game surprises and bits of good news from the past year. Hold on to them tightly. Cherish them. Reread this list a few times. Remember that things can be good. Hope is important. We’ll likely need a lot of it to get through 2026.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> Rules</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001641" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001641"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001641">©FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The average person seems pretty burnt out on live-service multiplayer games. Fans had every reason to respond with groans and sighs to the idea of the premier action-RPG maker turning its attention and resources to exactly that<!--StartFragment --><span>—<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335">an online multiplayer game</a><!--StartFragment -->—</span>instead of toward its next single-player adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But FromSoftware delivered with</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652"><i><span>Elden Ring Nightreign</span></i></a><span>. It didn’t just successfully nail multiplayer <em>Elden Ring;</em> it produced an entire new mash-up of genres that I wish more games would try to experiment with. Do you need close friends to get maximum enjoyment? Sure. But unlike some of the friendslop turning heads out there this year, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s magic goes far beyond capturing hot mics and silly moments. (It’s great for that too, though.) I now expect great things from<em> The Duskbloods</em> and would love to see FromSoftware reimagine </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> PVE for the modern era. -Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Star Wars: Fate of The Old Republic</em> Announced</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653099"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653099">©Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The 2025 Game Awards started off with a super-surprising announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076"><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></a>. This is a new single-player RPG from <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> director Casey Hudson, and is a spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em>. Holy shit, folks! Sure, it ain’t <em>KOTOR 3,</em> but it’s likely the closest we’ll ever get to that game, and that alone has fans excited.</p>

 <p>Before you start getting <em>too</em> hyped to play <em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> it should be noted that the studio working on <em>FOTOR</em> was formed just a few months ago, so this game is likely five or more years away from release and could launch on PlayStation 6 or even PS7.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-fotor-2030-casey-hudson-rpg-rumor-2000653419">Hudson denies this, however,</a> and claims it will be out before 2030. I want to believe him, but I’m not sold on that being possible unless <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is much smaller in scope than most AAA RPGs. We’ll just have to wait and see, and hope this one doesn’t get canceled.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Digital Foundry</em> And <em>Giant Bomb</em> Going Fully Independent&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002971"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002971">©Giant Bomb</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The digital games media space has never been more pervasive, thanks to creator platforms like TikTok and YouTube, but it’s also never been less able to support large institutional teams producing work that wouldn’t otherwise flourish on our algorithmically driven internet. </span><span>So it was heartening to see that despite the broader digital media apocalypse, there’s still room for once corporate-owned outlets to thrive in the indie space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">That includes the re-launch of <em>Giant Bomb</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a>, as well as things like <em>Game Informer</em> coming back to life with a physical magazine that you can actually buy IRL.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo Adds Virtual Boy Emulation To The Switch Online Catalog</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000227927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000227927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000227927">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>There aren’t many people around who fondly remember Nintendo’s failed stereoscopic 3D Virtual Boy console from 1995. It was a big flop for the company, was barely supported by it or third-party studios, and has mostly faded into the past as an odd misfire from the Mario maker.</p> <p>But it is still a part of video game history, and so it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">extremely unexpected but nice to see</a> Nintendo announce Virtual Boy games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. And to let you play these rudimentary 3D games properly, Nintendo is shipping a whole new headset accessory that looks a lot like the OG Virtual Boy. All of this arrives in February 2026.</p> <h2><strong><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> Was Worth The Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653434">©Reef Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>Back in February,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</i>was announced with&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a reveal trailer</a></u>&nbsp;that immediately propelled the game to the top of my most wanted list. With its beautiful pixel art and excellent animation,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate</i>&nbsp;looked like it might finally deliver the pulse-pounding run-and-gun action game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, but never received. Amping up my excitement in the months that followed were videos&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" data-sk="tooltip_parent">like this one</a></u>, which highlighted that the folks at developer Bitmap Bureau had the knowledge, skills, and experience to deliver a game that paid homage to the arcade action classics of yesteryear while also feeling exciting and rewarding today. But you never know for sure until a game arrives, so as hopeful as I was, I also feared that the end result might be a disappointing one.</p>

 <p>Originally set for release in September,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate&nbsp;</i>saw delay after delay, pushing it back to December 12 and making me more anxious than ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418">But the end result proved to be everything I hoped it could be</a>: a gorgeous, varied, challenging, and immensely rewarding action game that not only does the film justice, but earns a place among the best arcade-style action games of all time. What a wonderful surprise to help close out the year! – Carolyn Petit</p> <h2><strong><em>Helldivers 2</em> Comes To Xbox,<em> Gears Of War</em> Goes To PlayStation</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000318" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000318"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000318">©PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>The era of video game exclusives has truly come to an end. I mean, we all sort of knew that already, but in 2025, we watched it happen in real-time in a way that I’ve never seen before. On August 26,<a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"> <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, a remaster of a remake of the first game in the once Xbox-only series, arrived on PlayStation 5. On the very same day, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">PlayStation published <em>Helldivers 2</em> launched on Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>. It was like watching a prisoner exchange on a bridge between two nations that were once at war, but who now have struck a truce.</p>

 <p>And yeah,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092"> playing <em>Gears of War</em> on a PlayStation is strange</a>! I earned Xbox achievements on a PS5. We live in weird times. But I’m also happy that the future seems to be one in which you won’t need to own every console to play every game. That’s nice, and as consoles get more expensive, it will be a boon for gamers trying to enjoy the hobby on a limited budget.</p> <h2><strong>Id Software, Bethesda, and Ubisoft Studios In North America Unionize!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001754">©Bethesda / id Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Despite the bottom falling out of the AAA video game industry this year, gaming’s nascent labor movement has continued to eke out notable victories. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003">Multiple teams at Blizzard</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">announced new wall-to-wall unions</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">while developers at Bethesda</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">secured their first contract.</a> And the organizing isn’t just isolated to Microsoft-owned studios in the U.S.,<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"> Ubisoft Halifax in Canada just formed a union as well</a>. – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite’s</em> Mini-<em>Simpson</em>s Season Was Great, Actually!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640880">©Epic</figcaption></figure> <p>A mini <em>Fortnite</em> season based entirely on<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em> The Simpsons</em></a> could have been a disaster. But despite the odds, Epic was able to make it work and delivered what might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">my favorite season of <em>Fortnite</em> in a long time</a>. The Springfield island map was incredible to explore. The visuals felt very cartoonish and <em>Simpsons</em>-y without looking too garish, and all the <em>Simpsons</em> Easter eggs and characters that appeared throughout the event were a treat for fans. And on top of all that, this season included funny animated segments featuring <em>Simpsons</em> characters that were written by the staff of the show. Is this just one more sign of all of pop culture merging together into a grey slurry? Sure. But whatever, man, I can now play as Moe in <em>Fortnite</em>. I’m happy.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>Shadow-dropped</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000626874" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626874"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626874">©Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Years of marketing, teasers, and trailers are annoying and tiring. I mean, we’ve been waiting years for more information about <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> a game that was announced all the way back in 2018 when E3 was still a thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265">So getting a remake of 2006’s <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> out of nowhere was super nice.</a> No long waits. No delays. No annoying series of teasers and trailers. Just a reveal and boom, you were playing the game.</p> <p>Based on how well it did, people seem to agree that shadow-dropping a game like <em>Oblivion</em> is a good idea. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">Even Todd Howard seems into the idea</a> of launching games like this. And hey, <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> ended up being a solid and very pretty way to play (or replay) Bethesda’s seminal open-world RPG. Now, let’s hope next year’s list of best surprises features an entry about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster shadow-dropping out of nowhere.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> Finally Launches After A Long Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000619153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619153">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> could have easily been delayed out of 2025 or been disappointingly mid when it launched. Instead, it built on the foundation of the original without losing sight of what made that one so special. May every long-awaited sequel <em>*cough* </em></span><em><span>GTA 6</span></em><span><em> *cough*</em> manage to deliver the same.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p>
