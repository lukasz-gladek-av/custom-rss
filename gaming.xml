Both titles earned positive reviews, and if you’re a fan of the series, they’re an easy recommendation. Best of all, Into the Pit comes with a nice bonus when you purchase the physical edition.</p><p>Into the Pit’s physical edition is expected to arrive on June 20, while Help Wanted 2 will get physical editions for Switch and Xbox Series X around March 31 (though that date is likely to change). <strong>Preorders are now open ahead of their release</strong>, so consider reservering a copy if you plan on playing them later this year.</p><div title="6528746 - Into the Pit and Help Wanted 2 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3050" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528746 - Into the Pit and Help Wanted 2 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Five Nights at Freddy’s: Into the Pit</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DSLVYMGL,B0DSLVS2N6,B0DSLTKH3N,B0DSLTKBQR&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases June 20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The physical edition of Into the Pit will eventually launch for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-PlayStation/dp/B0DSLVS2N6?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-Xbox/dp/B0DSLTKBQR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Pit-PlayStation/dp/B0DSLTKH3N?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>, though only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Nights-Freddys-Into-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DSLVYMGL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> version is currently available to preorder.

                <p>Candy Crush is getting another feather in its cap. Rather than offering another twist on match-three puzzling, Candy Crush Solitaire will bring the franchise's sickly sweet aesthetic to the card game classic. It will be the first Candy Crush game to release after Microsoft's acquisition of developer King.</p><p>Candy Crush Solitaire bases itself on tripeaks solitaire, in which players must clear three "peaks" of cards. The game will feature familiar power-ups from Candy Crush, including jelly fish, the lollipop hammer, the color bomb, and the UFO. They will offer similar, but not exactly the same, powers as their match-three counterparts. Much like other Candy Crush games, the basic solitaire gameplay will be altered and made more challenging as players progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHVpfZIpPL8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lHVpfZIpPL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Candy Crush Solitaire will launch worldwide on February 6. Players can pre-register now on the app store of their choice and they'll receive some in-game rewards: 5,000 Coins, four undos, two fish cards, and three color bomb cards.</p><p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's now-completed acquisition of Activision Blizzard (which included King in its holdings) was still uncertain, Xbox boss Phil Spencer claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-activision-blizzard-deal-is-focused-on-candy-crush-not-call-of-duty/1100-6509176/" data-ref-id="1100-6509176">the purchase was more motivated by King</a>, and by extension the mobile market, than console games like Call of Duty. Since Microsoft's acquisition, Xbox has emphasized its mobile and Smart TV offerings with the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">This is an Xbox</a>" campaign.</p>

Health is basically zero. I need help. So I step past a demonic dog and enter a dark, ominous bathroom. I quickly knock on the lone stall inside. It creaks open, I hear...something inside and then a single soda can rolls out. Instead of drinking it, however, I gamble, and knock again. And once again it rolls me a soda. I don’t press my luck, instead returning to the aforementioned evil dog and giving it one of my soda pops. It chugs it and, in exchange, lets me reload my weapons faster. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196131,195410" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After that, it’s right back to the action of running for my life from a pixelated burning apartment while fighting cultists using a revolver, melee items, and my foot. It’s all very weird, but it’s also a blast, and I keep returning to play more <em>Cruel</em>, even though I keep dying over and over. </p><p>Over the last few years we’ve seen the rise of the boomer shooter subgenre of FPS games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">Stuff like <em>Cultic, Dusk, Fashion Police Squad</em>, and <em>40K Boltgun</em></a></span> all look like older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-shooters-2022-pc-destiny-warzone-fortnite-apex-1849853877">shooters</a></span> from the ‘90s, but often leverage new technology and decades of game design to create shooters that feel retro, but fresh. The latest of these boomer shooters to catch my attention with its fast-paced, roguelike action is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cruel</em>, out now on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>In <em>Cruel</em>, you play as someone trapped in a building that is burning floor by floor. Like any good character from a ‘90s-era FPS you are always running, which is helpful in this case as the fire will kill you quick if you linger. Each floor of the building is filled with cultists, evil ghosts, and soda machines. These machines will heal you if you need it, or you can use the soda to upgrade your character between floors. </p><p>And you’ll need those upgrades, as each floor gets harder and introduces new enemies with better weapons. And if you drink all your soda, well, you can always gamble in the bathroom and hope the evil monster in there gives you a soda and doesn’t jumpscare you and kill you where you stand. Like I said, it’s a weird experience. </p><p>But <em>Cruel’s </em>oddball setup isn’t what keeps me coming back to the game death after death. Instead, it’s the game’s crisp, responsive, and retro-inspired FPS combat. Guns are loud. Enemies pop when you get that perfect headshot. And one mistake can end a perfect run. Then again, if you use all the tools <em>Cruel</em> provides you with—slides, kicks, and melee weapons—you can often improvise your way out of a bad situation. </p><p><em>Cruel </em>reminds me of last year’s <em>Anger Foot</em>, but with better combat and a crunchier, more boomer shooter-inspired aesthetic. The soundtrack is a banger to boot. Oh, and if you click the reload button when your gun has full ammo, your character flips it in the area. 10 out of 10. Love it! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689470/CRUEL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At only $10 and under 400MB</a></span>, <em>Cruel </em>is a perfect bite-sized FPS to kick the new year off with, just don’t gamble too much in the bathroom. Trust me. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2023, Evil Geniuses won VALORANT Champions, claiming just the third ever world championship in Riot’s tactical FPS. Less than two years later, only one face remains: coach Christine “potter” Chi.</p>



<p>Potter, a former Counter-Strike pro who first joined EG as a player in 2021, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potter-signs-three-year-extension-with-eg-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed an extension this offseason</a> to continue coaching through 2027. The team also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed Jacob “icy” Lange and once-upon-a-time best player in the world Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the goal for potter is the same as it always is: do more with less.</p>



<hr>



<p>Insider Gaming had the opportunity to sit down with potter at the VCT Americas Media Day. The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: At the SEN City Classic you talked about wanting to work with that roster specifically, but what led to the team ending up with icy as opposed to&nbsp;Tyler “sym” Porter?</strong></p>



<p>“My mindset towards rosters has always been tunneled towards making it work, no matter what. I’ve never looked at it from the angle of ‘when can I replace this player?’ So when I said that at the time, I fully believed that would be our roster in 2025.</p>



<p>After that tournament though, it was clear there were some issues with sym. I do really wish we could have made it work; sym is incredibly talented, he’s really hungry, an incredible teammate and a really good human. But the time issue was always on my mind, with trying to bring yay into a comfortable environment and highlighting him to be successful. We need to make sure everyone was playing their roles properly, especially with all of yay’s role changes and not being as comfortable on the sentinel role.</p>



<p>This roster that we’re going into Kickoff with, this combination of players turned out to be better for us.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Potter lifts the trophy at Champions 2023. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>IG: The last time you kept the same roster core between years was from 2022 to 2023, and we all know how well 2023 turned out. How important is it to keep the same core together through the offseason?</strong></p>



<p>“It’s so important. Even at that time, I was getting so much shit from the community, my peers, from some in management about replacing certain players on that 2023 roster. But I knew keeping a core was going to be important. All the work, all the small annoyances that teams have to do that take so much time, that was already out of the way [in 2023].</p>



<p>And it’s the same with this roster in 2025. We took last year to hash out a lot of those details, to learn about each other, get those fundamentals down. All those things are done. And yeah we lost Alexander “jawgemo” Mor, and that fucking hurt really badly, and it hurt us as a team. But, we put in a lot of work last year, and we feel very confident about that work we put in.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: What do you hope to see out of both yay and Icy? What can they bring to the table that VCT Americas viewers haven’t seen yet?</strong></p>



<p>“Over the last three years, EG has been a place where every player ends up not by choice, but more so by how things turned out. Each player has their own hunger, and drive, and story they want to rewrite for themselves. And that’s always been my strength: having these misfit players with their own desperate drive they need to prove. I see exactly [those kind of players] in yay and icy. </p>



<figure><figcaption>In his OpTic days, yay was regarded as the best VALORANT player in the world. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With yay, he’s gonna have to prove that he’s not just a Chamber main. That’s his ultimate goal. He’s swapped over to the sentinel role, and every day it’s a work in progress. We have El Diablo on our team, but we still need him to do his job, which sometimes isn’t as sexy as going out there and getting three crispy headshots. Sometimes he’s gonna have to play off of his trip, and it’s small things like this we’re working out as a team. He’s such a capable player, but sometimes being that capable can bait you into into certain engagements that don’t make sense.</p>



<p>For icy, he’s an incredible role player. His IQ is up there, he’s humble, and he’s a very sacrificial duelist. As a duelist, you have to be greedy, but you also have to be willing to go in there and die for your team. So my focus for him is to highlight his mechanical skill. That consistency wasn’t there last year, and I’m hoping he finds that here on this roster.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: You had the prestige and name power to go coach another team. What made you want to stay with EG?</strong></p>



<p>“I did get a lot of offers, and they were all exactly the same: building up a roster of misfits or players that need to prove themselves from tier two or tier three. I did want to look at a team that was willing to spend the big bucks on big names, but that didn’t work out. A lot of the rumors are true. I did look into NRG, and those talks did go pretty far, but they went a different route. At that point it was either go somewhere brand new and do what I’m already doing here, or continue what I’ve done at EG with the core I’ve already built here.</p>



<p>I fully believe in Phat “supamen” Le, in the same way I was fully convinced jawgemo was going to be the best duelist at the end of the year. Turns out he wasn’t even our main duelist!”</p>



<p><strong>IG: He wasn’t even the best duelist on EG!</strong></p>



<p>“[Laughs] Right! And NaturE is a top IGL. He and I have worked so long together, and we’re in that sweet spot. And Derrek is casually good, and I like that. In practice and matches, he’s not straining for highlights. His energy is fantastic.</p>



<p>I really stayed because I believe in this core. I think we made the right roster moves. Yay is a big question mark, but he absolutely is elevating us and catapulting us up like how Ethan and Demon1 did in 2023. So I’m excited about this roster.”</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is getting local co-op support next month - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.
</p>
<p>
Not coincidentally, of course, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix (which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a>) and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Epic has now revealed that, from Tuesday 14th January, Fortnite Festival will get a little closer to capturing the social spirit of those heady Rock Band days, by letting multiple players jam away in the comfort of the same room - but only on Xbox and PlayStation. The company hasn't shared much in the way of specifics just yet, but judging by the <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921">excessively elaborate, Snoop Dogg-starring trailer</a> it's released to announce the new feature, it'll support local co-op for up to four players, as well as the simultaneous use of two plastic guitars.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER ‼️</p><p>Local multiplayer is coming to Fortnite Festival on Xbox and PlayStation January 14!  Stay *tuned* for more details 🎸 <a href="https://t.co/m5hzBmbCtw">pic.twitter.com/m5hzBmbCtw</a></p></div>— Fortnite Festival (@FNFestival) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
This marks the first major new feature for Fortnite Festival this year, and follows Epic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">confirmation last December</a> that it would continue to support its rhythm game through "2025 and beyond". It made those assurances after revealing it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">no longer be releasing themed updates for Fortnite's Rocket Racing</a>, which has struggled to maintain player numbers since being introduced alongside Fornite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in 2023.
</p><p>
The arrival of Fortnite Festival's local co-op support on 14th January coincides with the end of the mode's current Snoop Dogg-themed season and the start of the next, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">likely see Vocaloid popstar Hatsune Miku step in as the latest featured artist</a>.

		<p>The first full week of the year definitely picked up the pace again, and there’s been plenty of headlines, new trailers and general stuff happening in video games. And there’s also new games coming out sooner than you might think!</p>
<p>I’ve had an old platformer on the go that you’ll hear about next week, and&nbsp;I also played a few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to cobble together a preview video for the game earlier today.</p>
<p>But it’s <strong>Gamoc</strong> who on point for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, and it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">his first impressions</a> that we were able to share in our final preview. He’s really been enjoying it so far, so keep your eyes peeled for our review next month! That’s not all he’s been playing, though. There’s also been some bits of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Black Ops 6, and Terraria with his sister (who’s having to put up with just having a PS4 for the time being).</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> also been playing Kingdom Come… but only the first one – “My enjoyment took a momentary dip during the notoriously dull monastery main quest in which you become a novice monk, performing mundane daily duties while also investigating which of your fellow brothers is a criminal. It was great in terms of historical immersion but was surprisingly punishing. I much preferred my next quest, giving the villagers of Pribyslavitz a good telling off for pooing in the nearby river.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> continuing adventures through The Witcher 3 have taken him through Novigrad, where he’s just picking up quests and some Witcher contracts. He’s also been on the sidelines of Football Manager 24, getting Valencia to the Champions League semi finals, but getting knocked out, meaning he’s just got the slimmest of hopes left for a league win if Real Madrid and Barcelona ever slip up.</p>

<p>There’s been a fair bit of Marvel Rivals for <strong>Jason</strong>, where he’s been having to do an awful lot of carrying as the team healer. Alongside that it’s been Atlyss – &nbsp;“a very enjoyable MMO-style game with some, uh, very specific character models.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> and his wife have reached the final credits of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, so now there’s just all the catching of fishes, bugs and everything else still to do!</p>
<p>While <strong>Dom</strong> was feeling like he was going to be crushed under the sheer weight of a Lenovo Legion Go – he is, after all, a very small person, and it is a large handheld – <strong>Miguel</strong> has been mainlining gacha games including Girls Frontline 2, some Zenless Zone Zero, a pinch of Nikke and a whisper of Honkai Star Rail. Also some Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on PSP!</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> wrapped up and enjoyed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (except for that stupid map), and so has gone back to Another Crab’s Treasure. He also played the first few hours of Alone in the Dark on PS5 and trawled through FromSoftware’s back catalogue to play Ninja Blade on 360 – his PC version is stuck in German, somehow?</p>

<p>And aside from being disappointed by the final act of Destiny 2’s story after The Final Shape, <strong>Tuff’s</strong> been playing “writing a CV” for the first time in 28 years, which is both a new and old experience.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

Here’s how to fix that:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Turn on your PS5</li><li>Go to the gear icon on the far right of the home screen to access settings</li><li>Choose the storage option and open up the media folder</li><li>toggle over to the trophy category and then select all and hit delete</li></ol><figure id="" data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like I said, it’s a very simple fix that’s easy to overlook. At least that’s what I tell myself to explain why I never noticed this until now. Usually I’m sorting through albums for various games trying to figure out what precious clips I want to delete to try and win back one precious gigabyte here and another there from my precious SSD space. In addition to everything else, the dedicated trophy section of the media folder makes it easy to quickly nuke a ton of footage without worrying.</p><p>After that, you can go and change the settings for what’s recorded when you earn a trophy. It can be just a screenshot, or you can limit captures to only gold or platinum trophies. If you’re serious about documenting all of that stuff, then by all means feel free to hang onto it or move it to an external drive before purging. I am not, and instantly got back 7GB of storage. </p><p>That’s not much when it comes to behemoth game file sizes like <em>Destiny 2 </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, but as someone who recently went through their digital collection and downloaded a ton of stuff I’ve never played, 7GB is enough to install half a dozen smaller indie games or older PlayStation classics. One of these days I’ll install a bigger SSD. Until then, thank you, wolfgang784, for the super useful tip. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Metroid fans have been waiting for the better part of two decades for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The sequel was officially announced in June 2017, and Amazon put up preorders sometime after that. Through the game's extended development, those orders still stood. Now, even after last summer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">re-reveal of Metroid Prime 4</a>, Amazon is canceling those longstanding preorders.</p><p>Presumably this is a mistake on Amazon's end, rather than anything dire like another delay for Metroid Prime 4 or even a cancelation of the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment. At least one person on GameSpot's staff noted that his six-year-old Metroid Prime 4 preorder--which was discounted to $48--was among the canceled orders today.</p><p>Following the initial announcement in 2017, Nintendo updated the status of Metroid Prime 4 in 2019 when it was revealed that the previous development was being abandoned in favor of a fresh start with Retro Studios, the same studio that developed the Metroid Prime trilogy. During the years between announcements, a standalone title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> and a remastered edition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were released on Switch. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-2-and-3-are-reportedly-still-coming-to-switch/1100-6511589/" data-ref-id="1100-6511589">are both reportedly getting remasters for Switch</a> as well.</p><p>Aside from those games, Metroid's leading woman, Samus Aran, remains a regular in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. But to stay current with Samus' in-continuity adventures, you should probably brush up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-the-series-story-so-far/1100-6524350/" data-ref-id="1100-6524350">everything that's happened in the Metroid Prime games so far</a>. Nintendo recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/" data-ref-id="1100-6527895">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be released in 2025</a>, but it doesn't currently have an exact date.</p>

That means we are now entering the 12th year of Sony’s home console. Usually, at this point in a console’s lifetime there are few if any new games being released for it. However, that’s not the case with the PS4, as there are over 20 games scheduled to arrive on the aging machine in 2025. </p><p>Here are 22 new games coming to PS4 (and other platforms) this year. Keep in mind this likely isn’t a complete list and it’s possible that more games will be announced for PS4 later in the year.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em></strong> (PS5/PS4, Switch) - January 7</li><li><strong><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch) - January 10</li><li><strong><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 17</li><li><strong><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 23</li><li><strong><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - January 30</li><li><strong><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, PC, Switch) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI </em>Remastered</strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S ) - February 21</li><li><strong><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</em></strong><em> </em>(PS4, PS5, PC, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 6</li><li><strong><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Atomfall</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 27</li><li><strong><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - April 24</li><li><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, PC, Mobile) - June</li><li><strong><em>Double Dragon Revive</em></strong> (PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX/S) - October 23</li><li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> </strong>(PS4/5, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></strong> (PC, Switch, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Splitgate 2</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS5, PS4, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>The House of the Dead 2: Remake</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>WWE 2K25</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li></ol><p>Now, as mentioned before with the PS2, it’s not unheard of for very popular video game consoles to keep receiving new game releases a decade after the device first hit the market. A big install base is a big install base. But usually, this far into a console’s lifespan, you might get, say, one or two new games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For example, in 2018</a></span>—12 years after the PlayStation 3 launched—we got two new PS3 games, and one was <em>FIFA 19. </em></p><p>What we’re seeing with the PS4 in its 12th year is unlike anything in modern gaming history. Nearly two dozen games, at least, are set to arrive on PS4 this year, and not all of them are sports games or old ports. Some are brand new remasters, others are smaller 2D titles, and some are big AAA games like <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> and <em>Elden Ring Nightreign.</em> </p><h2 id="h245124"><a id=""></a>Console generations aren’t the same as before</h2><p>And before someone jumps on me for suggesting PS4 games launching in 2025 is a bad thing, let me be clear: I’m not saying that. Most AAA video game studios have moved on to more powerful hardware, so I don’t think the industry is being held back by the PS4 (or the Xbox One, for that matter, which is also getting new games.)</p><p>The reality is that in 2025, the video game industry and market are very different than they once were. Back in the era of the PS2 and even PS3, tech was advancing rapidly from 2D to 3D to HD to 4K. New consoles felt more necessary every few years. That’s not the case in 2025. </p><p>The PS4 is still a fairly capable machine, especially for indie devs or people making smaller games or RPGs using pre-established tools and tech. And thanks to digital marketplaces, you don’t need to stock your game at Walmart to sell copies. It also helps that modern engines like Unreal and Unity are very scalable and flexible, so a single game can run on Switch, PS4, PS5, and even mobile devices. </p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that some of the most popular games around right now—<em>Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Genshin Impact, Overwatch 2, GTA Online, Minecraft, </em>and <em>Roblox</em>—are all on PS4, and still receive updates each month. There’s a giant group of players who don’t feel the need to move on because the big games they play every week are still active and alive on PS4, so it’s not shocking that devs are still making plenty of games for the 12-year-old console in 2025. </p><p>The real question now is whether the PS4 can last longer than the PS2. I think it can. Even if, come next year, we only see half as many PS4 games launch as we get in 2025, that’ll still be over 10. We might even be getting PS4 games up until and beyond the launch of a theoretical PS6. Wild stuff. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this week, Los Angeles and surrounding cities in California were struck by multiple wildfires and intense Santa Ana winds that caused catastrophic damage to Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and other areas. Major Hollywood events and pro sports games were canceled in the wake of the fires. However, Niantic has announced that it still plans to go forward with next month's Pokemon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles event in Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium.</p><p>"Our team has been carefully observing the situation in Los Angeles with the well-being of Pasadena, greater Los Angeles, and of course our Niantic community," said Niantic's director of communications, Mark Van Lommel, in a statement to <a href="https://dotesports.com/pokemon/news/niantic-is-carefully-observing-the-situation-in-los-angeles-ahead-of-pokemon-go-unova-tour" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dos Esports</a>. "While we are currently continuing our preparations, any updates regarding the event will be shared as they become available."</p><p>The Los Angeles fires are still ongoing and have been hugely devastating to the community and the people who live there. Information about <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/wildfires/heres-how-to-help-those-impacted-by-the-wildfires-across-southern-california/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to help the affected victims can be found here</a>.</p><p>Although the wildfires have also struck Pasadena, the Rose Bowl is currently undamaged and available for the Pokemon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles on February 21-23. Prior to the fires, Niantic announced that the event will mark the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-january-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-day-and-more/1100-6528604/" data-ref-id="1100-6528604">Pokemon Go</a> debut of Black Kyurem and White Kyurem ahead of their global rollout on March 1.</p><p>Late last year, Niantic revealed that it has used the activities of Pokemon Go players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-used-pokemon-go-players-to-create-real-world-ai-navigation-model/1100-6527871/" data-ref-id="1100-6527871">to create a real-world AI navigation model</a>. While Niantic subsequently said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want its AI model used for war</a>, the company didn't rule out selling the data to governments. In other Pokemon news, the Japanese mob is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using Pokemon cards to launder money</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a preview of an upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This more experimental spin-off of a Secret Lair, which quietly launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in December</a>, is continuing its eclectic streak with some new psychedelic land cards.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault 2025 Drop</h2>

<p>IN an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast briefly restates the intention of the Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. They are designed to be unexpected. Sales launching at unexpected times to selling unexpected items. The post also confirms an email list for updates on future Chaos Vault drops.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=d_h9_YkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=JUXqkmW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post continues with a preview of the drop. Starting "sometime next week" the next drop will feature new basic land cards. These land cards showcase a vibrant art style with abstract, rainbow-like colors by artist Scott Balmer. They look more like background vignettes to a prog-rock album than a fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>If you are worried about cost, this latest Chaos Vault drop will try something different. Buying this Chaos Vault drop will get you ten copies of each basic land card by popular demand. That is fifty cards in total as part of this drop. In keeping with the chaotic nature of these drops, there is no current listed price.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Vf-wST80 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Bd4yyP-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, the post ends with a tease of what other Chaos Vault drops will entail. It features several pieces of artwork by Rhonda Libbey, Heikala, Ashley Mackenzie, and kelogsloops. The artwork moves back and forth between watercolor vignettes, cozy anime imagery, and impressionistic koi ponds.</p>

<p>This promise of experimentality is in keeping with the first Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. That drop, titled the Fairest Drop of All, had several cards in the style of art deco title plates. One card was illustrated in full profile. If this is maintained, Chaos Vault could serve as an outlet for alternative artists and to entice players with more eclectic taste.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-rumored-to-also-get-gears-of-war-hellblade-ii-and-age-of-mythology-from-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PS5 users might be treated to a full wave of Xbox games in 2025 as Microsoft continues its third-party push. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames is coming in Spring 2025, and DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PS5 at launch, but there's a lot more coming from Microsoft-owned studios.</p>
<p>Earlier today, insider Nate the Hate <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the latest rumors he heard from his industry sources. According to him, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo The Master Chief Collection will be released sometime this year for Sony's PlayStation 5 and even for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> having heard the same rumors about these games making the jump to other consoles. He also added a few more titles that are reportedly being prepared for a PS5 debut: Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and even Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The latter in particular would mark the arrival of one of the most iconic Xbox franchises on its main console rival. Sure, it's a very old game at this point (the Ultimate Edition remaster launched in 2015), but it could be a sign that more games in the franchise originally created by Epic and now handled by The Coalition could be ported. After all, there have been rumors of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-collection-rumored-to-be-coming-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War Collection</a> for years.</p>
<p>The announcement of the other two would definitely be easier to handle for Xbox fans. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great game in its own right</a> (albeit far too similar to the first installment), but it's also a niche title that could certainly use all the sales it can get. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology Retold</a> (which, however, still isn't available on Xbox consoles, either).</p>
<p>By the way, Corden even said these games could be released on the Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the PS5. Personally, I do have some doubts regarding Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, as that is a rather heavy game that might be really challenging to port onto a platform that is rumored to be quite a bit weaker than the Xbox Series S.</p>

In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
