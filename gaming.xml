<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/</link>
            <guid>1366738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>

<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Interview With Post Launch Director Simon... (AC Shadows DLC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Iijrbz8XBc?start=559&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Alienware 16 Aurora Gaming Laptop Was Pricier Than a MacBook Air at Launch, Now Black Friday Makes It Even Cheaper Than One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/treat-yourself-or-a-gamer-in-your-life-with-the-16-inch-alienware-aurora-gaming-laptop-while-its-discounted-2000648026</link>
            <guid>1366729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals’ November 27 patch introduced the 18v18 Annihilation game mode. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is now live, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-roadmap-reveals-date-for-rogue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> tells us when all the new characters, maps, events, and more are arriving in the game. However, the developers have released a brand-new patch to celebrate Marvel Rivals’ first anniversary. Along with the new mode, players also receive a new map, events, fixes, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-18v18-annihilation-is-a-domination-showdown">Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation is a Domination Showdown</h2>



<p>Unveiled through a new trailer, Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation game mode will take place on a new map called Grand Garden, where players will participate in a Domination Showdown. The trailer reveals how chaotic this mode can get, with swarms of heroes piling up on both sides. At the same time, it also provides opportunities for players to take down waves of other players when timing their ultimates correctly. Check out the new trailer below: </p>

They’ve been able to cheat their way into locked rooms as before, but what they now find inside… well, Embark called it a “very hot fix” for a reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forward_Problem_7550 discovered</a>, locked rooms now turn you into a fireball if you glitch inside. The clip below shows the trap in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the change is positive, with most players getting a kick out of what Embark has done here. “Best part of this is the clowns doing the glitch lose all their stuff to someone who legitimately opens the door with a key. CLASSIC!” enthused A_Tortured_Crab. “It's genuinely a really good fix,” added vedomedo. “Hopefully this is the mindset they keep going forward. Punish the exploiters and reward legit players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, some players are saying they’re more inclined to use their keys to enter locked rooms legitimately in the hope of finding “some dingus who hasn't read the patch notes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically this isn’t a fix, as players can still use the exploit to enter locked rooms. But it is an eye-catching workaround, and will surely put off players from trying to cheat their way inside a room after they’ve been cooked once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would’ve been better if they just didn’t say anything and rolled this out,” suggested Maverixk_. “Imagine all the door glitches finding this out and losing all of their s**t before word of mouth spread.

</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's your favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Timesplitters</a> game?</p>
<p>Did you say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Future Perfect</a>? Or even the first one, aptly named "<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a>"? Good, we're gonna get along just fine!</p>
<p>Now, whilst we're not here to announce a new version of Timesplitters 1, 2, or 3 for Switch consoles or anything amazing like <em>that</em>, almost as excitingly, a fan-made re-imagining composed of a campaign mash-up of all three games alongside a huge multiplayer suite of multiplayer challenge maps and modes, has finally — after 13 long years — <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">been released to the public on PC</a>. And it's going down well with anyone in the know.</p>

<p>We've been following the progress of this one for a long while now on and off, and it's absolutely been a real labour of love for its creators, Cinder Interactive, having worked on this project in some form or another since way back when Crytek gave them their full IP blessing off the back of a Timesplitters mod for <strong>Unreal Tournament 2004</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, that transports us back, kids. In fact, you should really check out the <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/about">extensive Project History over at the game's official site</a> to take in the full and fascinating story behind the twists and turns in bringing this new game to life.</p>
<p>So, it's a bit of a surprise, and certainly something worth highlighting, that after a number of setbacks and just how long it's taken, Timesplitters: Rewind has finally released. It's actually real! Furthermore, and if you've checked out the trailer above, we're sure you'll agree, it looks absolutely STONKING. And it's free.</p>
<p>Ah. Timesplitters. Just when we thought we were out (to be fair, we've been out for a couple of decades) you've gone and dragged us right back in. Now, where's our GameCube controllers?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple releases new MacBook iterations almost annually with more powerful custom silicon that pushes performance boundaries forward. <strong>March brought the MacBook Air with M4 chip</strong>, succeeding the previous M3 generation through enhanced efficiency and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Each year follows the same pattern where Apple maintains strict full pricing across official channels to preserve premium brand positioning. But today, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">at $749, down from $999, this marks the first time Apple has authorized Amazon to sell the 256GB MacBook Air M4</a> at razor-thin or potentially zero profit margins for Black Friday. The <strong>25% discount</strong> represents unprecedented accessibility to current-generation MacBooks that typically resist price reductions for years after launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Portable Computing</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 processor has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU</strong> architecture that can handle professional workflows while being fanless and weighing less than 3 pounds. The improved Neural Engine processes Apple Intelligence features on the device which keeps data private because it doesn’t send it to cloud servers where third parties could get to sensitive information. The fanless cooling works well enough because the processor doesn’t get too hot even when it’s under a lot of stress: This makes it quiet, which professionals like when they’re working with clients or in the library.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB unified memory is a big improvement</strong> over the old 8GB base configurations which made it hard for users to run more than one program at a time. This memory architecture lets<strong> the CPU and GPU share RAM</strong> which gets rid of the performance problems that happen when separate components copy data between different memory pools. The memory bandwidth sends data to processors quickly enough to keep them running at their best, instead of waiting for slow memory access that slows down less powerful systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has great picture quality thanks to mini-LED backlighting</strong> that lets it reach 500 nits brightness and supports the P3 wide color gamut. This level of brightness makes it easy to see outside in direct sunlight, where regular laptop screens wash out completely. The color accuracy is also good enough for professional photo and video editing without needing extra monitors<strong>. True Tone technology changes the white balance based on the light around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip and optimized macOS power management</strong> that changes performance based on workload demands make the battery last 15 to 18 hours during normal mixed use. <strong>Video playback can last up to 20 hours</strong> but tasks that use a lot of power, like rendering video, drain batteries faster but still give you a lot of time to use them without plugging them in. This long battery life lets you work on the go instead of just using a laptop that is tethered to a power source and covers full workdays and evenings without having to worry about running out of battery.</p>
<p>The <strong>integration of the ecosystem with the iPhone</strong> makes workflows easier with features like Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy text or images from your iPhone and paste them directly into your Mac. Handoff lets you switch between devices in the middle of a task, and FaceTime and Messages keep conversations going no matter which device you pick up. And AirDrop lets you send files between Apple devices right away.</p>
<p>For $749, the MacBook Air M4 with 256GB has the latest Apple Silicon, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and a battery that lasts all day. This Black Friday, it’s 25% off the regular price. Apple’s authorization for Amazon to sell at minimal margins creates exceptional value that rarely occurs on current MacBooks. If you want Apple’s latest ultra-portable without paying full premium pricing, <strong>this record-low deal is the best MacBook value available</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/googles-newest-and-best-pixel-watch-is-100-off-for-the-first-time-this-black-friday-at-amazon-2000647344</link>
            <guid>1366678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of 2025’s best Android smartwatches has just become one of the best Black Friday deals of the week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">The 41mm version of the outstanding Google Pixel Watch 4 is 22% off at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $350.</a> The best-in-class display jumps out at you immediately, being 50% brighter than the previous model of the Pixel Watch, and its Gemini AI integration comes into play early and often to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>As a fitness watch, the Pixel Watch 4 is among the very best, with amazing accuracy in measuring and evaluating your exercise. It’s also an elite-level health and sleep tracker, easily in the same class as the best Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches. All of its features are bolstered by the outstanding battery life of the Pixel Watch 4 — 40 hours per charge in standard mode and 72 hours in low-power mode, with the ability to get back to 50% strength after just 15 minutes on Google’s new side charger, and all the way from 0 to 100% in roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to look past the face of the Google Pixel Watch 4, which is an enormous upgrade from previous models. The first-of-its-kind Actua 360 display lives beneath a dome of sturdy scratch-resistant 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and is 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 — up to 3,000 brilliant nits, which can be lowered to as little as a single nit when you need to keep things dark. It’s a 320 ppi AMOLED screen that’s remarkably easy to see even in bright sun, and highly reactive as a touchscreen for ease of control.</p>
<p>Beneath the Actua 360 display lives the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor and Cortex M55 co-processor, which drives all of the Pixel Watch 4’s many features and keeps them moving with smooth, seamless, pro-level speed. That’s handy whether you’re using any of the 40+ exercise modes for a workout, the dual-frequency GPS for accurate location, or the Gemini AI as a hands-free assistant for pretty much anything you ask of it.</p>



<h2>An Actual Fixable Smartwatch</h2>
<p>What do you do when your smartwatch’s battery fails, or when its display gets cracked or damaged? Most likely you shop for a new one while hoping against hope for a semi-reasonable trade-in deal to lessen the blow. The Google Pixel Watch 4’s battery is replaceable, as it its display. You can’t do it yourself at home, but it can be shipped to Google or taken to a certified Google repair technician for a fix. Of course, with its robust battery and Gorilla Glass-encased display combined with IP68 water and dust resistance, the odds are low you’ll need to seek service, but it does provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Need a Cliff’s Notes rundown of the Pixel Watch 4’s many fitness features? How about Daily Readiness score, real-time run guidance, Morning Brief, Heart Zone Training, Cardio fitness score, Calorie Tracking, and Floors Climbed? That’s maybe a third of them, just to give you an idea of how impressive the Pixel Watch 4 is if you’re thinking about a new workout watch. And now’s the time to make that upgrade, thanks to the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">22% off Black Friday sale at Amazon that makes the Google Pixel Watch 4 a total steal at just $350.</a></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that in-game audio issues will receive a “full pass” to solve them. </p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield 6 has been out for close to two months now, and the game has already received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-drops-to-half-price-for-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discount</a> due to a Black Friday mega sale on one platform. However, as sales and marketing for the title progress, the developers are also constantly working to resolve issues, and now they have set their sights on BF6’s in-game audio problems. </p>

Le Bihan stated that “the entire in-game audio is receiving a full pass to solve those issues, including fixing some issues that caused some sounds to completely cut.” The principal designer added that they are still working on the problems and verifying the changes, and they hope to share more details soon. </p>



<p>Florian Le Bihan also spoke about Battlefield 6’s mouse-and-keyboard issues in the same thread. He first confirmed that fine-tuning mouse sensitivity “broke with the last update” and will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For keyboards, he was asked whether Class-related keybinds can be removed, and Le Bihan confirmed that those buttons will be removed from the keyboard after the next patch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Niko Partners, the analytics firm covering the video game industry in Asia and MENA markets, published <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-news/">its latest weekly report</a>, which points to a potential source of problems for the Japanese video game market. As geopolitical tensions between Japan and China continue to rise, China might be inclined to take retaliatory actions, like starting to deny approval of Japanese games.</p>



<p>According to Niko Partners, "<em>Japan is the single largest source of import game approvals to China</em>, <em>accounting for roughly 30% of all licensed foreign titles over the past two years</em>." We know that China is a massive market that any publisher would want to be able to crack, since that would be millions of potential players. </p>



<p>Though the firm clarifies that there's been no indication China would stop approving games from Japan, it's definitely a possibility, and would be a huge blow to Japanese developers and publishers who have much of their business tied to Chinese players.</p>



<p>Issues between the two nations are currently rising due to comments from Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who recently suggested, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-diplomat-dissatisfied-japan-talks-000859056.html?guccounter=1">per Bloomberg</a>, that Japan could interfere with China attempting to reunify Taiwan.</p>



<p>China has now called on Japan to retract the comments, and has already begun taking actions such as having flights cancelled and travel advisories issued on travel to Japan, suspending the importing of Japanese seafood, and pausing the approval of Japanese films.</p>



<p>With film approvals already getting paused, it's not a huge leap to imagine video games are next. We'll see how the rest of it continues to unfold, but if their relationship continues to decline, then it'll likely be quite some time <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">before we see the Nintendo Switch 2 make it over to China.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hasn't sold as well as publishers Paradox predicted. As such, the company have announced plans to write-down 355 million Swedish Krona (approximately £28 million/$37 million) of the game's development costs - essentially the financial way of saying something along the lines of 'oops, this isn't worth as much as we thought it was'.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">notice</a> announcing this write-down Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said the game's a "strong vampire fantasy" and that Paradox are pleased with the work that's gone into it from developers The Chinese Room. As such, the finger of blame's being pointed at Paradox themselves for having overtly high expectations regarding how well Bloodlines 2 would do financially.</p>
<p>"A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down," Wester said. "The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales."</p>
<p>Here are the bits which are relevant to those of us who aren't here to look at Paradox's money numbers. In light of this, Wester said the publisher will "evaluate how we best develop" World of Darkness games going forwards, but stressed that Bloodlines 2 will still be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-latest-patch-offers-up-fixes-as-a-roadmap-promises-more-improvements">the additions</a> which have already been set in stone for it. "Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year," Wester confirmed. So, if you bought the premium edition, you'll still get the two expansions you paid for.</p><p>Paradox's admission here follows departed Chinese Room co-founder Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-should-have-been-called-something-else-agrees-former-creative-director">recently revealing</a> that the studio started trying to convince the publishers to call the game something other than Bloodlines 2 was a priority for him almost as soon as he became involved in the project, which bumped from studio to studio during development. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>," Pinchbeck recalled.</p>
<p>The name didn't change, leaving Bloodlines 2 as a game that in the eyes of many is defined as much by what it isn't as what it is. "The overall problem here is that in a year packed with absolutely amazing games of all shapes and sizes, Bloodlines 2 is merely okay," wrote Dominic Tarason in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>. "An entertaining mid-budget way to pass a few evenings in a familiar setting."</p>

It’s a special Thanksgiving Day Edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">HUNTR/X performing “Golden” at the 99th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York <a href="https://t.co/QTloRwAlL2">pic.twitter.com/QTloRwAlL2</a></p> <p>— EJAE Updates (@EjaeUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/EjaeUpdates/status/1994076633444340080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE LABUBU FLOAT IM SCREAMING <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MacysParade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MacysParade</a> <a href="https://t.co/yMyMKds3Sn">pic.twitter.com/yMyMKds3Sn</a></p> <p>— SΞAN (@Seanlofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/Seanlofficial/status/1994060209296162853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Super Mario float in the Thanksgiving Parade! <a href="https://t.co/TapXBzg5gk">pic.twitter.com/TapXBzg5gk</a></p> <p>— TY!

But it was actually the obligatory <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> performance that stole the show. And if you see the Labubu float break containment, well, please call 911. Meanwhile, I’m jealously checking in on everyone else’s <a href="https://x.com/i/lists/1460694648381448196">Black Friday gaming haul</a>. Now let me go check on my candied yams before they burn.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is a $37 million flop</h2> <p>Paradox Interactive announced the write-down <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">to investors yesterday</a>. It takes full responsibility for the game’s troubled reception following years of development hell and multiple studios at the helm. The RPG is currently sitting below a 60 percent positive rating on Steam.</p>

 <p><em>“</em>A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future,” CEO Fredrik Wester said.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> won’t get a second expansion</h2> <p>“As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently,” associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>. “We’re still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it’s not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years. And whether or not this is the the right way to go, I think it’s more an experience we’re trying, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it.”</p>

 <p>He suggests that the game’s original delay and resources spent on improving the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> engine are the reason a second big DLC felt out of <em>Shadows</em> post-launch roadmap, rather than soft sales or a lack of player interest.</p>

 <h2><em>The Witcher 4</em> won’t be at The Game Awards 2025</h2> <p>“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">on X</a>. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>

 <h2>The backlash to OpenAI’s war on anime continues</h2> <p>The Japan Commercial Broadcasters’ Association released a new statement pushing back on AI plagiarism machines. The group is “strongly urging generative AI developers,” <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASTCV2RG1TCVUCVL06NM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>Asahi Shimbun</u></a> reports (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/openai-and-sora-2s-use-of-anime-ips-could-destroy-japans-content-production-culture-and-ecosystem-says-japans-biggest-broadcasting-association"><em>IGN</em></a>). The association also called on OpenAI to “respond sincerely to claims made by member companies in regard to copyright infringement caused by generative AI.” I’m sure that will happen any day now.</p> <h2>The great <em>Pokémon</em> vs <em>Digimon</em> debate</h2> <p>“Digimon and Pokémon are fundamentally different in their core concepts and appeal,”&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> producer Ryosuke Hara said in a <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/issue-1005-of-mcv-develop-is-online-now-inside-ryosuke-hara-on-digimon-story-time-stranger-paul-sulyok-on-the-disappearing-public-gaming-sector-the-game-kitchen-on-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-and-mor/">recent interview</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/digimon-story-time-stranger-producer-says-he-hopes-it-shows-players-the-difference-between-digimon-and-pokemon/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “Each has its own unique strengths. We believe that these differences will naturally become apparent as players experience this title.” He doesn’t go into detail about what those differences are, though they’ll be obvious to anyone who has played both <em>Time Stranger</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> this fall.</p> <p>He said <em>Time Stranger</em> is trying to be less insular than past Digimon games by easing players into the world. “Simply delving into the appeal of powerful Digimon like the Olympos XII would only resonate with existing Digimon fans, so we made sure to introduce several mysteries at the beginning of the narrative—designed to spark curiosity and encourage all players to move forward with interest,” Hara explaioned.</p>

 <h2><em>Splitgate 2</em> will re-launch next month</h2> <p>The portal shooter came and went in the blink of an eye earlier this year is headed back to a soft launch beta on December 4. CEO Ian Proulx is confident things will be different this time, and no, he wont’ be back at the Game Award <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">with a new hat</a>.</p> <p>“The thing that has me most optimistic is the results from the playtests,” he wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1p5pwa5/comment/nqm368w/">on Reddit</a>. “Even though the numbers aren’t crazy big, we have seen them grow every time both in terms of player count and in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our NPS score is the highest it has ever been by far (which basically in the survey measures how likely people are to recommend<em> Splitgate</em> to a friend). This has been our most important metric to improve, and we have done just that.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-sony-ps5-kojima-2000647534">The wait for <em>Death Stranding 2</em> on PC might not be as long as we think&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/another-long-time-game-studio-is-on-the-chopping-block-2000647684">Splash Damage faces studio-wide layoffs after a private equity buyout&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">EA explores AI that can upsell players on sports game card packs&nbsp;</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How big does a computer need to be? Custom PC towers can be enormous. Heck, we even call them “towers” after all to really call attention to how much space they take up. But do you really need that? I mean, our phones are pretty small and they can provide a shocking amount of processing power. Maybe a mini PC is all you need. You can save some cash going that route too. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">Take for instance this KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini PC. It’s normally priced affordably at just $230. However, right now it’s part of a limited time Black Friday deal taking the price down even further.</a> You’ll saving nearly 20%, paying only $190 for this tiny computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Can It Game?</h2>
<p>Now, is this a replacement for a custom-built PC tower? No. How do the graphics stack up against an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090? Like ass. Of course, this is not for those with unlimited budget trying to play<em> Grand Theft Auto VI</em> at the highest settings when it eventually (probably) releases on PC. This is the gaming PC for someone who has neither much cash nor space to spare who is looking to start a new file in <em>Stardew Valley</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>This is the gaming PC for those who want to be able to access&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> from every TV from every room in their house. It’s for running ROMs of all your favorite NES and SNES-era games (so long as you own the games outright. Emulation is naughty otherwise).</p>



<p>Let’s talk specs. What we’re actually working with is pretty surprising given the KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini’s size. This thing packs a 12th generation Alder Lake N95 processor capable of boosting up to a max of 3.4GHz. Memory-wise, we have 16GB of RAM. It’s got built-in storage in the form of its 512GB solid state drive. Plus, you can expand the storage up to 2TB with separately-purchased SSDs. It supports 4K graphics at 60Hz and with its two HDMI slots and VGA connector, you can feasibly display on up to three monitors at once.</p>
<p>The real show here is just how small this PC is. It measures in at roughly five by five inches long and wide. Comes in at two inches high. This little square computer can practically fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>In actuality, it’s unlikely this will be you end-all, be-all place to play games. Really this PC is designed for those who have basic computer needs like web browsing, word processing, and streaming TV shows, but it can do it in a tight form factor without taking up any space on your desk.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hellcase a Scam or Legit? Separating Facts from Myth]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hellcase/</link>
            <guid>1366630</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some people may wonder, “Is Hellcase a scam or legit?” The answer is clear: Hellcase is completely legit, as it not only offers fair and transparent terms of use, for example, its Provably Fair algorithms, but also has an excellent security system that prevents attackers from getting hold of any information about you or your account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real question isn’t “is Hellcase a legit site,” but “how do I spot the fake sites that impersonate Hellcase?”</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonating-scam-alerts"><strong>Hellcase Impersonating Scam Alerts</strong></h2>



<p>Users sometimes encounter information suggesting that Hellcase might be a scam. In reality, any large brand or website often faces this problem. Because of their popularity, they attract the attention of not only honest players but also scammers. The “Hellcase is a scam” myth you see online is almost always fueled by people who, unfortunately, got tricked by one of these fake sites.</p>



<p>Scammers often create various fraudulent methods to get hold of information. They create various bots, fake websites that may look similar to a Hellcase page, or anything else that can help them steal your personal or account information. These scammers are counting on you to be in a hurry. They want you to click a link from a fake email, a shady Discord message, or a random Steam friend without checking the address bar. Therefore, before entering any personal or account details, always double-check the website and be attentive to the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonators-on-steam"><strong>Hellcase impersonators on Steam</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to fake websites, scammers also frequently use Steam to deceive users. They often create lookalike accounts, using names such as “Hellcase Admin,” “Hellcase Support,” or “Hellcase Bot.” All of this can confuse users, and scammers exploit that trust to deceive them.</p>



<p>Their method is simple: they add players as friends or send a direct message, posing as employees. They might send you a link or directly ask for access to your account, often claiming it’s for security purposes. The message might mention fake winnings, payment issues, fraudulent transactions, or various other topics. However, remember that Hellcase never asks its customers for this type of information, nor does it communicate with them via Steam accounts. This is 100% of the time, always, a scam. So, stay vigilant and be careful.</p>



<p>How do you avoid this? It’s simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do not accept the friend request.</li>



<li>Do not click any links they send you.</li>



<li>Never give them any information.</li>



<li>Block the user.</li>



<li>Report the profile to Steam for impersonation.</li>
</ul>



<p>And remember: all official communication takes place EXCLUSIVELY through the support system on the official <a href="https://hellcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellcase</a> website.</p>



<h2 id="h-real-life-scenarios-of-scam-victims"><strong>Real-Life Scenarios of Scam Victims</strong></h2>



<p>Picture this: you’ve just finished a game, and as you’re closing Steam, you see a friend request from an account named “Hellcase_Moderator” or something similar, complete with the official Hellcase logo. Without suspecting anything, you add the account as a friend. A little while later, you get a message claiming you’ve won a giveaway. To get your skin, you just need to click a link.</p>



<p>After clicking the link, you land on a site that looks just like Hellcase. You enter your details, but nothing happens. When you go back to Steam and message the account to ask why it’s not working, you get no reply. That’s because the scammers created a phishing site to steal your data and, ultimately, your skins.</p>



<p>Let us be 100% clear: OUR STAFF WILL NEVER DM YOU ON STEAM. EVER.</p>



<p>This is one of the real cases that, unfortunately, happen to users simply due to inattention.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonator-scam-examples"><strong>Hellcase Impersonator Scam Examples</strong></h2>



<p>Scammers register dozens of domains hoping to catch you off guard. Here are just a few examples of fake, scammer-owned domains that are<strong> NOT Hellcase</strong>. If you see any of these, stay away:</p>



<ul>
<li>helfcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)com(.)de</li>



<li>Hellcases(.)site</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>



<li>hellcasc(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)shop</li>



<li>hellcase-es(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-cz(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-br(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-csgo(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-hu(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-fr(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-de(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-tr(.)com</li>



<li>heffcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcsee(.)com</li>



<li>cs2hellcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)space</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>
</ul>



<p>Look closely. They rely on typos, extra dashes, or different domain endings like .shop or .space instead of .com or .org.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-only-official-hellcase-websites"><strong>The Only Official Hellcase Websites</strong></h2>



<p>This is the most crucial part of this message, so please pay attention.</p>



<p>There are <strong>ONLY TWO</strong> official, legitimate, and safe Hellcase domains. They are:</p>



<ul>
<li>https://hellcase.com</li>



<li>https://hellcase.org</li>
</ul>



<p>You will also sometimes encounter hellcs2.com, which is also one of the official websites, but it is more often used for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>That’s it. No dashes. No extra letters. No “.shop,” “.space,” or “.de.”</p>



<p>Just .com and .org.</p>



<p>Please, before you log in, before you deposit, before you do anything, look at your browser’s address bar. If you’re ever asking yourself, “is Hellcase a legit site?”, the first thing you must do is check that URL. If you are on hellcase.com or hellcase.org, then yes, Hellcase is a legit site. If you are anywhere else, you are on a scam site.</p>



<p>Will you be using Hellcase? Let us know in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-over-100-on-the-14-in-1-160w-anker-prime-docking-station-with-black-friday-today-2000647671</link>
            <guid>1366603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161.</a> That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Connect and Charge</h2>
<p>The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.</p>
<p>Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.</p>



<p>You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/"> It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now.

            <p>The Game Awards are nearly here, your annual fix for celebrating the best this year had to offer and checking out cool reveals. However, while the show is sure to be packed with all sorts of exciting new trailers to gaze upon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will not be among them.</p>
<p>This harsh truth comes from none other than CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski, who took to X to express his pleasure at the upcoming RPG's presence on the Most Anticipated Games list, as well as snuff out hopes of a coinciding trailer.</p>
<p>Nowakowski wrote: "I'm very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot to us. We won't be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you."</p>

<p>Development on The Witcher 4 is well underway, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">with CD Projekt Red hiring new talent in recent months to maintain the charge to its eventual release</a>. We last saw the game in-action back in June, though while that demo may have <em>looked</em> like gameplay, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">actually a representation of what the tech could do and wasn't representative of the final game</a>, according to CD Projekt Red. That being said, the performance seen during that tech demo is what the game is aiming for, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">and it did show off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p><p>Even without The Witcher 4, The Game Awards is set to be a special one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has already broken records as the most nominated game of 2025</a>, and we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">had a withdrawal courtesy of Megabonk developer Vedinad</a>. It'll be well worth checking out next month.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails naval expansion had its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">release pushed back</a> from June 17th to November 26th. You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marauding-medieval-masses-mash-together-beneath-the-mainsail-in-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails">give it a go</a> right now if you fancy, so it obviously made that second date. Prior to the DLC dropping, I chatted with Bannerlord senior producer Falk Engel about what went into the decision to ditch the initial summer date, and why custom naval battles were <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">only confirmed</a> to be arriving with its launch quite late in the day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked whether the delay was down to specific issues which needed to be overcome, or just a general desire to spend more time polishing the massive overhaul up, Engel told me it was a "bit of both". There's always this technical challenge to optimise it as much as possible," he said. "Especially as you add more content and features, because everything that you add can also break stuff that you thought was already done with.</p>
<p>"Then on the other hand, there was a conscious conversation, conscious discussion that the title was not yet at the level of quality and the amount of content and features that we wanted. So, it was just the sensible choice for us to take additional time and that time as well allowed us to push out the base game changes for player feedback and react to that player feedback."</p>
<p>So, Taleworlds spent time refining War Sails and patch v1.3.4, as well as answering questions from players in regular developer blog posts to keep interest in the DLC boiling away. In the <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">fourth of these posts</a>, the team answered a question about whether War Sails would include custom naval battles - standalone fights players can set up to their liking from the main menu in the base game - at launch. Surprise: the post revealed, following previous feedback, that those custom ship battles would be coming at launch.</p><p>When I asked Engel what went into the original decision not to have these custom naval battles right away, and how those plans changed, he conceded that it's a "bit more of a technical question", so he'd need to go out on a limb. "The way that I understand it, our custom battle is a separate module from sandbox, from campaign, etc," he explained. "With the way that we've set up our base game, it can function like that. The way that the DLC is set up, the ships and so forth are set up, it’s more complex to access the relevant elements of the game. One of the things that I believe we still don't have in naval custom battles, for example, are the [ship] figureheads. That is because of this sort of modular or module approach to different elements of the game."</p>
<p>He added that, natually, this modular approach is a boon for modding, revealing that "essentially, War Sails is a large mod". While he didn't get into specifics, Engel did add that developing War Sails has "resulted in changes to the way that modding is supported", which have had a "positive impact" overall.</p>
<p>As someone who's always a bit more comfortable watching an assault I know won't leave me having to lick my wounds and start rebuilding my army from scratch after a few painful nights in chains, I'm certainly glad Taleworlds were able to make custom battles work from the get-go. Plus, they're an ideal way of trying the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-designer-on-ships-that-mimic-horse-archers-and-dredging-for-inspiration-in-french-bogs">fleet of historically-inspired vessels</a> before you commit to investing the considerable coin to buy one in a full campaign.</p>
