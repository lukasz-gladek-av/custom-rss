<figure data-uuid="6ee639dfecc91"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners In Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ee639dfecc91/mario-and-luigi-partners-in-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many years, it felt like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_and_luigi_partners_in_time">Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a> was the redheaded stepchild of the Mario &amp; Luigi series. People criticised it for its more linear structure, overly long boss battles (at least in the US version), having to purchase items to use Bros. Attacks, and slightly cumbersome gameplay, among other areas.</p>
<p>Being released between the two most critically acclaimed games in the series certainly didn't help. It even got skipped over for the remake treatment, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga_plus_bowsers_minions">+ Bowser's Minions</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_and_luigi_bowsers_inside_story">Bowser's Inside Story</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_bowsers_inside_story_plus_bowser_jr_s_journey">+ Bowser Jr.'s Journey</a>). Even if it may not reach the lofty heights of those two, I’d argue Partners in Time is still a fine game in its own right—and even more so two decades later, in light of subsequent entries.</p>
<div><p>The game’s titular time travel shenanigans begin pretty much from the outset. Professor E. Gadd has invented a time machine, and Princess Peach wants to be the first to test it. In a twist that surprises virtually no one, upon the time machine’s return from the past, the Princess is nowhere to be seen. Now, time holes are popping up all over Peach’s castle, and it’s up to Mario and Luigi to race to the past and find her. But that’s not all. They’ll also need to recover the shattered pieces of the Cobalt Star, a Macguffin said to be able to repair the rift in spacetime.</p><p>

Oh yeah, and did I mention the Mushroom Kingdom of the past is also under invasion by the Shroobs, a race of monstrous, mushroom-like aliens? Even today, these guys rank among the most ruthless villains in Mario’s roster.</p></div>
<figure data-uuid="2cb9631eaad01"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2cb9631eaad01/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A great start, but PiT is up there with it — <em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to having no qualms with levelling entire cities, they revel in sucking out the life force of their victims, turning it into energy to power their flying saucers. Said victims get better—this is a Mario game, after all—but arriving in the past only to be greeted by lifeless Toads among the ruins of their ravaged town sets a sombre tone and cements the Shroobs as opponents Mario and Luigi do <em>not</em> want to take lightly. The game’s generally darker tone among <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-rpgs-of-all-time">Mario RPGs</a> remains widely celebrated among fans.</p>
<p>Mario and Luigi have their hands full, but thankfully, they’re not alone on their quest. Their baby selves are caught up in the Shroob invasion as well, and they immediately show they’re more than capable heroes, even at such a young age. You also encounter younger versions of series staples like Princess Peach, Professor Gadd, Bowser, and even Toadsworth, who, for the first and thus far <em>only</em> time ever in a Mario game, is actually useful for something.</p>
<p>The time travel element allowed developers AlphaDream to utilise Mario lore in unique ways, unlike any other in franchise history. Of course, we’ve seen baby versions of the Mario crew before, but now we really get to see their characters shine. Baby Mario and Luigi, in particular, could easily have been <em>monumentally</em> annoying. It wouldn’t be without precedent, considering how ear-grating Baby Mario was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi’s Island</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, they hold their own right alongside their adult counterparts, providing the occasional comic relief without drifting into the realm of burdensome. If you don’t get the warm fuzzies seeing Mario and Luigi coddle and play with them—their antics punctuated by delightfully squeaky sound bites by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-charles-martinet-made-gamings-greatest-accident-a-real-character">Charles Martinet</a>—you might want to check and see if a Shroob has drained <em>your</em> life force.</p>

<p>The addition of the DS' 'X' and 'Y' buttons to the standard two-button Mario and Luigi formula was another calculated risk, but the gameplay is intuitive and easy to pick up, even for less nimble players like myself. Control Mario and Luigi with 'A' and 'B', and their younger counterparts with 'X' and 'Y'. Overworld traversal is a joy with a wide variety of incredibly creative moves, both new and returning. My personal favourite is the aptly-named Baby Cakes, in which Mario and Luigi roll up into a ball and flatten their baby selves like pancakes, allowing them to fit into tight spaces (no, it’s not baby abuse; they like it!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider brevity to be one of Partners in Time’s greatest strengths [...] compared to later titles that are twice as long yet somehow contain no more plot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the game’s turn-based battles that really put this new four-button system to the test. Mario and Luigi are the main attackers and defenders, with the babies acting as backup. In a design choice unique to this game, your Bros. Attacks are consumable items.</p>
<p>I’ll readily admit this change does strip away a layer of strategy to battles, though I personally enjoy not having to stress about regularly replenishing my Bros. Points to restore my abilities. While Superstar Saga’s Bros. Attacks were all basically glorified jump and hammer combos, this game introduces the flashier moves the series is known for, such as Koopa Shells you ricochet off enemies, Fire Flowers that let you pelt enemies with fireballs, and Trampolines enabling potentially endless jump attacks.</p>
<p>As you unlock new attacks, they become increasingly fun and satisfying to pull off. Some, such as the Red Shell and Copy Flower, have no cap, meaning the attack will continue, increasing in speed, until you miss a button input. With fast enough reflexes, you can wipe out many of the game’s bosses in only a handful of turns.</p>

<p>This alleviates what I feel is one of the unwarranted criticisms: bosses having too much HP. Fan outcry was so prevalent that, in the European and Japanese versions of the game, boss HP was significantly reduced. As a US-based gamer who owns the original version, I can say that, aside from the final boss, not one of them took me more than several minutes to defeat, especially later when you gain access to moves that can easily rack up 400-plus damage per turn. I’ve spent more time dodging overly drawn-out enemy attacks in later games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_dream_team">Dream Team</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Brothership</a>, where it feels like the developers prioritised excessive spectacle over crafting well-balanced fights that respect the player’s time.</p>
<p>In fact, I consider brevity to be one of Partners in Time’s greatest strengths. A playthrough typically clocks in at a respectable 18 or so hours, compared to later titles that are twice as long yet somehow contain no more plot.</p>
<p>Partners in Time is about as streamlined a Mario and Luigi experience as you can get. The plot moves at a refreshingly brisk pace, telling the story it wants to tell without succumbing to the excessive bloat of later entries. It forgoes side quests and exploration in favour of linear, more self-contained hub worlds—a valid point of contention, but one I feel can be argued further enhances the game’s tightened focus on story and gameplay.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-and-luigi-partners-in-time/">On Metacritic</a>, Partners in Time remains the third-highest-rated game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-rpgs-of-all-time">Nintendo Life's Mario RPG list</a>, too (without factoring in remakes), cementing its continued status as an overlooked gem. It may not have as rich a world as Superstar Saga or reach the epic highs of Bowser’s Inside Story, but looking at it two decades and several hit-and-miss Mario &amp; Luigi games later, I still rank Partners in Time up there with the series’ best.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-tightest-briskest-mario-and-luigi-game-turns-20-today-and-deserves-more-love]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It feels like I’ve spent most of this week playing the game ‘avoiding the Christmas crowds’, but I did get to enjoy my own version of Thanksgiving where I just watched NFL for six hours, and didn’t have to think about turkey for another month. In terms of gaming, I’ve been playing a truckload of Octopath Traveler 0, as well as some more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Tomb Raider Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Besides that, I’ve been checking out Assetto Corsa Rally, and messing with GeForce Now across a bunch of platforms to see how it performs.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/sweet-surrender-review/">Sweet Surrender</a> for review, as well as Halls of Torment and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Bizarrely keen to try and take on the Marvel Rivals PlayStation Cup challenge next week, <strong>Ade</strong> has been practicing by polished off his review of the retro-styled scrolling beat ’em up Marvel Cosmic Invasion. The embargo for that is on Monday, so check out his review then!</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has had a much quieter week. After flitting between a glut of new multiplayer games, he’s back to Ghost of Yotei as he focuses on finishing the main quest.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Duskpunk for review, which is a mix of Citizen Sleeper meets the rough life in a town full of opportunities and misfortune. Sounds great to me!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing the natural pairing of Terrifier: the Artcade game and Spongebob Square pants: Titans of the Tide. This weird gaming concoction has had mixed results, with Steve telling us, “The first was unfortunately pretty rubbish but the second is a solid, albeit short, 3D platformer” He continued, “With those wrapped, I’ve moved onto an indie space horror that’s been years in the making and is wonderfully atmospheric.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been curling himself up into a ball for an upcoming review, while also dabbling with some upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide DLC, and dipping into some cheap Black Friday sale pick ups, like Loop Hero.</p>
<p>And what about you? Have you played anything this week? Why not tell us about it!</p>

			<p>The most significant announcement made at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>. The massively successful open world racing franchise is returning next year to PC and Xbox consoles, featuring the long-coveted Japan setting.</p>



<p>When is it launching, though? Looking back at previous franchise entries, every Forza Horizon game has been released so far between September and November. However, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1994108555780297089#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider Nate the Hate</a>, that trend might change with Forza Horizon 6, because UK developer Playground Games is targeting a launch at some point in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The Fall launch window has worked wonders so far for the franchise. The most recent game, Forza Horizon 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached over 40 million players as of July 2024</a> and has since grown further, thanks to its launch on the PlayStation 5 console, where the title even <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsold Sony's own first-party games for a while</a>.</p>



<p>However, 2026 is definitely a peculiar situation given that the release of the proverbial elephant in the room, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, has been postponed from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Quite literally every triple-A game developer (and most indie ones, too) will want to distance their games as much as possible from that all-consuming void. Sure, Forza Horizon 6 belongs to a different enough genre, but why risk it? Of course, that all hinges on the game being ready to launch by then. </p>



<p>If the game is released in the first half of 2026, it will have been four and a half years since FH5, by far the longest gap between releases in the franchise. Playground Games may actually launch two games next year, given that their other big gamble, Fable, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed from 2025 to a generic 2026 window</a>. Fable might be released toward the end of next year (provided there isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay into 2027</a>).</p>



<p>The developers have yet to reveal many details about Forza Horizon 6, although we already know the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The map is designed around three key regions: the dense city of Tokyo, coastal areas, and mountain tōge roads. Playground Games is focusing less on raw size and more on density and verticality, especially in Tokyo, utilizing layered, multi-level roads inspired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-expansion-launches-on-july-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels expansion</a>.​</li>



<li>Map design emphasizes tight city streets, multi-story highways, mountain passes, and rural rice-field backroads, providing a diverse range of driving experiences within one map that include typically Japanese car races, such as urban street racing, mountain drifting, and high‑speed coastal runs.</li>



<li>The campaign progression harkens back to Forza Horizon 1's structure, where players start with slower cars and earn their way up, with faster tiers unlocking as they progress rather than being showered on them from the get-go.</li>



<li>The car roster in Forza Horizon 6 will be heavily expanded with Japanese flavor, including kei cars and kei vans, which appear both as drivable garage vehicles and AI traffic.</li>



<li>The open world will '<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blow fans away</a>', between the inherent beauty of Japanese environments and the tech improvements made to the engine.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the game has only been announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X, a PlayStation 5 version is inevitable given the success encountered by its predecessor. The only question is whether it will be released later in 2026 or in 2027, but we'll keep you up to date on those rumors and news as soon as they become available.</p>

            <p>Pre-release builds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> recently unearthed at a shop in Utah contain rare files which could be "incredibly useful" to expanding what modders can do with the RPG. Well, at least they doe in the estimation of the folks who claim to have found them, a group of preservationists whose current online presence only looks to have popped up last month.</p>

<p>According to the group, who go by Games' Past, they picked up these builds by buying some dev-kits which had been sitting around on a shelf for a year. They cite the betas contained in the kits as being from July 21st and August 22nd, 2010, with some bits of a build from April that year also having been found. For reference, New Vegas came out in October 2010.</p>
<p>The video mainly focuses on the July build, showing off a bunch of cut content it includes. Some of this stuff, like Mr House's robo-girlfriend Marilyn, has previously been <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72209">unearthed and restored</a> by modders, but other bits don't immediately come up if you search 'cut content' on New Vegas' Nexus Mods page.</p><p>There's an encounter with a wasteland adventurer who spoils the fun right after you leave Goodsprings by telling you in no uncertain terms that heading north through Quarry Junction's a bad idea, a less annoyingly-voiced Oliver Swanick, and an early version of Mr House's screen which makes him look a lot more like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> character. The video also flips between versions of the game, showing off some minor differences in how certain locations look.</p>
<p>Cool, but things get more interesting later in the video, when its narrator Ventura claims the builds could play a key role in helping expand what's possible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">current day New Vegas modding</a>. "All three builds came with intact PDBs (program database files), which have never been leaked before for any version of Fallout New Vegas, or for any game before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> for that matter," they asserted. "For those who aren't aware, the PDB file is an extremely important file to modders, as it is a file generated while the game is being built that contains much additional debugging information, which is incredibly useful for reverse engineering the game and understanding not only how the game functions, but the engine behind it as well."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that comes to pass, but unless they've previously gone by a different name, this looks to be the first act of publicly visible preservation Games' Past have done. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamesPastOrg">YouTube channel</a> only hosts this one video, while both it and their <a href="https://x.com/GamesPastOrg">Twitter account</a> were only created in October 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it does make me a bit more hesitant to immediately trust their modding assertions than I would be if they were an established organisation with a visibly substantial track record for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like the wastelander who's keen not to see you become Deathclaw food, time'll prove I'm just being a bit too cautious.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-christmas-tree-hit-80k-sales-this-black-friday-festive-set-now-goes-for-peanuts-2000648384</link>
            <guid>1367212</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas approaches rapidly and LEGO rushes to clear remaining holiday inventory before the season passes and these seasonal sets lose immediate relevance. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">Christmas tree set just dropped to $25 from $44, hitting a record-low 44% discount for Black Friday</a> on Amazon. If you want a compact Christmas tree that survives annual storage cycles without shedding needles, wilting branches or requiring disposal after the holidays, this is a great investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2-in-1 Design</h2>
<p>The set lets you build either <strong>one big Christmas tree display or two smaller mini trees</strong>, depending on how much space you have and what you like to decorate with. The <strong>bigger version is more than 11 inches tall</strong> and makes it a great choice for mantel displays, dining table centerpieces, or office desk decorations that really stand out. The dual mini tree option makes one 9-inch tree and one 6-inch tree. This lets you display them together with other decorations or spread holiday cheer throughout several rooms.</p>



<p>Each type of tree has <strong>intricate decorations, candles, and yellow star toppers</strong> that give LEGO’s unique blocky style a classic Christmas tree look. The ornaments use colored round pieces that look like glass baubles, and the candles use special pieces to make shapes that are easy to recognize, even though LEGO’s shapes are limited. <strong>The yellow star on top of each tree</strong> is made in the same five-pointed way that every Christmas tree needs, which gives it a classic look.</p>
<p>Building things is a fun activity that can be done alone or with family during the holidays when relatives want to do more than just eat and talk, and kids 12 and older can build things on their own using clear, illustrated instructions. The moderate number of pieces and easy-to-follow assembly instructions <strong>make it possible to finish in 1 to 2 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>The small size works in places where full-size trees don’t work like apartments, dorm rooms, office cubicles, or homes with aggressive pets and curious toddlers, where regular trees can be dangerous. Put them on desks without taking up too much space, on mantels next to other decorations without crowding, or on dining tables as centerpieces that spark conversation.</p>
<p>The <strong>gift potential is broad because it appeals to a wide range of people</strong>. Connecting kids, teens and adults who love LEGO and like to build complicated things that look like holiday decorations. Kids get fun building projects that last, teens like Instagram-worthy decor to make their dorm rooms feel more like home, and adults know that quality home accents are worth showing off all year long, not just during the holidays.</p>
<p>The aggressive 44% Black Friday discount from $44 to $25 makes LEGO’s Christmas tree set cost less than many holiday decorations that can only be used once and then thrown away. If you want Christmas decorations that will last for decades and provide fun and conversation, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-osmo-pocket-3-creator-combo-2000648172</link>
            <guid>1367209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vlogging cameras, especially those offering incredible stability and quality video, both day and night, usually sit well over $800. DJI makes some of our favorite vlogging and action cameras out there, and all thanks to Black Friday, picking up one today doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/">We just spotted the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 creator combo going for $669 on Amazon right now.</a> It typically sits around $979, so you can save more than $300 on it if you act right now. The deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’ve got the Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable, High-Quality Footage</h2>
<p>It’s a tiny, travel-friendly vlogging that fits in your palm and slips into your pocket for easy portability. Superior stability comes from Pocket 3’s advanced 3-axis mechanical stabilization, while ActiveTrack 6.0 keeps you in focus at all times. Trying out a new dance move or chasing a furry friend around, you can bid shaky, headache-inducing footage goodbye. The camera even locks onto your subject, which can come in handy when filming some action-packed sequences.</p>
<p>The built-in 2-inch full-color OLED rotatable touchscreen moves both horizontally and vertically to give you the perfect shots. When it comes to picture quality, the camera records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps. There’s a 1-inch CMOS sensor to capture clear highlight-shadow details, meaning you will be able to show the world what you’ve been up to even after the shadows fall. It’s smart enough to fine-tune exposure for different skin tones on its own, giving you a glow like never before. Pair this with background bokeh that makes the subject stand out, and you’ll have stunning, professional videos ready to be uploaded on YouTube right away. Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the camera to live stream on different platforms, and even use it for online meetings as a webcam. Basically, it takes care of all your video needs, both personal and professional, like a pro.</p>



<p>Sound quality is another strong selling point. Pocket 3 actively reduces background noise to capture what you’re saying clearly, even in noisy, chaotic settings. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair the camera with a compatible DJI microphone for a more premium experience.</p>
<p>Battery life is impeccable. A single charge lets you film in 1090p/24fps for over 2.5 hours; perfect for longer journeys where you want to take your online family along. Recharging won’t take long either, as Pocket 3 hits 80% in just 16 minutes. Best of all, tweaking settings and editing the content won’t be a hassle, thanks to the dedicated smartphone app. The platform lets you play around with filters, plus convert 3-second videos into photos on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Osmo Pocket 3 starting set, the DJI Mic 2 Transmitter, battery handle, Osmo mini Tripod, and more. The battery charger, however, is sold separately. All things considered, if you’ve been on the lookout for a portable camera that makes it easy to record your adventures and share your everyday life with the world, the Pocket 3 Creator Combo is an excellent option to consider.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/"> On a regular day, it would run you around $979, but this rare Black Friday deal drops the price to just $669</a>. We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s definitely going to pay for itself in the long run. Just be sure to get your orders in quick, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads All Flagship Phones This Black Friday, Including OnePlus 13 Now at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-all-flagship-phones-this-black-friday-including-oneplus-13-now-at-new-record-low-2000648375</link>
            <guid>1367182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday’s main day arrives with Amazon delivering massive discounts across every product category to maximize shopper satisfaction. iPhone 17 models are still absent from Amazon’s catalog but flagship Android devices receive substantial markdowns <strong>including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Google Pixel 10, and OnePlus 13</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/">OnePlus 13 costs $799 in its 512GB configuration during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $999</a> and hits a record-low price that explains its bestseller status. The 20% discount makes flagship specs (including Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 6,000mAh battery, 120Hz QHD+ display and Hasselblad camera system) accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier phones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon 8 Elite Performance That Rules</h2>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the <strong>best Android mobile silicon out there</strong>. It has maximum clock speeds of 4.32GHz and is made using cutting-edge 3nm technology which gives it desktop-level performance, and it can handle demanding games at their highest settings, professional photo and video editing, and extreme multitasking across dozens of apps without the slowdowns that happen with less powerful processors.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.82-inch ProXDR display has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels</strong> and an <strong>adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> that smoothly switches between 1Hz for static content and 120Hz for scrolling or gaming. The LTPO technology makes this variable refresh possible while also making the battery last longer by automatically adjusting based on the type of content, and the ProXDR name means that the screen is brighter with a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits for HDR content.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision support makes video from Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ look amazing by giving it a lot of contrast. The 10-bit color depth shows over 1 billion colors, so there are no banding issues with smooth gradients, and the display is just as good for work as it is for play with clear text and detailed spreadsheets, bright colors, and deep blacks.</p>
<p>The huge <strong>6,000mAh battery is one of the biggest in flagship phones and really lasts for two days of normal use</strong>, not just the optimistic marketing claims that say you need to use airplane mode and not much else. Heavy users who stream video, play games and use apps all the time can go full days without worrying about their batteries dying. Moderate users can go two evenings before needing to charge their phones. The <strong>80W SuperVOOC wired charging fully charges the battery in about 35 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to wait until the next day to charge it. Instead, you can charge it during your lunch break or morning routine. The 50W AirVOOC wireless charging is as fast as many wired charging options and lets you charge your phone at your desk or nightstand without having to deal with cords in the dark.</p>



<p>The<strong> fifth-generation Hasselblad camera system has three cameras with 50MP sensors on the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses,</strong> and gives you a lot of options for shooting. The main sensor captures incredible detail thanks to its large 1/1.4-inch size, which lets in more light than smaller sensors in other phones. This makes it work better in low light and gives it a shallower depth of field.</p>
<p>The ultra-wide lens handles wide-open spaces with little edge distortion, and the telephoto lens lets you zoom in on things that are far away without losing quality, which is a problem with phones that only crop. <strong>Hasselblad’s color science makes pictures that look real</strong> with accurate skin tones and balanced saturation, instead of the over-processed look that phones that try to look good on social media have.</p>
<p>OnePlus’s<strong> custom interface for Android 15 with OxygenOS</strong> combines the clean look of stock Android with useful features like gesture navigation, gaming mode, and a wide range of theme options. The interface stays fast and responsive because it doesn’t have much bloatware and manages resources well, which keeps it from slowing down like heavily skinned Android versions do. OnePlus promises to give the phone four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches.</p>
<p>The 512GB model is on sale for a record-low price of $799 on Black Friday, down from the usual price of $999. This makes OnePlus’s flagship specs competitive with mid-range phones that cost about the same but have much better performance, display quality, battery life, and camera capabilities.</p>

            <p>
These days, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> is perhaps best known for its wonderful work on last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, but the studio's horror oeuvre goes much farther back. And it's bringing its first big hit - and its ship-bound sequel - to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> very soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>: The Final Masterpiece Edition comes to Nintendo's platform on 19th December.
</p>
<p>
Announced back in October, Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is a version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-remake-launching-15th-june-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Bloober's 2023 Layers of Fear remake</a>, with a few added extras thrown in. The remake, if you're unfamiliar, was a bit of an unusual proposition, taking both Layers of Fear games (plus new story bits and old DLC) and weaving them together into a single, interlinking narrative.

<p>
That means you got Layers of Fear 1 and its surreal first-person horror trip through the ever-shifting mansion of a tortured painter; its Inheritance DLC and a brand-new chapter featuring the painter's wife; its 2018 sequel - inspired by the golden age of Hollywood - which followed a brand-new protagonist on an avant-garde journey through the innards of an ocean liner and their troubled past, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together. All with enhanced visuals and new gameplay elements, including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors.
</p><p>
Switch 2's The Final Masterpiece Edition includes all the above, plus the remake's Final Prologue chapter which originally released as post-launch DLC. It also promises HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, alongside support for touchscreen and motion controls. It's a whole lot of Layers of Fear, in other words - which is fine by me. The series might be a little rough around the edges compared to Bloober's more recent stuff, but I'm a sucker for any game that goes all-in on the sheer hallucinatory spectacle - and Layers of Fear's ever-shifting spaces make for a wonderfully disorientating, gleefully surreal time.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Meta launched a second generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses with incremental improvements but the original model remains compelling through proven functionality and dramatically lower pricing. The <strong>Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta featuring 12MP camera, open-ear speakers, and AI assistant integration</strong> delivers the core smart glasses experience without the premium that newest hardware commands.</p>
<p>The price gap tells the story clearly: Gen 2 models cost $410 while these <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/">Gen 1 Wayfarers hit $262 during Black Friday on Amazon (down from $329) which is roughly 40% savings for hardware</a> that differs minimally in daily use. <strong>All coloris and frame styles</strong> receive identical discounting and the<strong> #1 bestseller status in tech glasses</strong> validates that buyers love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>12MP Camera That Shows Different Angles</h2>
<p>With the built-in 12MP camera, <strong>you can take pictures and videos hands-free from your exact point of view</strong>: This makes content that smartphones can’t make without awkward arm extensions or obvious filming. Parents keep track of their kids’ soccer games, recitals, and everyday moments by looking them in the eye and being present instead of watching through phone screens. Perspective shots that show what you really saw instead of what cameras picked up from hand-held positions that were slightly off from your line of sight make travel photography more real.</p>



<p><strong>Video recording can last up to 60 seconds per clip in 1080p resolution</strong>, and this is long enough to capture important moments without using too much storage space or battery life that would come with unlimited recording. Birthday cake presentations, scenic overlooks, and quick tutorials all fit easily into the 60-second window. This limit encourages people to film on purpose instead of filming for hours and hours and hours of footage that needs to be edited. The Meta View app automatically syncs the captured content to your phone, keeping everything organized without the need for manual file management or card readers.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ear speakers send sound</strong> in a way that only you can hear at normal volumes: This lets you listen privately without the isolation or discomfort that comes with wearing earbuds for a long time. You can still hear podcast episodes, directions, phone calls, and music while being aware of conversations, traffic, and other sounds that are important for safety. <strong>This technology is great for walking, biking, or any situation where complete audio isolation could be dangerous</strong> or lead to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Meta’s software lets <strong>you use voice commands to control photos, calls, messages, and information queries</strong> without having to touch your phone. You can ask the glasses to take a picture, make a call, send a message, or answer factual questions by speaking naturally, which is easier than trying to use your phone. The hands-free feature is useful when cooking, working out, or doing anything else where it’s hard or impossible to reach your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-Ban’s classic look is kept with the iconic Wayfarer style</strong> which is better than the obvious tech-forward designs that scream “smart glasses” and cause problems in social situations. The matte black frames and polarized gradient graphite lenses make these look like high-end sunglasses first and wearable technology second. This means they can be worn in both professional and social settings where tech that stands out is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>The battery lasts through full days of moderate use</strong> which includes taking a few photos, making a few videos, streaming music, and making calls without having to charge it in the middle of the day. The charging case that comes with it lets you charge it more than once on trips that last more than one day when there aren’t many wall outlets available.</p>
<p>There is a $148 difference between the Gen 1 models, which cost $262, and the Gen 2 models, which cost $410, and most users won’t even notice the improvements in their normal use. This record-low price makes smart glasses available without the usual trade-offs or extra costs for early adopters.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a> won't be receiving a second expansion to follow Claws of Awaji, unlike previous games in the series. Instead, Ubisoft is working on "chunkier updates", similar in size to the Attack on Titan crossover released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Since the launch of 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, releasing at least two expansions has become the norm for the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was even originally planned as a further expansion to Valhalla, before becoming a standalone game.</p>
<p>Yet that won't be the case with Shadows, released earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-release-date-announced-new-game-plus-coming-next-week">Claws of Awaji was released back in September</a>, but that will be the only expansion for the game.</p>

<p>"As of now, at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of [Claws of Awaji] that is planned, currently," said associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/5Iijrbz8XBc">JorRaptor</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years."</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois did admit the situation could change, but for now Ubisoft's plan is to keep updates "small and reactive and see how the community feels about it".</p>
<p>He continued: "We're trying to re-adjust for Year Two a little bit. There's learning from Year One that we can apply to Year Two. Any content we want to do in Year Two is probably going to be more sparse, so not a drip-feed like you said but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point but the strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often. For Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more about what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back to it and enjoy it."</p>
<p>Since its release, Shadows has already received a number of updates with fan-requested features, addressing the "fires" Lemay-Comtois mentioned. Now, the team is free to add more sizable updates, just not at the size of a full expansion.</p>
<p>Instead, those updates will be "something like yesterday's update plus, something at minimum this size".</p>
<p>That would be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-lands-unexpected-crossover-with-anime-attack-on-titan-but-its-only-available-for-one-month">Attack on Titan crossover added earlier this week</a>, though it's only available for a limited time. Still, the reaction online to this addition hasn't been overly positive, with <a href="https://x.com/NikTek/status/1994083060103696842?s=20">posts on social media</a> noting poor quest design and animations.</p>
<p>The game will soon arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Ubisoft yesterday detailing its features</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">received a surprise free story DLC recently</a>, reportedly backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has been out for a little over a week now, and our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAp4jrKkp9w">Digital Foundry</a> have been busy diving into the nitty-gritty to deliver a technical analysis of the pink puffball's latest adventure.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF states that Air Riders "nails" the fundamentals, with super fun racing, <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> vibes, and super detailed new tracks.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the lighting is the game's first win, utilising Nvidia's RTXGI to light dynamic objects and keep the characters looking super smooth. Sure, this pushes ray-traced lighting to the side in favour of more simplistic light maps, but the entire performance benefits as a consequence. The finer details might not be the finest you've ever seen if you stop and look at them in isolation, but, as Digital Foundry repeatedly points out, Air Riders isn't a game where you'll be doing a lot of stopping.</p>
<p>Engine-wise, the game runs in a new 'SOL-AVES' engine. While DF notes that we'll likely see far more impressive uses of it in the future, the engine produces something visually unique with a strong performance — not a bad start, then!</p>
<p>Onto resolution, and it seems that Air Riders is <em>mostly</em> running at 1080p in docked mode, with some shots occasionally going north of that — particularly in Top Ride mode, where you may be looking at 1440p. In handheld, DF found that things often sat at 900p, but they registered anything from 720p-1080p.</p>
<p>HDR implementation, on the flip side, is "exceptionally bad", with only the machines' particle effects seeming to make the most of the increased brightness. Everything else appears "washed out and dim" when using HDR, resulting in something that ends up looking "unnatural and borderline broken". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, performance fares much better. While there is no 120Hz option, the game delivers a "pretty much stable" 60fps, only occasionally dropping the odd frame (somewhat more frequently in City Trial mode). Three and four-player split screen aims for 60, but often ends up slightly lower, with City Trial, again, being the worst-hit mode at between 40-50fps — so, very admirable, but not quite there.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">our review</a>, we called Kirby Air Riders "a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards". You'll find our full thoughts, as well as those from Digital Foundry's shiny new site, by following the links below.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-2000647084</link>
            <guid>1367149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>

It's turned into this kind of cultural moment, phenomenon, but that's just because the game is very honest, I think. And a lot of people have bought into that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think anyone expected this because it's a small game.

This, it's stated, is the same group responsible for all of Remedy's other trademarks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious conclusion here is that Control: Resonant will be the title of Remedy's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control sequel</a>, which the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-announces-control-2-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-and-pc">developer first announced for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2022</a>. Little else is known about the project, however. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of the trademark's filing raises eyebrows, coming exactly two weeks before this year's The Game Awards broadcast on December 11. And Remedy has gone big at the show before, with a full dance number during the show's 2023 ceremony to celebrate Alan Wake 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there's a possibility this isn't the Control sequel that fans are waiting patiently for. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Remedy also has ideas for film and TV adaptations cooking</a> in collaboration with Annapurna Interactive, or this could alternatively be some other kind of spin-off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the sense among fans is that now is the right time for Control's full sequel to be revealed, two years after Remedy's last blockbuster game project arrived, and as a statement of intent following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-fbc-firebreak-underperformed-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied">disappointing performance of FBC: Firebreak</a>, the studio's scrappy attempt at a Control multiplayer experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Remedy for more, and will of course be reporting all the announcements from The Game Awards 2025 live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

			<p>As a known lover of card games, it wasn’t especially surprising that Cross Blitz really appealed to me back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/29/cross-blitz-early-access-review-hearthstone-with-the-heart-of-a-lion/">when I first tried its Early Access launch</a>. Two whole years later, does it still feel as good now that it’s fully released? To put it simply, yes.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all busy people, I’m not going to lead you on, so if that’s all you wanted to know, then you’re done here, but do feel free to leave the page open for a few minutes to help our metrics, and maybe open a couple of other articles too. Thanks!</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an RPG deckbuilder with multiple modes and multiple stories to play through as campaigns, thanks to its cast of different characters. Each of these characters have their own starting decks, and different potential build options as you progress as well. You’re bound to find a character or two you love the most, but at the end of the day, I think they’re all very well-designed and a lot of fun. It’s incredibly cool to nip around maps getting not only upgrades, but also more story about them all as well.</p>


<p>Along with that though, there’s also a roguelike mode, and it’s what can give Cross Blitz a near unlimited lifespan, whether you’ve finished the stories and find yourself wanting a bit more, or just want to snack on the gameplay and aren’t in the mood for reading. Yes, reading is very good for all of us, but some of us get four hours sleep, work too much, and just wanna demolish some enemies, you know?</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t quite hit me in with the Early Access release is just how much Cross Blitz feels like a really polished Game Boy Advance game. I think it’s the visual style mostly, but the whole vibe could easily have been from 20 years ago, and I mean that as a truly gargantuan compliment. Cross Blitz just feels like it’s laser-focused on its core gameplay and deck-building, doing a lot without wasting excess tech on stuff it doesn’t need. It masters mechanics to allow you to min-max, and it wants you to do so to push through some of the hardest battles as well.</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an even better game now as it has even more to do, which is usually how these things go. The full release brings with it a new story campaign, which is in a similar vein to what’s come before, and it remains a lot of fun. The result is a more complete experience with even more cards and mechanics to mes around with, and just so much variety. It feels like you’re getting into the weeds with a really good TCG, but you don’t need to pay for all of it.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cross Blitz is a beautifully made deck builder that feels not only incredibly inventive, but also mechanically dense, and just very satisfying to sink into. On top of that, the looks are exceptionally charming, the music is good, and the vibes are just on point. If you love a good deckbuilder, then you’ll love this, but the campaign modes also mean that this could be the one that grabs you if you’ve only ever bounced off of others due to the roguelike focus.	</p></div>

            <p>The Let it Die sequel - Let it Die: Inferno - which is coming out next week (4th December), seems to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the somewhat surprising sequel to Suda51 studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">Grasshopper's quirky 2016 action game Let it Die</a>, which mixed action and base infiltration and asymmetric multiplayer to novel effect. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battle-royale-deathverse-let-it-die-dev-to-temporarily-suspend-the-game-just-four-months-after-launch">a purely multiplayer follow-up called Deathverse, which flopped</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/">The Let it Die: Inferno Steam page</a> now discloses: "AI-generated content has been used and then edited by our team for certain parts of the in-game voices, music, and graphics." This content apparently includes background signboard textures, records illustrations, infocast videos and voices and music.</p>
<p>To what degree each of those parts of the game uses AI, we don't know, but the areas outlined - art, video, voice and music - are large areas, so the game's AI use could be substantial.</p>

<p>Inferno was only announced to the world a couple of months ago, during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">a September PlayStation State of Play</a>, so it hasn't had much of a marketing campaign. Perhaps that suggests a project sped to release, which is, of course, something AI could help achieve.</p>
<p>Grasshopper isn't involved with the sequel, which is entirely developed by Supertrick Games, co-developer of the original game. And the core of the game has shifted slightly to PvEvP, meaning real-time multiplayer will be a thing here.</p>
<p>Were it not for Steam's AI disclosure policy, we likely wouldn't have known about AI use in Inferno until people bought and played it, and noticed it, and reports spread around. In that regard, it's a helpful tool for shoppers, should they care. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">there are people who think AI disclosures aren't necessary, such as Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney</a>, who believes AI use will be so commonplace there's "no sense" in making every game disclose how it's been used. Does it affect your buying decision?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/28/creative-aurvana-ace-3-wireless-earbuds-review/</link>
            <guid>1367116</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The name Creative means a great deal in gaming and audio circles. Known as the creator of the Soundblaster range of PC audio cards, their range has expanded to include audio products of all kinds, from the excellent Creative Pebble series of speakers through to gaming headphones with SXFI technology. The Creative Aurvana Ace 3 is the newest edition of their ANC-equipped true wireless earbuds, offering a cost-effective alternative to Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 and the Galaxy Buds Pro 3.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are stem-style true wireless earbuds, available in an eye-catching translucent purple colourway, that’s matched through the charging case and each earbud. There is something quite retro about their look, with a mid-noughties vibe that brings an unexpected wave of nostalgia with it. When it’s paired with the silver band running down each stem, they’re certainly unique-looking, but if you’re hoping for a more understated option, this isn’t it.</p>



<p>They feel light in the hand, which diminishes that premium sensation, but it does mean that you can easily wear them for hours without any fatigue. The earbuds are rated for 7 hours, which is an hour less than the AirPods Pro 3 but an hour more than the AirPods Pro 2, with a total of 26 hours of playback with the charging case, all of which played out pretty effectively in our testing.</p>
<p>The charging case lid hinge is a little flimsy, but the body of the case itself feels solid and is the perfect size for chucking in your pocket. It also includes wireless charging, which is a very welcome inclusion. At half the price of their top-end rivals, it’s a good start for the Aurvana Ace 3.</p>

<p>The audio pairing and setup is a little more convoluted than its core competitors, though, as there’s a suite of features to set up to make the most of the Ace 3. The Creative app handles nearly everything here, but you also need the separate SXFi app, which seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, you use Mimi sound personalisation to create a listening profile. This involves a short hearing test – best done in a quiet space – and the results then tailor the output to your own ears. It’s a stark difference, particularly factoring in my 40+ year old hearing, and the years of damage I’ve done to them by, well, listening to headphones that I’ve turned up too loud.</p>
<p>After that, you can choose your EQ presets to tailor the audio to your personal taste, or delve deeper into a custom EQ setup. Even if you’re not clued up about audio, frequencies and kHz, it’s all easy enough to mess around with in search of the roght sound.</p>

<p>The Aurvana Ace sound very good indeed, even without any tuning. Part of that is the ability to utilise the best audio codecs out there, translating LDAC, AptX Lossless and AptX Adaptive into a seamless listening experience. The Ace 3 are equipped with Snapdragon Sound, so if your Android device meets the right specification, not only will you benefit from the high resolution audio, you’ll experience fewer connection issues, and benefit from exceptionally low latency, making your mobile gaming just that bit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Putting them to the test with some of my favourite tracks, I was immediately surprised by just how detailed the audio was from the Ace 3. Billy Eilish’s No Time To Die sounded suitably epic, with her vocals sounding so precise that it felt as though she was singing directly to me.</p>
<p>Changing tack, the brutal cacaphony of Pupil Slicer’s Heather was delivered in spades, losing none of its venom on its way into your ears. It’s always incredibly satisfying to hear new elements in songs, and the Ace 3s combined technologies make that a certainty. The dual xMEMS drivers here certainly help with audio separation, and bass response in particular is fantastic, being rounded and full, without becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>The hybrid ANC proved moderately effective at blocking out background noise, though it is a clear step behind the Airpods Pro 3 and Bose Quietcomfort Ultra, and on a windy walk to work, they struggled against the wind quite a bit. Still, at this price point, it’s effective enough, and with the quality of the audio itself being so high, I don’t think anyone will be too disappointed with their performance.</p>

<p>As with many less expensive earbuds, the touch controls aren’t quite as reliable as their more expensive brethren. The Aurvana Ace 3 does keep things pretty simple, and there’s only one touch point on the main body of each earbud, rather than a panel or squeezable section. That does make changing the volume less efficient, requiring a long press on each earbud to move the volume up and down, and if you’re running that’s a real pain, but it does work, once you’ve adapted to it.</p>
<p>Phone call quality is good, possibly helped by the ability to use Snapdragon Sound via the connection to my Honor Magic V5, and family members confirmed that my voice was clear and easy to hear during calls. It helps to wrap up a compelling package from Creative, and if you’re looking for an excellent-sounding pair of earbuds at a mid-range pricepoint, you’d be hard pressed to find better.</p>
<p>The Aurvana Ace 3 are amongst the easiest earbuds to live with in this price bracket, and though their RRP is £140, you can currently snag them for a slightly bonkers £90 via the Creative website. The Nothing Ear (3) are also worth considering, currently coming in at £139.99, though they have worse battery life than the Ace 3 and are noticeably heavier too.</p>

			<p>Today, Bloober Team announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/exclusive-bloober-team-is-bringing-layers-of-fear-to-switch-2-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Nintendo Life</a> that Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is launching soon on the Nintendo Switch 2. The hybrid handheld/home console platform will receive the first-person horror game on December 19, priced at $39.99. </p>



<p>According to the official info, this version of the game will support High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays as well as ray tracing. This will make it part of the highly restricted club of Nintendo Switch 2 games that actually leverage the hardware's capabilities for ray tracing; for example, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to drop ray traced global illumination in the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in favor of baked global illumination for performance reasons.</p>



<p>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition also features platform-specific improvements, like native motion controls, touch-screen gameplay, and Joy-Con integration. This edition includes all of the Layers of Fear games and DLCs released so far, bringing together the intertwined stories of the three main characters (the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer), each consumed by their devotion to art.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a> of the PC version, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>They say an artist's work is never truly done, but with Layers of Fear, Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have completed the Master Opus started back in 2016. With superb Unreal Engine 5 powered visuals, improved writing and some new gameplay mechanics, these journeys into the darkest recesses of the human mind have never been so immersive, although some issues prevent Layers of Fear from being an absolute masterpiece.</em></p>

            <p>Later today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fan film For Liberty will premiere for the whole of Super Earth to watch. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film will reach almost an hour in length, longer than any other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> fan project made to date.</p>
<p>The fan film is not officially endorsed or made in partnership with Sony or Arrowhead, but it has proven exhilarating to the Helldivers community. As of writing, the latest trailer has accrued almost 300,000 views in just over a month.</p>
<p>The film itself is animated in the Helldivers style, following the experiences of some brave soldiers of Super Earth as they navigate the treacherous galaxy the popular third-person shooter takes place in. It's also fully voice acted, with six actors lending their talents to the project.</p>

<p>One of them - Kevin Lauer - spoke to Eurogamer about For Liberty earlier this week. A previous actor on Plot Coalition's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> series, he is a relatively new fan of the Helldivers series. However, having dived in to better learn about his role and the background for the film, Lauer quickly learned the ins-and-outs of Helldivers quirkiness and its general appeal.</p><p>"I didn't play Helldivers until it launched on Xbox earlier this year, so at first I was guided by the director," Lauer stated. "Then when I played the game I was like: 'oh, that makes sense, I understand that reference now!'</p>
<p>"I would say it is pretty accurate. It's not as humorous as some people think. There are three trailers: one's very liberty, democratic. Another is quite solemn and dark, and the last trailer is in the middle ground. It does have that humour, and there are a lot of things in there I think a lot of fans will recognise. This is made by fans of Helldivers, and I think that will definitely show through."</p>
<p>Lauer plays the Veteran, a stand-in for the community idealised 'John Helldiver' who represents what it means to fight for Super Earth. According to Lauer, the community reception to the project has been exceptionally positive.</p>
<p>Lauer explained: "I've been doing content creation for a while so I'm used to negative comments, but there have been so few. People are excited, or they're asking how long the film is (laughs). But it's been very well received, and as far as I know in terms of fan projects there's been nothing to this scale."</p><p>According to Lauer, even Arrowhead is hosting its own watch party today upon the film's release. He stated: "After the first trailer in February or March, they reached out and they thought it was really cool. I heard there's going to be a watch party for it at Arrowhead, and I think it's really cool that the developers are so engaged with the community."</p>
<p>All of this is fun, but it begs the question: why is Helldivers 2 so ripe for such fan projects. For Liberty may be the largest fan film released, but it's far from the only creative work made in the world of Helldivers. What about the game and its players attracts such passion? For Lauer, the answer is clear.</p>
<p>"One thing I've learned as a new fan is everyone is in on the joke, everyone is 'brainwashed'," Lauer concludes. "If one of my friends in-game is like, that's a dumb thing, I'll shoot him in the head because it's like, don't question democracy. Don't do that, and they'll do it to me! I think it's just a fun simple game, personally I feel there's a need for cooperative games, and it just works. It's nice, it's crazy, and you can just be ridiculous! It's goofy and it plays well."</p><p>

Helldivers 2 continues riding high off its initial popularity, keeping its dedicated fan base engaged with constant updates and an ongoing Galactic War on numerous fronts. One of its biggest strengths is allowing players to tell their own stories, something Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestadt said in a GDC talk on the game's development. You can read more about Helldivers 2, as well as how developers find continous success in the brutal live service market, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">in Eurogamer's longform deep dive on the topic from earlier this month</a>.

            <p>A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647">trademark</a>, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1ST</a>, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as "audio, video and multimedia production" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it.</p>
<p>The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-announces-the-result-of-the-share-issue/">acted on Remedy's behalf</a> numerous times in the recent past, including <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-listing/">advising on the company's stock exchange listing</a> and <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-remedys-contract-negotiation-with-annapurna/">helping negotiate</a> the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>'s development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">partnership deal from last year</a>, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction.</p><p>Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.</p>

            <p>A trademark for something known as Control: Resonant has been registered in Europe, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards next month.</p>
<p>The trademark itself was spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, with the publication noting it has been classified under tags such as video game services, miscellaneous products and the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films.</p>

<p>While Control developer Remedy is not mentioned in the trademark's registration, Nordia Attorneys at Law is. This is the same firm Remedy has used for its previous trademarks.</p>
<p>As for what the end product could actually be, Remedy has already announced a Control sequel. There is also a Control-flavoured film or TV <em>something</em> in the pipeline. In 2024, Annapurna announced it had partnered with Remedy to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">develop and produce film, TV and audiovisual projects based on the studio's Alan Wake and Control franchises</a>.</p>

<p>Control's sequel was first announced back in 2022, with the developer simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">it would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details under wraps, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of last year it stated "important" Control 2 features were now in "playable form"</a>. The following November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-remedy-confirms">Remedy then confirmed the sequel will be an action-RPG</a>. A teaser for the sequel was also, perhaps, tucked away in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">The Game Awards 2025 just a couple of weeks away</a>, it seems that if Remedy has something more to share about Control: Resonant soon, that will be the time to do it. What do you hope Remedy is working on here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Remedy news, earlier this year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak">studio's CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the company</a>. While Remedy's announcement did not indicate a reason for Virtala's departure after 11 years at the company, it followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">profit warning to investors</a> "due to weak sales" of the studio's multiplayer Control spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> is one of this year's biggest surprise hits among the indie crowd, especially since it's a life-sim game about building up your own drug empire. But if the game's subject matter kept it from being sold on Steam, Schedule 1 creator Tyler was going to pivot and make into a farming sim.</p><p>"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game," Tyler told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/creator-of-drug-lord-hit-schedule-1-had-a-backup-plan-so-that-if-steam-wouldnt-take-it-for-whatever-reason-i-could-just-pivot-it-to-be-a-farming-game-and-strip-all-the-drug-stuff-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game--but thankfully, it was all right."</p><p>Tyler went on to note that a few other countries "don't love it," including his native Australia.</p><p>"We were effectively banned in Australia, which kind of sucked, but we got it there in the end," recalled Tyler.</p><p>Schedule 1 may remind some players of Breaking Bad, as the main character moves into a new city and slowly begins to expand their drug dealing operations. Players can grow cannabis in the game, but only in support of selling and distributing it. It's also possible to cook meth while avoiding unwanted attention from the police and rival dealers.</p><p>Although the game is still in early access, Schedule 1 recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-update-adds-rival-cartel-wars/1100-6534328/" data-ref-id="1100-6534328">cartel wars</a> to its features.

			<p>A few hours ago, modder xoxor4d released the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>. This public build even comes with a simple installer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, making it relatively easy for users to install it.</p>



<p>Xoxor4d shared a detailed changelog of improvements over the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod test build that was released last month. You can find it below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a basic installer</li>



<li>Removed alpha blending on some emissive surfaces that were not supposed to be alpha-blended</li>



<li>Night emissives now turn off during the day</li>



<li>Map markers can now be shown/hidden based on the time of day or the current weather</li>



<li>Added a button to teleport yourself to a map marker</li>



<li>Added a FreeCam mode and added a new Utilities tab to the imgui menu</li>



<li>Reduced the default emissive intensity of some surfaces</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that broke the remix debug views</li>



<li>No longer using timecycle temperature because it was not related to color tuning - now using a hardcoded value + reduced influence</li>



<li>Added a special remix replacement to the first apartment</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Remix Runtime</em></p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Added raindrops/splashes to wet world surfaces (disabled by default for pedestrians and vehicles because of varying UV scales, which makes raindrops really large on some cars and really small on others)</li>



<li>Added "puddle logic" to the global wetness code to break up the mirror-like surfaces</li>



<li>The <code>Ignore Lights</code> category can be used to disable the <code>WorldUI</code> texture tag that is automatically set on some emissive surfaces. This allows one to set custom emissive masks and tweaks via a remix replacement while keeping the dynamic intensity adjustment by the game</li>
</ul>



<p>The highlight of the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod is obviously that it injects path tracing into Rockstar's 2008 classic game. The result is a massive visual improvement, as you can see in the featured image and in the additional comparison screenshot below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GTA-4-RTX-Remix-Mod-PT-Comparison-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: MxBenchmark PC (YouTube)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, path tracing, like in any other PC game (and perhaps even more so in a mod that is not as well optimized as a full game for obvious reasons), is rather heavy on performance. As shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the MxBenchmark PC comparison video</a>, even NVIDIA's expensive GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card cannot run the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod at 60 frames per second without the help of DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Modder xoxor4d did have a couple of tips for those who may struggle with performance, though. Those who experience heavy stuttering can try to launch the mod using the included 'LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_2Cores_GTA4.bat' file. This will allocate two cores to GTA4 and the remaining cores to Remix. Another option is splitting your CPU cores 50/50 with NVIDIA RTX Remix; to do that, use the '_LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_Half_GTA4__Half_Remix.bat' file.</p>



<p>The path tracing settings can also be lowered a bit. Just like in every RTX Remix game, you can open the menu by pressing Alt + X. In the Graphics Settings Menu, switch to the Graphics tab and then adjust various quality settings in the Graphics Preset dropdown as needed.</p>



<p>Another tweak that might help performance (though it will also make leaves more blocky) is increasing the Tree Alpha Cutout Value. To do that, open the CompMod menu by pressing F4 and open the Rendering Related Settings container under the Game Settings tab.</p>



<p>Lastly, you can of course still tweak the quality and distance sliders in the regular Grand Theft Auto 4 graphics options. Keeping in mind that higher values will reach your CPU bottleneck earlier, the modder recommends starting with 50 for view distance and 30 for quality and adjusting from there. When making this adjustment, xoxor4d warned that the first launch might cause problems, but a second attempt should resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod can help Grand Theft Auto fans cope with the additional time they'll have to wait until the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> from the previous date of May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Rumors suggest Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-switch-2-explored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may even be trying to make the game run on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though even if that's happening, it would likely be launched at a later date.</p>
