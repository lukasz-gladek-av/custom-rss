  <p id="3Ryskz"><strong>Medallions</strong> are an item added in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a> as of Chapter 5 Season 1, but as seasons have progressed, they’ve been changed. These buffing items are tough to grab and get repeatedly marked on the map, whether it’s through an image of the emblem or a huge <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23752143">golden circle</a>.</p>
<p id="AUrrTX">Below, we detail what Medallions do and <strong>where to find them in </strong><em><strong>Fortnite</strong></em><strong> Chapter 5 Season 3</strong>.</p>
<hr id="H0aN1q">
<h2 id="BxNEfD"><strong>What are Medallions?</strong></h2>
<p id="HX3MVk">Medallions are boss drops that buff you in different ways. The Medallions in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 5 Season 3 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="GJNkn8">
<strong>The Machinist’s Medallion</strong> regenerates shield over time.</li>
<li id="llVBXy">
<strong>Ringmaster Scarr’s Medallion </strong>gives infinite ammo and a small damage buff.</li>
<li id="SN5KCl">
<strong>Megalo Don’s Medallion </strong>gives infinite nitro.</li>
</ul>
<p id="0rW6Fm">Medallions do not take up inventory space, as they have their own respective slot in your bag (like gold does).</p>
<p id="mHErI6">You can also use medallions to enter vaults that have their respective boss’ car inside, if the boss spawned in its respective point of interest.</p>
<hr id="N4VLhl">
<h2 id="qnnkXx"><strong>Where to find Medallions in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</strong></h2>
<p id="DuFYFd">You can see the medallions just straight-up on the map. At the start of the game, the location of all three medallions will be marked on the map. </p>
<p id="VsB9rt"><strong>The bosses will either be in the set point of interest or riding around in a convoy around the map</strong>. You’ll be able to see their medallion icon moving around on the map. The set locations are as follows:</p>

<p id="4XjYhT">Once you get on the battle bus, the emblems for the bosses should appear on your map. If <strong>The Machinist</strong> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24163821/chapter-5-season-3-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s3-t60-power-armor-fallout"><strong>Megalo Don</strong></a> aren’t in their respective POIs, then they’ll be riding around in an envoy with a battle bus and suped-up cars around them. <strong>Ringmaster Scarr</strong> requires you to stay in the <strong>Nitrodome </strong>for a set amount of time before she’ll appear to fight. You can also drive a vehicle through blue rings to lessen the amount of time you need to stay in the Nitrodome.</p>
<p id="7Cd8Ul">To get the medallion, you’ll need to <strong>eliminate the boss NPC holding it</strong>. If the boss you take out is at their POI, you’ll be able to go steal their specialized ride from a locked garage. (Similar to how keycards point you to where the vault is, the medallion will point you to where the car is.)</p>
<p id="SUBqZk">Unlike other NPCs who are pretty easy to drop on and eliminate immediately, these NPCs all have respawning lackies that’ll fire at you once they see you. That said, it may be easier to loot up around the named locations and then head in to nab a medallion.</p>
<p id="SHq2fM">Luckily, the NPCs shoot like Star Wars Storm Troopers (meaning that they aim very poorly), so you shouldn’t have to worry <em>too much</em> about the lackeys. Focus on the boss with a decent gun and you should be able to get a medallion. Note that the boss will replenish its shield frequently, making it an annoying target.</p>
<p id="C4TcVt">If you see an orange or gold circle on the map, this means a player in that vicinity has a medallion, too. You can eliminate that player to take their medallion.</p>

Its amazing art style and evocative musical score are first-class, even if it’s a lot more uneven and esoteric than the crowd-pleasing original. Plus there are 45 playable characters to recruit, including magicians, pirates, rockstars, and a literal human mushroom (he’s called “Funguy” for all you sickos who enjoy puns out there). </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chrono-cross-radical-dreamers-remaster-nintendo-switch-1848752426&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-cross-radical-dreamers-remaster-nintendo-switch-1848752426">I wasn’t a big fan of the remaster</a></span>, <em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</em>, when it launched back in April 2022.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 4 has introduced a ton of new ways to improve builds, and that includes Uber Unique crafting. In order to craft an Uber Unique, you will need four Resplendent Sparks, which can only be obtained a few ways. Once you have the four Resplendent Sparks and 50 million gold, you can speak to the Alchemist in any major city and go to the Transmutation tab. In that tab look for Transmute Sparks, which is where you can craft Uber Uniques.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is an Uber Unique?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308203" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308203"></a><figcaption>Only Uber Uniques that can be used by your class will be available to craft.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4308203-d4uber.jpeg"></figure><p>Uber Uniques are ultra-rare items that have very low drop rates. These are different from the regular Uniques that occasionally drop in Diablo 4. These items always drop at max item power and have some of the most powerful aspects in the game. Since they almost never drop, only occasionally appearing from some world bosses like Duriel, it will be much easier to craft than get one naturally.</p><p dir="ltr">There are only eight Uber Uniques in Diablo 4:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Andariel's Visage (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander (Druid and Sorcerer)</li><li dir="ltr">Doombringer (Barbarian, Necromancer, Rogue)</li><li dir="ltr">Harlequin Crest (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Melted Heart of Selig (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">Ring of Starless Skies (all classes)</li><li dir="ltr">The Grandfather (Barbarian and Necromancer)</li><li dir="ltr">Tyrael's Might (all classes)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">How to get Resplendent Sparks</h2><p dir="ltr">There are four ways to get Resplendent Sparks in Diablo 4 Season 4.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Complete the Seasonal Quest</h3><p dir="ltr">The first method is to complete the Seasonal Quest by getting your Wolf's Honor Rank to level 18. You earn Wolf's Honor by completing the related quests and by completing tasks in Helltides. Killing enemies, completing events, and opening Helltide chests all award some amount of Wolf's Honor. At level 18, you are guaranteed to receive one Resplendent Spark as a reward. <strong>This can be done once per Season 4 character, so you can grind Resplendent Sparks by rolling new characters</strong>.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Defeat Uber Lilith</h3><p dir="ltr">Uber Lilith can be fought in the Echo of Hatred in Fractured Peaks. This tough boss battle will require you to be at least level 90 and have a pretty well-made build. If you don't have max armor and resistances, it can be incredibly difficult to survive this fight, especially solo.</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating Uber Lilith the first time in Season 4 rewards both a Resplendent Spark and a random Uber Unique. If you don't like the Uber Unique that drops or aren't happy with the roll, you can scrap it for another Resplendent Spark.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Tormented Bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">In Diablo 4 Season 4, you can summon Tormented versions of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">various endgame bosses</a>. Summoning the Tormented versions require you to be on World Tier 4 and to use an increased amount of summoning materials compared to normal. For example, summoning Varshan usually requires one Gurgling Head, Blackened Femur, Trembling Hand, and Malignant Heart. Summoning Tormented Varshan requires three of each and two Stygian Stones as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These Tormented versions are a higher level and much tougher to fight. Each boss drops one Resplendent Spark the first time you beat it, so if you have an abundance of summoning materials, it's worth doing.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Farm for Uber Uniques</h3><p dir="ltr">The last method available to you is to farm for Uber Uniques by taking on the two endgame bosses that actually have a chance to drop them. Those bosses are Duriel and Andariel, both of which require you to get summoning materials from defeating other endgame bosses. You aren't likely to get Uber Uniques using this method, but it's the only method that is repeatable on the same character. Scrapping an Uber Unique you don't want will reward one Resplendent Spark.</p>

                <p>With rumors suggesting a PlayStation showcase-style event could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-coming-in-may-report/1100-6522349/" data-ref-id="1100-6522349">coming soon</a>, a new report has revealed a game that is said to be getting an imminent announcement. And it involves one of Sony's most recent platforming heroes, Astro Bot.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, developer Team Asobi is working on a new Astro Bot game simply just titled, Astro Bot. There is reportedly a desert-like area or level and one of the new characters introduced is a fennec in the form of a robot, similar to Astro.</p><p>Additionally, the game will reportedly be exclusive to PS5, and not tied to PSVR 2. The game is reportedly going to be revealed within the next 15 days, which could mean it shows up during a PlayStation showcase if one does indeed take place soon.</p><p>Dealabs has had a consistent track record when it comes to insider information about PlayStation. They reported on Until Dawn getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-getting-new-version-of-until-dawn-report/1100-6520579/" data-ref-id="1100-6520579">PS5 and PC versions</a>, and Sony indeed revealed them back in January. Earlier this month, Dealabs reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-version-will-be-revealed-very-soon-report/1100-6523352/" data-ref-id="1100-6523352">God of War Ragnarok would be coming to PC</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, and also reported that more details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/details-on-ps5-multiplayer-fps-concord-coming-soon-report/1100-6523673/" data-ref-id="1100-6523673">Sony's upcoming live-service, Concord</a>, will be revealed soon.</p><p>The first game in the series, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, was released in 2018 for PS4 and PSVR. The sequel, Astro's Playroom, was released in 2020 and came pre-installed with every PS5 console. Both games were critically well-received and Astro's Playroom served as a tech demo for the PS5's DualSense controller.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-developer-team-asobi-currently-working-on-most-ambitious-game-yet/1100-6494652/" data-ref-id="1100-6494652">Back in 2021</a>, Team Asobi revealed that it was working on its "most ambitious game yet" but it's unclear whether the game is referring to this potential Astro Bot one or a completely different project.</p>

<p data-characters="366" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In Chapter 7 of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, the team needs to find a cannon to get to the moon. Apparently, they subscribe to Sparkster and Doomguy’s newsletter. However, when you visit Fahr Outpost, you find that they won’t even admit the cannon exists. When forced to, the mayor will say he requires the okay from Goldbob and General White to fire it.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Goldbob’s location (in Poshley Heights) will probably be fresh in your memory since you left him there during Chapter 6. However, <strong>you probably haven’t seen General White since Chapter 1</strong>, and even then, he doesn’t make a very memorable appearance. You’d be forgiven for overlooking or forgetting him.</p> <figure data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false"><strong>General White can first be seen way back in Petalburg.</strong> He’s pretty in the dumps at that time. However, when you go back there to find him in Chapter 7, he’ll be gone. If you talk to the Koopa Troopa near where he was or Kroop (the mayor), you’ll be told he went somewhere sunny.</p> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">Just a warning: this whole process requires a lot of travel. The quickest and most convenient way to get through it is to use <strong>the collection of pipes directly beneath Rogueport Square</strong>. Each one leads to one of the chapter locales, and it really cuts down on travel time.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">Go to Keelhaul Key. You won’t find him there either. Talk to Pa-Patch, who will give you the next hint on where to go.</p> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="166" data-injectable="false">Next stop is Glitzville. Of course, he’s not there. If you talk to Podler in the Juice Bar, he’ll say he met General White, but he set off to some great big tree.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Go to the Great Tree where the Puni are. Here, you’d expect to have to talk to the elder, but that’s not the case. Talk to the Puni right inside the door. The next hint suggests Twilight Town.</p> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Head to Twilight Town. Talk to the citizen in front of the inn, and you’ll be given a hint that points you at Fahr Outpost; the place where you started.</p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Return to Fahr Outpost. Talk to the mayor. While in conversation, you’ll see General White step out from a building in the background, then turn around and go back in. Go to where he emerged, and you’ll finally be face-to-face with him. He’ll say he was looking for you this whole time but was also given the runaround. He’s willing to help fire you from a cannon.</p>

<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/">upcoming Modern Horizons 3 release</a> looks to spoil players of every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> format. The third iteration of Modern Horizons brings a massive power creep to the Modern format which will certainly shake up the meta that will develop over the Summer.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">On the Commander side of things, MH3 introduces some much-needed support for energy decks, a swarm of new and reprinted Eldrazi, a Lhurgoyf tribal commander that creates tokens of a staple card, and… “everything” counters?! With such creative approaches to the four Commander preconstructed decks, theory-crafting how to build around them is going to be a blast.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-disa-the-restless-jund-black-red-green" data-injectable="false"><strong>Disa the Restless</strong> (Jund: Black/Red/Green)</h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">The first half of Disa the Restless is a “cheat” effect for <strong>Lhurgoyf</strong> permanents. Building a deck (or being the target of abilities) that discards or mills Lhurgoyf permanents will allow them to be played for free. If this was all that Disa had to offer, she could still be considered a fun and viable MTG commander. But the second half of her card is why her deck is named “<strong>Graveyard Overdrive</strong>.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Disa the Restless is capable of generating tokens that are copies of the <strong>Tarmogoyf</strong> card whenever your creatures deal player combat damage. Tarmogoyf is considered a staple card in many graveyard-based decks. As of 2024, there are nine different card types in MTG which makes the maximum power/toughness that Tarmogoyf can be with its ability 9/10. With Tarmogoyf being priced around $10, Disa prints board value every combat phase.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Omo, Queen of Vesuva</strong> (Simic: Blue/Green)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">Shapeshifters are one of the most fun tribes to play with in MTG Commander. Many of these creatures can be inserted into any other tribal deck to enhance their capabilities. <strong>Omo, Queen of Vesuva</strong> and her <strong>Tricky Terrain</strong> precon deck is no exception to this. Omo introduces “everything” counters which cause lands to be every land type or creatures to be every creature type.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">We haven’t been given official rule clarifications for these “everything” counters, but it’s to be assumed that this would allow lands to be considered Urza lands. Combined with <strong>Urza’s Workshop</strong>, this could be one of the best mana generation engines in Commander.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Satya, Aetherflux Genius</strong> (Jeskai: Blue/Red/White)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">As an energy enthusiast,<strong> Satya, Aetherflux Genius</strong> is the commander that I’m looking forward to the most from Modern Horizons 3. Combining energy generation with copying attacking tokens? Count me in. Satya also sports <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-color-combination-names-explained/">the Jeskai mana colors</a> which contain a healthy variety of energy-related cards and many creatures worthy of being copied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The energy archetype in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> had been seemingly forgotten about for years. But with the <em>Fallout</em> energy-based precon released earlier this year and Satya’s <strong>Creative Energy</strong> precon deck, energy players’ appetites can be sated– for the time being.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity </strong>(WUBRG)</h2> <figure data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Representing the Eldrazi, <strong>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity</strong> is a fusion of two titans: Ulamog and Kozilek. Both of these are also included in Modern Horizons 3, but their fused version is the face of the <strong>Eldrazi Incursion</strong> precon deck. This is one of the more complicated commanders out of the four preconstructed decks, but like most Eldrazi decks, it has tremendous potential.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">To make the most of Ulalek’s ability, you’ll need to understand how the Stack works in MTG. This is the order in which spells are resolved based on their type, player priority, and interactions. You could think of this as the order of operations in math.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">Ulalek’s ability requires careful planning from the player to use efficiently. After casting an Eldrazi spell and paying two colorless mana, you can copy just about every type of spell that you control along with new targets for each. This can outright win games when copying powerful triggers or abilities. The tricky part about it is that the copy ability applies to spells you control, which means that these spells need to be cast and currently on the Stack (under your control).&nbsp;</p>

They repeatedly clarify that this will not likely be the logo we see in the final game, comparing it to a few we saw in early promotional material for <em>Persona 5</em>. The placeholder is pretty simple. Its bold, black text is displayed against a green background, with a P6 at the top that is interlocked. But given Midori already claimed the game would use a green color scheme, this image lines up with their previous leaks.</p><p>It’s not much, but fans are so hungry for a new <em>Persona </em>game<em> </em>that Atlus can mine for a decade of spin-offs, anime, and manga that even seeing an asset used during development is at least a sign of life. Though I’m also mostly ready for the next generation of <em>Persona </em>to begin, part of me is a little bummed that we didn’t get what felt like a proper send off for <em>Persona 5</em>’s Phantom Thieves after <em>Royal</em>. <em>Strikers </em>and <em>Tactica </em>were good but lacked the step forward of something like <em>Persona 4 Arena </em>or <em>Persona 4 Dancing All Night </em>for the last two casts. Is it too much to hope for another <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-off as we make the transition? Give me <em>Persona 5 Arena</em>, Atlus.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">100 Thieves CEO Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag and Richard “Ricky” Bengston, also known as FaZe Banks, have made it official after initially agreeing to go up against one another in a Rust match on<em> Modern Warfare 2 (2009</em>). </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The 100 Thieves <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1794035695428006113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Founding Fathers Lan will be held on May 30, pitting three CoD juggernauts against each other in the 100 Thieves, OpTic Gaming, and FaZe. The CEO of each organization will compete in a 1v1 tournament on Rust in<em> Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</em>. </p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">This all started on May 1 when Jack ‘Courage’ Dunlop posed the idea of going up against Banks in a one-on-one on Rust match, and Nadeshot <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1785786363037794566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “Ricky is free cash, brother. The loser has to make the profile picture of all social media handles for their pages chosen by the winner.” </p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">It didn’t take long for FaZe Banks to clap back. “Intervention radar on first to to 20, is an absolute lock,” Banks <a href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1785788383853449683">said</a>. “You won’t touch double digits, papa. Lock it in RIGHT NOW These fools really like to forget.” The saga took another twist when OpTic Gaming CEO Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez also <a href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1785798674783875103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> to enter the competition. </p> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">If this wasn’t already enough nostalgia, Courage <a href="https://x.com/CouRageJD/status/1794037518524174558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he will be casting the tournament, marking his first time casting Call of Duty in seven years. From 2014 through 2018, Courage cast some of the most important matches during the Call of Duty World League competitive era. It’s hard to tell who would be the favorite in this contest. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">Nadeshot has the most experience as a former professional player, but Banks rose to fame creating sniper montage clips in <em>Call of Duty</em>, and H3CZ can always surprise people given his years around the scene. 100 Thieves did not provide a specific time for the event, or how fans can watch. </p>

<p>The actor - who has previously starred in James Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and No Time to Die - will appear as Isaac, the same character he played in the video game version of The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>"We're beyond thrilled that Jeffrey Wright is joining the cast," the game's developer Naughty Dog <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1794037550690259348">shared</a> on social media platform X.</p> <div>

<p>News of Wright's casting comes after HBO shared a first look at Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in the second season of The Last of Us' TV adaptation. </p>
<p>The two pictures (which you can see below) don't reveal a huge amount, but Joel does have his hair grown out in a slightly longer style, much as he did in the game. Ellie, meanwhile, is bundled up in cold-weather clothing, perhaps out and about in Jackson. As for the lights behind Joel, they suggest this is from <em>that</em> community event, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">originally launched on the PS4 in 2020</a> and has already received an update for those playing on the PS5. It’s not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics — which include native 4K support and improved frame rates — are nice, they’re not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it’s all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There’s a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller’s touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it’s nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I’m sure we’ll see some <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I’m 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn’t exist in <em>TLOU</em>’s timeline).</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-987c4708-aa5a-4623-93fc-46f9ce56289f"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cd0b0e1f-f914-4ffa-ba2a-03ff75d856b2"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.

Here are reviews, interviews, deep dives, and more to explore while we wait to see Ellie and Joel hanging out in the post-apocalypse once again.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23636850/the-last-of-us-season-1-tlou-hbo-ps5-game-reviews-interviews">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-0668300d-1e7d-49df-8042-b487bbee042e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638100/the-last-of-us-zombies-season-2-craig-mazin-bloater">The Last of Us future seasons might be swarming with even more infected monsters</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><figcaption><em>A bloater surrounded by clickers in HBO’s </em>The Last of Us<em>.</em></figcaption></p></figure></div><p>The infected were a constant threat throughout the first season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em></a>, but compared to the game, the show didn’t ultimately feature quite as many different kinds of cordyceps-infected monsters as Joel and Ellie made their way to Salt Lake City.

			<p>Today, out of the blue, Ascendant Studios <a href="https://ascendantstudios.com/2024/05/24/amd-fsr-3-and-hdr-updates-arrive-in-immortals-of-aveum/?utm_source=ascendantstudios.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=captivating-technical-magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of the much-awaited Immortals of Aveum update that introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-debuts-soon-on-consoles-in-immortals-of-aveum-frame-pacing-improvements-hdr-coming-to-pc-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 3 support on consoles</a>. This is the first time that a console game supports any frame generation technology.</p>
<p>Ascendant Studios accomplished the feat with the help of Enduring Games, an Austin-based studio that co-developed a lot of big titles, including Demon’s Souls for PlayStation 5, Godfall for PS5 and the Epic Games Store, Knockout City for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, the cross-platform play update for Borderlands 3, building the first Unreal Engine video-on-demand application with Crunchyroll for the Nintendo Switch system, cross-platform play support for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, cross-platform play &amp; Nintendo Switch console support for Tribes of Midgard, multiplatform support for New Tales From the Borderlands, retargeting Bugsnax for the Nintendo Switch system.</p>
<p>The Immortals of Aveum update did not just add frame generation to consoles. The PC version of AMD FSR 3 was also updated on PC to improve both quality and performance.</p>
<p><em>AMD FSR 3 uses a combination of super resolution temporal upscaling technology and frame generation to deliver smoother framerates in supported games. This technology uses optical flow technology and temporal game data such as motion vectors to generate additional high-quality frames for a higher framerate. On PC, AMD FSR 3 has been updated to a newer, better version which further improves visual quality and performance of its temporal upscaling.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, this Immortals of Aveum update improves Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support across platforms and displays, which the developer says should improve frame pacing issues and even the occasional tearing issues. Lastly, this patch adds High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support on PC.</p>
<p><em>HDR is one of the IOA community’s most highly requested features and our team shared that desire to bring HDR to Immortals of Aveum. This meant taking the time to make the game look great in both SDR and HDR and balancing work on other unannounced projects. We wanted to provide players with gorgeous HDR visuals, and we’re delighted to offer a richer, more visually captivating journey through Aveum we hope all battlemages will enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Will this be the first of several console games to support AMD FSR 3? We'll have to check the quality of its implementation first to answer such a question. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162798/francesca-bridgerton-lord-kilmartin-season-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xGmD8f">While her siblings get huge, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156775/bridgerton-season-3-part-1-review-netflix-polin-3a">sweeping love stories</a>, Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) is quietly winning the relationship game, actually. </p>
<p id="uJ28RU">The sixth Bridgerton is quite different from her more outspoken siblings. Francesca is reserved and quiet, her primary drive in life is the pianoforte, and she’s most passionate when she’s talking about the nuances of musical theory. Whether the attention is good or bad, she’s not too keen on entering the season. Even when the queen discovers her musical talents, names her as the “diamond” of the season, and thrusts her into the spotlight, Francesca would rather not be here, thank you very much. </p>
<p id="NJ70GC">It’s in a quiet moment away from a crowded ballroom where she meets John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). The two have an immediate connection — one that sparks without either of them sharing a word and instead simply enjoying each other’s company in shared silence. It’s an intimacy that takes many couples years to achieve, yet Francesca and Lord Kilmartin easily fall into it.</p>

<p id="9dMV9F">As a romance show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157362/bridgerton-queer-characters-benedict-eloise-brimsley"><em>Bridgerton</em></a> is primarily concerned with dramatic love stories and grand displays of affection. Daphne, Anthony, and now Colin have all had big, epic love stories — the kind that involve tearful confessions and sweeping declarations of love. But Francesca’s is shaping up to be quieter and more subdued. It’s a lovely contrast from the other romances in the show, and that’s what makes it so special. </p>
<p id="Sq1fT6">“There’s a lot of emphasis placed on passionate love,” showrunner Jess Brownell explained to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/franchesca-bridgerton-hannah-dodd-storyline-book-1235005592/">IndieWire</a>. “Love is exciting and thrilling, but there are other kinds of love that are just as valid and meaningful and deep. And so to explore a relationship for Francesca that is based much more on companionship, friendship, common interests, respect and attraction, but perhaps not in a thunderbolt from the sky kind of way is really meaningful. And I think it’s nice to hold space for that.”</p>
<p id="256QMN">Francesca and Lord Kilmartin’s quieter, softer romance slowly grows in the background along Penelope and Colin’s flashier story, but that doesn’t make it any less romantic. In fact, the most romantic gesture in the whole show isn’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown">Anthony and Kate’s verbal sparring</a> or Colin’s carriage love confession or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings telling Daphne that he burns for her</a>. It’s when Lord Kilmartin shows up to the ball with sheet music in his hands, arranged just the way Francesca envisioned.</p>

<p id="KA92gn">“We talked a lot in the writer’s room about love languages and how John is an acts of service guy or a gifts guy rather than a words or physical touch guy. And I think Francesca probably has a similar love language. So when he presents her with that music, again, it’s a silent gesture that speaks a thousand words,” Brownell said. </p>
<p id="ce4Kyr">It speaks to just how compatible the two are. Just because there’s no angsty pining or clandestine hookups doesn’t mean that the attraction isn’t there. It just manifests in a different way, one that sweeps quiet and reserved Francesca off her feet but in a way that doesn’t cause her to stumble and fall. <em>Bridgerton</em> has its share of over-the-top misunderstandings and high-strung emotions designed to create the most dramatic plots possible. Having a couple that is stable, solid, and generally undramatic grounds the tempestuous storylines. In fact, a steadfast love like that is something the more dramatic Bridgerton siblings should aspire to — after all, when that red-hot passion cools down, it’s good to have some kindling steadily burning to fuel the rest of the romance. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout.880818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-best-aa-12-loadout<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When approaching the shotguns in <em>XDefiant</em>, you’re presented with a few solid options. The M870 is your standard shotgun fare with low rate of fire and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-time-to-kill-weapons-in-xdefiant-ranked/">high firepower</a>. Then you have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-double-barrel-loadout/">the Double Barrel</a>, which has a bit more firepower in exchange for just two bullets in the magazine. Then we come to the third shotgun, which throws low fire rate and low magazine size out the window. Here’s the best loadout for the AA-12 in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-attachments-and-gear-for-the-aa-12-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best attachments and gear for the AA-12 in XDefiant</h2> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The AA-12 is a beast in the areas where the M870 and the Double Barrel falter, providing a superior rate of fire and magazine size while sporting the ability to fire in full auto. However, it lacks when it comes to reload speeds and the damage per bullet is rather low by comparison. Even with this in mind, we want to select attachments that further its room-cleaning potential. The following attachments help with just that:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Muzzle Booster</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Chrome Lined</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong> Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quick Draw</li> </ul> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">These above attachments reinforce that room-cleaning playstyle by improving the Rate of Fire, short-mid range potential, and Magazine Size, while sacrificing Movement Speed and Reload Speed considerably. If a Stock is more your thing, you can swap out the Extended Mag or Quick Draw Grip for the Padded Stock.</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Secondary Weapon, the <strong>D50 is a solid choice</strong> thanks to its quick burst of damage. Slap the Compensator, Quick Mag, and Fabric Grip on there for some extra stats to beef up its potential. As for Device, you can run whatever you want and likely be fine, <strong>barring the Proximity Mine</strong> since you won’t be holding a position much.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-should-you-run-with-the-aa-12" data-injectable="false">Which faction should you run with the AA-12?</h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">For faction choice, <strong>the Cleaners</strong> seem like a clear first choice thanks to the Incinerator Drone providing a good bit of ranged damage in a pinch. Alternatively, you can run the Libertad with the El Remedio ability if you’re looking to hold down a site instead of rotating frequently.</p>

<p data-characters="413" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In a recent interview with Sony, Naughty Dog president and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a></em> creative director Neil Druckmann commented on the potential of using AI to “push the boundaries of storytelling in games,” suggesting it could be used for writing dialogue and creating characters. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people don’t like this, including several of Druckmann’s own peers within the games industry.</p> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">As a writer himself, you’d think Druckmann would be one of the last people to approve using AI tools for storytelling. And yet, in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Sony interview</a>, he talks about how AI will “allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters,” which makes it sound like he and his team didn’t achieve that with <em>The Last of Us</em> games. This is despite the fact that the series has been lauded for its storytelling and characters, and they didn’t need an AI program to earn such praise.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I should add that I think Druckmann deserves his props. Good game direction and vision IS important, but believing it's the ONLY thing that's important is the road to becoming an auteur… and I guess I'd hope he'd know better than to look at AI as some kind of magic wand. 😕</p>— David Gaider (@davidgaider) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1793820356102566210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, Druckmann never talks about replacing human writers wholesale, arguing how important it is to “direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes.” He also acknowledges there are “ethical issues we need to address,” but he never cites exact examples. All in all, his arguments have done little to sway the minds of industry people who don’t see AI as this exciting new tool for storytelling in games.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/Kotaku/status/1793664069779795977/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Max Krieger</a>, who developed puzzle game <em>CROSSNIQ+</em>, made his feelings clear by saying he’d like to “Push <em>The Last Of Us</em> Director To Retire,” while <a href="https://x.com/EZE3D/status/1793755218116792811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Bourdages</a>, lead character artist on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, has called Druckmann’s comments “disappointing to see,” adding, “Creative people want to create, they don’t want to play babysit/tune the robot.”</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/PikminMan/status/1793731575403716931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Des Walsh</a>, senior environment artist at Sumo Digital, wrote, “Well I bet his team loves to read this after doing all the heavy lifting on them [sic] games.” Meanwhile, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/venba-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venba</a></em>‘s creative director and writer <a href="https://x.com/brownmoney__/status/1793828908414202174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Abhi</a> has outright called Druckmann’s comments as only being for shareholders: “Much like Uber/Lyft, AAA is desperately betting on being able to replace their labour force with AI for their business model of giant games to be feasible.”</p>
 <p data-characters="619" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Bioware veteran and Summerfall Games founder <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1793797519450800170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">David Gaider</a> also didn’t pull his punches, saying “It’s pretty telling that [Druckmann’s] idea of storytelling is all about direction. The only thing preventing AI from improving on Naughty Dog’s own writers, apparently, is the ability to provide it nuanced direction. … I guess I’d hope he’d know better than to look at AI as some kind of magic wand.” Obsidian’s studio design director <a href="https://twitter.com/jesawyer/status/1793703474359587240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Josh Sawyer</a> (who also directed <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/pentiment-review-pc-xbox-series-x-obsidian-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a></em>) may have the best response of all, though, simply tweeting the Mourinho Disgust meme.</p>
 <p data-characters="697" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="false">AI being used for game development remains a very contentious topic, and for good reason. There are genuine and well-founded fears of studios replacing human creatives (artists, writers, voice actors etc.) with AI programs (there was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/video-game-strike-approved-by-sag-aftra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole voice actors strike over it</a>). Companies <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-ghostwriter-ai-technology-npc-dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-trains-ai-generator-on-its-own-assets-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> have shown an eagerness for using these sorts of AI tools, despite the fervent backlash from regular gamers and the fact that AI generated content is always inferior to something a real person made. If Druckmann wants to improve storytelling at Naughty Dog, then he should support his actual writers, and not saddle them with a machine that pumps out dialogue and character ideas for them.</p>

<p data-characters="189" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new roguelike game mode is coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em> in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-version-4-7-release-date-new-characters-primogem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Version 4.7</a>. From character selection to buffs and Primogem rewards, here’s everything you need to know about Imaginarium Theater!</p> <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-requirements-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater requirements in <em>Genshin Impact</em></h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">To start, you need to be Adventure Rank 35 or higher to participate in Imaginarium Theater. If you’re not quite there yet, keep participating in quests, exploration, and daily activities until reaching AR35</p> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The challenge begins in the Imaginarium Theater room, simply interact with the book on the table.</p> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-character-selection" data-injectable="false">Character Selection</h2> <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Six characters will be chosen for you as your starting roster. They will be chosen based on the theme of the current Imaginarium Theater cycle. If you are missing any of the six characters, you will be able to play with a trial version of that character. You will immediately have access to these six characters when you start your first combat stage. These six characters will receive stat buffs for the duration of the Imaginarium Theater cycle, even outside of the Theater. And yes, this includes the Spiral Abyss!</p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">On top of the six pre-selected characters, you will also choose several additional characters from your personal collection. These are limited to characters of certain elements (depending on the Theater cycle) and a few special exceptions. You can also borrow a character from one of your friends! These additional characters won’t be immediately available when you start your challenge, but they will be unlocked as you progress through the stages.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">Each character starts with two Vigor points, allowing them to be used twice in combat. Each fight deducts one Vigor, and when no Vigor remains, the character can no longer be used in combat.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-progress-in-imaginarium-theater" data-injectable="false">How to progress in Imaginarium Theater</h2> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Start your challenge and progress through the stages. There are three difficulty levels of Imaginarium Theater, and each difficulty has a different number of combat stages you need to clear. The Easy challenge has three stages, Normal has six, and Hard has eight.</p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">You can choose to take on a Battle stage to progress your challenge, or choose an Event card to obtain characters or buffs. These Event cards cost points, and you can earn more points through combat.</p> <figure data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Battle stages have a primary goal you’ll need to achieve in order to clear the stage. Taking a page from the Spiral Abyss, these primary goals will likely be along the lines of defeating a certain number of enemies, or defending a monolith. In addition to this primary goal, there are also bonus challenges for meeting certain conditions, which will award additional points. There are also star challenges, which don’t award points but give you a fancy badge on your profile.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">Before starting a Battle stage, you must craft a team of four characters from your available roster. Remember that a character can only fight if they have Vigor, so you may want to conserve a powerful character for later stages. It will also be important to craft teams that work cohesively. If you have any strong, flexible characters (e.g., <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>), they will be invaluable for Imaginarium Theater challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-rewards" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater rewards</h2> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">Clearing a certain number of stages in Imaginarium Theater awards Primogems, among other materials. Here are the Primogem rewards you’ll get for clearing Imaginarium Theater at each difficulty:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Difficulty</th><th data-align="center"># of Stages</th><th data-align="center">Total Primogems<br>(per cycle)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Easy</td><td data-align="center">3</td><td data-align="center">100</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Normal</td><td data-align="center">6</td><td data-align="center">200</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hard</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">620</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">In addition to the recurring rewards each cycle, there are additional rewards for completing an Imaginarium Theater challenge for the first time. Clearing all eight stages in Hard mode grants a one-time reward of 1,100 Primogems.</p> <h3 id="h-photo-poses" data-injectable="false">Photo poses</h3> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">Among the rewards are unique poses for characters in photo mode. These poses don’t affect idle animations, but they will allow specific characters to have special poses while you take photos in the open world. The starting list of characters with special poses includes Xiangling, Raiden Shogun, Jean, and Chongyun, but I expect there will be more. Each new cycle of Imaginarium Theater will add new character poses to choose from.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-imaginarium-theater-update-schedule" data-injectable="false">Imaginarium Theater update schedule</h2> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Each cycle of Imaginarium Theater will last one month, starting from the first of each month.</p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false">The Spiral Abyss update schedule will also be adjusted to last a full month instead of the current two weeks. Spiral Abyss will update on a monthly basis on the 16th, creating an alternating schedule of Theater/Abyss updates.</p>

<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Kuro Games has revealed its plans for the future of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, including updates adding story skips, the companion story for Yinlin, and rewards thanking players for their support during the game’s launch. </p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> launched this week to hundreds of eager fans who were more than ready to jump into another premium open world game with collectible characters and gacha mechanics similar to <em>Genshin Impact</em>. While it had its ups and downs <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-stuck-verifying-file-integrity-error-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with errors</a> to start with, the game soon settled down and welcomed players into its world. Now with launch hiccups behind the team, Kuro Games has relayed what it intends to do to update the game with future features and fixes. </p>
 <h2 id="h-kuro-games-will-update-ui-and-combat-in-wuthering-waves-and-reward-players-for-their-support-with-in-game-items" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games will update UI and combat in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and reward players for their support with in-game items</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Kuro Games is keen to reward players for their patience while <em>Wuthering Waves</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-the-gateway-connection-timed-out-error-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced issues</a> around its launch. To do this, it’s giving all players 10 free Radiant Tide on May 25 as long as they’ve hit Union Level 2 or above.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>– We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay. Most of the story content will…</p>— Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">On <a href="https://x.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, the company also noted that it would be giving players a free custom 5-Star Standard Resonator Voucher. This will be issued as part of the upcoming <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resonator Giveback Convene Event</a> to apologize for the subpar experience some layers had with the Beginner’s Choice Convene. You should receive your voucher in your in-game mail on May 26, 2024. </p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">The skip function is the first feature Kuro Games wants to improve in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. This is based on a lot of the feedback from players who insist there are “not enough skippable scenes” and that the UI isn’t readable enough for them to notice and use. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">The skip function UI will be redesigned, and the number of scenes that can be skipped early on in the story will be increased to allow players to blast through early scenes faster. There will also be a better system for skipping character dialogue where it pops up for those who don’t want to sit through it. </p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">The developer also says that Yinlin’s companion story is coming soon. Yinlin won’t be in the game until June 2024, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-fans-figured-out-how-to-unlock-characters-early-but-the-exploit-may-already-be-patched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players have been using an exploit to unlock her early</a>, prompting this response from Kuro Games.</p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games’ second priority is optimizing the combat experience in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. Players have reported a lack of visual feedback and generally unsatisfying combat with enemies and environmental objects. The team will work on improving this so combat feels better both on screens and using controllers, for which players desperately want customizable layouts. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Very Serious Debate About Which Supergiant Song Is Best]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/supergiant-bastion-transistor-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-very-serious-debate-about-which-supergiant-song-is-best.880794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/supergiant-bastion-transistor-music<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supergiant's very good game <em>Transistor</em> turned 10 years old this week, which prompted Riley and Nathan to discuss it during an Aftermath meeting. OK, by "discuss," we actually got into an argument about whether it or <em>Bastion</em> had a better iconic song. Expanding that argument into a full-blown conversation really went places.  </p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Hello, Nathan! The other night, you and I got into an argument in a meeting when you suggested <em>Transistor</em>'s song "Paper Boats" is better than <em>Bastion</em>'s song "Build That Wall." I failed to record the conversation, but it went like this: I said "no," and you said "yes," and then we repeated that for a while while everyone watched us. </p><p>After having an entire day to consider it, I regret to inform you that you are still wrong: "Build That Wall" is better! But in the interest of journalistic objectivity, I will pretend to listen to your argument while impatiently waiting for the chance to remind you how wrong you are.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I will begin by saying that "Build That Wall" is a very good song! One of Supergiant's best, without a doubt. It conveys the game's themes in a very on-the-nose way without coming across as artificial. It fits perfectly within the game's universe. If you're gonna add a song with lyrics to a video game, "Build That Wall" is how you do it.</p><p>But "Paper Boats" is <em>Transistor</em>'s emotional crescendo. It HITS harder. There was a lot going on in <em>Transistor</em>'s story, but the relationship between Red and the narrator -- who turned out to be her partner, trapped inside the Transistor after being killed with it -- cuts through the many machinations of various cyberpunk factions. At the end of the game, Red opts to run herself through with the Transistor so that the two can be reunited. On one hand, it's an upsetting scene -- the narrator pleads with her not to do it -- but it demonstrates her determination as a character. This is what she wants, ultimately. The credits show them together as "Paper Boats" plays.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Transistor Original Soundtrack - Paper Boats" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFrjMq4aL-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A few things are happening in the song itself: For most of the game, the narrator has spoken for Red, a singer who lost her voice. Now her voice is back. Second, the two finish the song -- which builds magnificently -- by harmonizing together. If you are a hopeless romantic in their mid-20s -- which I was at the time that I played <em>Transistor</em> -- that shit hits. "I will always find you, like it's written in the stars" might be a little schmaltzy, but I don't care. The song still gives me chills.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'm a little hazy on <em>Transistor</em>'s plot; the game came out ten years ago, which is what prompted us to discuss it in the first place. Viewed through this lens, I can see your argument. But I'd counter with this: "Build That Wall," in particular through its simple instrumentation and very good bass riff, grabs me without context. It's short and straightforward, and it doesn't need a ton of explaining. "Build That Wall" has less lyrics to start falling into schmaltz. It feels very... purely itself, without trying to sound like a song you could hear outside of a video game. I appreciate it for that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bastion Original Soundtrack - Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3SZee4YZX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I mean, "Paper Boats" works without context too. It definitely works better with context, but so does any Supergiant song. Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett just make good music, lol. I appreciate that both songs also FEEL like their respective worlds, even though they're from the same people.</p><p>"Build That Wall," like you said, uses relatively simple instrumentation, whereas "Paper Boats" starts out relatively sparse, but even then, it carries a kind of synth-y menace that mirrors the human alienation that tends to come part and parcel with cyberpunk settings.</p><p>They're both good!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>This is true! "Paper Boats" is a bit more... "I am a song" than "Build That Wall" because it comes from a world with more everything, including things to make music on. Where "Build That Wall" reflects the destruction of <em>Bastion</em>'s world.</p><p>I sort of tend to judge how good I think a song is by how much fun it would be to play. After our argument, I looked up the ukulele tabs for "Build That Wall" and they're nice--the riff isn't quite so bass-y on a ukulele, which doesn't strictly speaking have bass, but it's a fun riff to play. Plus it has a G minor, which is one of my favorite chords. "Paper Boats," by contrast, features an E chord, the ukulele's most cursed chord.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Lmao. Well, I recently sang "Paper Boats" at karaoke, and while a) it is hard, it is also b) fun as hell to belt. So I think we're tied in this category.</p><p>That said, I have a secret weapon in this argument.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Oh no.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> "Paper Boats" has never been tarnished by a live performance that prominently featured the incredibly out-of-place singer of Imagine Dragons.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Imagine Dragons - Build That Wall (Darren Korb Cover) with Ashley Barrett" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdULihbHkt4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdULihbHkt4" target="_blank"></a><strong>Riley: </strong>Haha, I saw that this existed when I was looking up the song and decided not to engage with it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Look at him sway back and forth awkwardly. Even he doesn't know what he's doing there!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I found a recording of Korb and Barrett performing "Paper Boats" at Day of the Devs, and on just guitar I actually liked it more. But I have very weird musical tastes, which are a combination of punk rock, musical theater, and gospel hymns from the 1800s, that last one representing a love of straightforward lyrics and musical simplicity that make "Build That Wall" or this stripped-down arrangement of "Paper Boats" much more my jam.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Darren Korb &amp; Ashley Barrett - Paper Boats – Day of the Devs 2017, San Francisco" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7ziU3RRacw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That said, if you're adding Game Awards performances into all this, that sort of changes the game! Like... Imagine Dragons on the stage makes everything worse, where last year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmU3mZ5gBc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>performance</a> just made what was great about "Herald of Darkness" even better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So what we have here is a weird performance of "Build That Wall" and a great performance of "Paper Boats" (that people decided to disrespectfully talk over). Seems like "Paper Boats" is still winning to me.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Maybe, as with your opening argument, it's the context. But then maybe what makes Game Awards "Build That Wall" worse is that it attempts to add things to a song that shines because it's so bare bones. Like Imagine Dragons is working against what makes the song great.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I agree! But for better or worse, it's part of the canon now.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I feel like I'm letting you change the grounds of the argument in order for you to win, trickery you only require to counter the stark reality of how right I am.</p><p>"Build That Wall" just gets in and gets out! It does what it needs to do in about half the time of "Paper Boats" and lets me get on with things.</p><p>It would be less fun to sing at karaoke, though.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Damn, giving me TWO wins in this multifaceted Olympic competition between songs? The results speak for themselves: "Paper Boats" is better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>My love of "Build That Wall" seems predicated on simple things like a very basic, pretty song, and being able to enjoy it by playing it myself alone in my house, where your love of "Paper Boats" seems built on social settings and the stuff that surrounds it. Which does feel very indicative of our different characters.</p><p>Luckily for us, they are both very good songs. Supergiant is very good at songs! In this instance they are better at one song than another, and that song is "Build That Wall," but still: good at songs.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>While I hear and respect what you are saying, I remain unconvinced. I hope that this clear fissure does not result in one of us digging a hole while the other builds a wall.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now through May 31st, there’s a great chance to scoop one up at a lower price than you’ll find at retail. </p><p>You could go with a refurbished unit of the handheld-only <strong>Switch Lite</strong>, for example, which is down to $160.99 ($39 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-lite-timmy-tommys-aloha-edition-grade-a-refurbished-1">Woot</a> for a light blue “Timmy and Tommy Aloha” model or $164.95 (about $35 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-lite-grade-a-refurbished">Woot</a> for one in coral pink. </p><p>If you anticipate wanting to play on a TV, you can pick up an <strong>original Nintendo Switch</strong> model with a dock and detachable Joy-Con controllers in refurbished condition for $239.99 ($60 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/nintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joycon-grade-a-refurbished-3">Woot</a>.

Each purchase includes Woot’s 90-day limited warranty.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch might not get all of the same AAA gaming experiences that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S do, but there’s a healthy mix of new releases in the pipeline. You’ll also get to explore an expansive back catalog, which features first-party blockbusters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pok</em>é<em>mon Legends: Arceus</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros.

Now down to a record-low $174.99 ($75 off) from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-play-hdmi-sync-box-%2F046677555221">Philips</a>, the box lets you plug in up to four HDMI sources, allowing your lights to match colors with the content you watch or respond to the beat of what you listen to. It supports 4K HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision content at refresh rates up to 60Hz, so it may not be the best fit for newer gaming consoles if you need to play up to 144Hz (though it does support the faster refresh rate if you play in 1440p). It does require the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhue-bridge%2F046677458478">Hue Bridge</a>, which adds another $59.99 to your purchase if you don’t already have one.</li><li><strong>Sony’s affordable WH-CH520 wireless headphones</strong> are down to around $38 (about $22 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1PRC4L?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmjNbMUEDnZ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WH-CH520-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-with-Microphone-Black%2F2247478998">Walmart</a>, matching their all-time low. The affordable on-ear headphones can’t exactly compare to a more substantial pair like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review">Sony’s WH-1000XM5</a> or even the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX?tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH720N</a>, but that’s to be expected considering the staggering cost difference. You’ll miss out on noise cancellation and some other advanced features, and they might not be quite as comfy as their more expensive siblings. However, the WH-CH520 should offer solid sound quality in a pinch, and the battery is rated to last up to an impressive 50 hours. You’ll also get Bluetooth multipoint for seamless multi-device switching, fast pairing with Google Find My Device support, and voice-activated Google Assistant and Siri.</li><li>There’s a rare sale going on for <strong>Adobe’s Creative Cloud Photography plan </strong>with 1TB of cloud storage.

<p>After arriving on Wednesday, Wuthering Waves was <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">beset by issues</a> around player logins - with some players unable to log in at all, while others were forced to log back in whenever they relaunched the game on PC - and performance issues ranging from from lags and freezes to low frame rates and straight-up crashes. (Whether related to these specific complaints or not, our own James detailed his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">extensive efforts to get the game to even boot on a Steam Deck</a>, to no avail.)</p>
<p>Kuro have raced to fix the problems by issuing a series of hotfixes that have so far sorted the login issues, along with promising that patches to address the performance troubles and complaints about the game’s localised text are also in the works.</p>
<p>Slightly longer-term, the studio have now offered a look at some other improvements on the way, which are more aimed at overall game experience than technical woes.</p>
<p>The list of future plans includes improvements to the game’s current system for skipping scenes, both increasing the number of in-game scenes that can be skipped during the game’s story and resigning the button in the UI to make it easier to find. While Kuro cites “technical constraints” as making full cutscenes unable to be skipped, the optimised system should still make it easier to whizz through the main quest outside of cinematics.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>- We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay. Most of the story content will…</p>— Wuthering Waves (@Wuthering_Waves) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wuthering_Waves/status/1794025519521972554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The other incoming change is to combat, with Kuro planning to “optimise the combat experience” by adding more visual responses for attacks, stopping objects in the environment blocking the view of battles and doing a better job of providing feedback on combat actions.</p>
<p>Those headline changes will join with other assorted optimisations, fixes and “new functions and gameplay elements” in the works, with better maps, NPC artwork and Echo transformations all mentioned as being somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>To apologise for the issues so far, Kuro will give players who are Union Level 2 or higher by July 3rd ten Radiant Tide items. That joins a second item, a Voucher of Reciprocal Tides, which will be available for the next year as sorry for “the unsatisfactory experience” of the Beginner's Choice Convene; the item gives you the chance to grab one 5-star Standard Resonator of your choice for free.</p>
<p>I can’t honestly pretend to know exactly what all that means, having not delved into Wuthering Waves properly myself yet, but free stuff is always nice, right?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-cheats-codes">The Sims 4</a> is fast approaching its 10th birthday this September, a fact that genuinely instilled me with the crushing sense of time marching relentlessly on when I checked its release date a moment ago. That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>The game’s developers over at EA are as aware of this as anyone, and they’re now looking to step up their efforts in blowing out some of the dust, oiling the gears and getting the wonderful interlocking machinery at the heart of the PC modern-classic (is 10 years old enough to justify as a classic? It feels apt here) to purr along smoothly again.</p>
<p>To do so, the devs have put together a whole new team to focus on tackling bugs, fixing technical troubles, improving performance and just generally improving the overall experience of playing, acknowledging that there are a number of outstanding problems that have “caused much frustration” for fans. In essence, the presence of the new team should mean more fixes for both big and small issues reported by the community - <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024">as tracked on the team’s ‘Laundry List’ of requests</a> - landing at a more regular clip than before.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Specifically, the team say that updates should now land every two months or so, starting with an update later this month that should include fixes for pairing nose rings and brow piercings, seasonal weed-growing, and an error relating to summoning a Grilled Cheese (cheese toastie, please), among many others. Ah, god bless The Sims. The game’s next patch will then look to optimise memory use to reduce crashes, up frame rates and generally boost responsiveness and performance, with patch notes that are probably a bit less entertaining to read.</p>
<p>The team’s announcement vows that “our team is more dedicated than ever to developing great The Sims 4 gameplay experiences into the foreseeable future” - the formation of this team certainly seems to speak to that, especially with not-officially-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">aka Project Rene</a> still appearing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">be a good ways off</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-series-reveal-reportedly-coming-soon-as-may-playstation-showcase-rumors-persist.880776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been a lot of quality first-party PlayStation 5 games, but perhaps the most underappreciated is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/astros-playroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro’s Playroom</a>. Sure, it was just a relatively small-scale pack-in title, but Astro’s Playroom was a ton of fun and made better use of the Dualsense controller’s unique features than any game since.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reliable leaker Billbil-kun</a>, a new entry in the Astro series, simply titled Astro Bot, is in the works at Team Asobi and will be revealed sometime within the next 15 days. Billbil-kun hints that the game may have multiple playable characters, including one that looks like a fennec fox, and may have multiple themed environments, including a desert-y level. Fingers crossed for a larger-scale game of similar quality as Astro’s Playroom.</p>
<p>While our leaker doesn’t explicitly state it, if seems likely the Astro Bot reveal will coincide with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new PlayStation Showcase rumored for May</a>. Jeff Grubb was the one that initially started the rumor, and he’s stuck to his guns since, and <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793156746976039017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a> has since chimed in to say he’s heard the showcase will happen somewhere around May 28. Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it certainly seems like some sort of PlayStation show is coming, even if perhaps happens in early June instead of late May.</p>
<p>While Sony has stated they won’t be releasing any “major franchise” titles this fiscal year (which runs until the end of March 2025), that doesn’t mean big third-party exclusives and smaller, more experimental first-party titles might now be on the way. In addition to Astro Bot, we’ve already heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalk Studios’ new multiplayer shooter IP Concord may soon be fully revealed</a>, so it seems like the upcoming PlayStation Showcase may be a good one for those missing Sony’s quirkier, more original side.</p>
<p>What do you think? Excited for the possible return of Astro Bot? Personally, I still consider Astro’s Playroom one of my favorite PS5 exclusives, so I’m surprisingly hyped.</p>

The games share a lot in common and it’s clear that Ubisoft wants this new free-to-play shooter—out now on consoles and PC—to compete with Activision’s juggernaut military FPS.<br></p><p>Ubisoft isn’t the first publisher to try and take on the beast that is <em>Call of Duty</em>, but its approach isn’t just to be a carbon copy of modern <em>CoD</em> (but free). Instead, <em>XDefiant </em>strips back a lot of the digital bloat and annoying nonsense—like multiple game installs and extra modes—that have made <em>Call of Duty </em>into a hard-to-parse disaster for newcomers or returning players. This simplifying of the <em>CoD </em>formula applies to gameplay, too.<br></p><h2 id="h26386"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast and deadly</strong></h2><p>Maps in <em>XDefiant </em>are smaller than a lot of modern <em>CoD </em>playgrounds and are built around objective-focused game modes. This helps funnel you into action and keeps <em>XDefiant </em>feeling fast and exciting.<br></p><p>Also helping to keep the speed up is how quickly you move in <em>XDefiant</em>. Pulling out your handgun makes you run like a world-class sprinter, and you can slide and hop around the map like a bunny being chased by a hungry wolf. Characters in <em>XDefiant</em> are extremely nimble and responsive, reminding me more of how<em> Call of Duty</em> played during the Xbox 360-era of the franchise. Time to kill is also a bit higher than in some other modern shooters, giving you a chance to escape or turn around to fight back.<br></p><p>Outside of combat, <em>XDefiant </em>sports a handful of modes, a dozen or so guns, some attachments, and abilities, and that’s it. You can create custom classes using characters from other Ubisoft games—like the rebels from <em>Far Cry 6</em> who specialize in healing, or <em>Splinter Cell</em> agents with invisible camo—but this process is pretty streamlined. </p><p>I didn’t feel overwhelmed by options, and while future updates and seasons will add more, <em>XDefiant</em> feels designed to be easy to hop into and have fun. And I appreciate that.<br></p><h2 id="h26387"><a id=""></a><strong>Small is good</strong></h2><p>This may seem weird to note, but a big advantage <em>XDefiant </em>has over so many other modern multiplayer shooters is the digital footprint of the game. On my Xbox Series X, <em>XDefiant</em> takes up just over 30 GB of space, which isn’t tiny, sure, but compared to <em>Battlefield 2042</em> (90+ GB) and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/17zpvgo/is_it_normal_for_warzone_to_take_138_gb_on_xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Call of Duty MW3/Warzon</em>e</a></span> (130+ GB), it’s pretty small. You likely won’t have to delete a few games just to install <em>XDefiant</em>, which is nice in 2024.</p><p>At this point, <em>XDefiant </em>has laid down a solid foundation for an online FPS. Combat feels snappy and fun, the maps are well made and look nice, and the game isn’t too big and feels focused on keeping players in the action and not in menus. What’s here is solid and I’m excited to play more.</p><figure id="" data-id="779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-recommend-id="image://779580ae9108cd15aacdc008dd5f66da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows a character from XDefiant wearing a gas mask.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, the key to <em>XDefiant’s </em>success is now up to Ubisoft and its developers. Today, games like this can’t just launch and be done. <em>XDefiant </em>will have to get fresh content at a regular pace—like new maps and characters—to have a chance against the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wasteland-fallout-magneto-1851499167"><em>Fortnite</em>s<em> </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em>s of the world</a></span>.<br></p><p>I can’t see into the future—if I could I’d not be writing about games for a living. My lack of clairvoyance means that I can’t tell you if a year from now <em>XDefiant </em>will be doing well and getting new content or if Ubisoft fails to keep the game active and it dies. </p><p>I hope that <em>XDefiant </em>has a long future ahead of it. The game is good and I’m happy to have a modern arena shooter back in my life that isn’t bogged down by battle royale nonsense, too many modes, or massive installs. But only time will tell if <em>XDefiant </em>succeeds, or if it joins so many other games that tried and failed to compete with <em>Call of Duty. </em><br></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With no real demand put upon me as a player, there was nothing for me to push back against, no enjoyable texture or sense of accomplishment, and so I moved on. Now, however, I’m in a different place, one where a pleasant, low-key journey through a vast and beautiful world sounds appealing, so I’m approaching it with a different mindset. I’m thinking of it more as a way to unwind after a long day at work like I might with a good book, rather than as a game I come to for challenges I can overcome. (I’m well aware that the game, with its tough dungeons and raids, has plenty of challenging encounters and opportunities for skillful play if that’s what you want. But it’s the quality of the story campaigns that I’ve heard so much about, so that’s primarily what I want to experience, at least to start.)</p><p><br>And so far, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>is proving to be a lovely, pleasantly low-pressure experience. I log on sometime in the evenings, play a few main story quests (and whatever side quests I can gather along the way), and just enjoy being in Eorzea and seeing my marauder continue her journey to becoming the Warrior of Light. The world, with its elegant cities and vast countryside, is distinctive and fun to explore, and though I mostly tend to keep to myself, the community seems very pleasant and positive.

So far grimly unnoticed by the games press, this is a bloody brilliant <em>Zelda</em>-like, presented in monochrome chunky pixels, with a sublime journey delivered through new skills opening up new areas.</p><p>It’s monstrously clever about it all, encouraging widespread exploration to discover how your latest upgrade unlocks entire new dungeons where previously you thought there was only a plain wall, and boss fights are scrupulously fair. It’s wordless, but the game’s smattering of NPCs communicate in the simplest of image-based speech bubbles, letting me weave my own narrative and motivations for everything that’s going on.</p><p><br>And despite the <em>reasonably</em> small map, it’s enormous, multi-layered and bulging with secrets. It’s such a brilliantly refined delivery of the old-school <em>Zelda</em> format, streamlined to its purest excellence, and most importantly, has a hookshot <em>and</em> boomerang. Those are worth 20 percentage points each, ensuring an already great game scores at around the 124 percent mark. — John Walker  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-recommend-id="image://e067d9a173482c679d9ba101a4c9d7cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring shows the character has died." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Give it just one more chance to see if we work well together</p><p>Here I am again, wondering if I can put up with a FromSoft game of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s caliber. No, I’m not good at these kinds of games generally speaking. I’ve played various Soulslikes to mixed results (I <em>did</em> finish all of <em>The Surge</em>). But I do get curious from time to time. A friend of mine suggested I start with <em>Demon’s Souls</em> on PS5. That idea is enticing...but with the new <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC coming in a month, I feel a sense of urgency here.</p><p>Well, I haven’t learned my lesson, it would seem. I am presently redownloading <em>Elden Ring</em>. Am I going to continue with my old character I abandoned in 2022? Maybe? Can I possibly get far enough in a month for a game that I’m not too jazzed about to get into its expansion? Perhaps?</p><p>I want to like this game. I want to understand what others see in it.

In my defense, May ended up being packed full of amazing indie games I had to play and cover, but it did mean that my <em>FF14</em> missions got put <em>wayyyyyyyy</em> on the back burner. But now May is nearly over and I am pretty sure I’ve played all the new releases I want to, so it’s time to get serious. </p><p><br>Thankfully, this weekend seems like the perfect time for me to do a marathon through the story. It’s a three-day weekend and my fiancee is out of town, meaning I can stop being a real person and just live on my couch running around Eorzea as a bunny girl. So this time, for real, I am going to complete <em>Endwalker</em>.

Its sci-fi worldbuilding is evocative, its story is intriguing but not belabored, and the action hits a perfect sweet spot of arcade combat and RPG-lite progression. I’d be far from the first person to suggest there’s a heavy dose of nostalgia in how it appears to successfully straddle the divide between the streamlined focus of an early PS3 game and the systems-heavy bloat of a late PS4 one.</p><p>Each level has just enough trinkets to pick up, enemies to fight, and forks in the road to explore to keep me engaged without ever getting overwhelming.
