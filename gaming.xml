            <p>I’d initially assumed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sliding-hero">Sliding Hero</a> counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966300/Sliding_Hero/">Sliding Hero’s Steam demo</a>, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.</p>

<p>First off, I am an absolute sucker for Venetian carnivalesque trappings. This is partly to do with classic Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte">Commedia dell'arte</a> tropes like the Zanni, partly from the miniatures game <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/carnevale/opinion/carnevale-miniatures-game-assassins-creed-cthulhu">Carnevale</a>, and partly from Thomas Ligotti’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Grottesco_(book)">Teatro Grottesco</a>. It’s such fertile stuff for horror and fantasy, and I’m always delighted to see it pop up in games. The actual game is fairly taut and humble pixel art, albeit with the occasionally wild background feature, like a very large person emerging from a hole in the ground. The character art, conversely, reminds me of Supergiant games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pyre">Pyre</a>, and even coming close to that is a lovely feat of doodling magnificence.</p>
<p>Your character, Luca, only moves by sliding, and always as far as possible in the given direction. Thus, you’ll need to block yourself with environmental obstacles to progress. You’ll also need to clear each screen of enemies before moving on, which you accomplish by sliding into them, preferably after collecting a weapon. There are hop-able pitfalls, timed spiked traps, and other hazards trying to ruin your slideathon. You can also get acquainted with lore-snippets by putting the extra legwork in to collect optional scrolls. The maps string together metroidvania-style, with new paths opening once you grab certain upgrades.</p>
<p>I can see this being a Marmite job, simply because it’s based so heavily around a certain type of puzzle, apparently<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/comments/1cr4s9g/hi_everyone_im_currently_developing_sliding_hero/"> inspired by Pokémon’s ice caves</a>. Still, there’s a lot of imagination here, and it does look to add new wrinkles and ideas the further you progress. Did I write about it just so I got to use the word ‘carnivalesque’? No, entirely no. Was that a massive factor? Look, it’s a good word!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Krafton, the publisher of survival horror game The Callisto Protocol, forced developer Striking Distance to release the game early.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the game's director Glen Schofield, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ">Dan Allen Gaming</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">PCGamesN</a>) in which he discusses problems during the game's development.

</p>
<p>
Krafton, known for publishing PUBG, insisted the game release three months earlier than Schofield wanted. As a result, two and a half bosses and three or four enemy types were cut from the game.

</figure>
<p>

Schofield discussed a positive relationship with Krafton at first, but it seems that gradually deteriorated.
</p>
<p>
"I wanted about three and a half more months," said Schofield. "I was led to believe that that was the way it was going to be. In October or September '21, I was told 'You're going to get the time. Put whatever you want into the game.' So I spent that Christmas holiday just designing and coming up with ideas with some of the guys. And then January comes around and some of the [Krafton] folks come over and they just said 'no no no. It's December 2022.'"
</p>
<p>
He continued: "It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner, because if I'd just kept it on the way it was going, I wouldn't have to add anybody. But if you want it done, that means I've got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here."
</p>
<p>
Production of The Callisto Protocol was also heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with 10 to 20 people a month getting sick for long periods of time. On top of that, 49 people resigned from the team in 2021. "We were devastated," said Schofield. "'21 was the worst year of development of my life."
</p>
<p>
While Schofield doesn't give a clear reason for Krafton's demands, it may have perhaps been due to the impending release of EA's Dead Space remake that was released in January 2023, a month after Callisto Protocol. 
</p>
<p>
As Schofield created the Dead Space series, the two games were in direct competition. Indeed, he admitted in the interview some of his ideas for Dead Space transferred over, including the prison setting.
</p>
<p>
The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused Krafton's share prices to fall. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance then laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities".

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-games-revenue-see-a-41-decrease-in-q2-2024-due-to-weal-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-performance.947766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League didn't stop at murdering beloved superheroes from the DC Comics Universe, it also dealt a serious blow to Warner Bros. Discover's games revenue.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q2/earnings-result/WBD-2Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf">financial report</a> for the second quarter of the fiscal year, the company confirmed that games revenue declined by 41% compared to last year in the three-month period that ended on June 30th due to the weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Considering the massively successful Hogwarts Legacy was released last year, a drop was to be expected, but probably not with this magnitude, although this isn't just as surprising, considering the reception of the live service game developed by Rocksteady.</p>
<p>The bad reception for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was totally deserved. The game published by Warner Bros. has a sprinkling of classic Rocksteady charm, but its many issues make it a title worthy of anyone's time only at a heavily discounted price, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>

		<p>Meta is set to shut down its first-party development studio Ready At Dawn, the company reportedly looking to slash its Reality Labs division budget by 20% in the coming two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/22/facebook-oculus-ready-at-dawn-buy/">Meta had acquired Ready At Dawn in 2020</a>, with their most recent game being 2021’s Lone Echo 2.</p>


<p>The news comes from an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios, seen by <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">Android Central</a>, though a Meta spokesperson later told them that the cuts were not specifically to “save money”, but so that Oculus Studios and&nbsp;make a “better long-term impact” in VR development. They also stated that this is not a sign of wider layoffs within the division.</p>
<p>This is deeply disappointing news on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, Ready At Dawn was once a PlayStation mainstay, having been founded in 2003 by former Naughty Dog developers and getting their first break with PSP spin-off Daxter. From there they produced a pair of very well received God of War games for PSP, before ramping up in their ambitions with PlayStation 4 exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-order-1886">The Order: 1886</a>.</p>
<p>That game, while an incredible technical showcase for the PS4, drew only moderate acclaim with critiques of its heavy use of QTEs, overly familiar cover shooting, and a short runtime – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review/">we awarded it a solid 7/10</a>. Unfortunately, that seemed to be the end of the line for Ready At Dawn with PlayStation, and while there were plans for a sequel (the story ended on a transatlantic cliffhanger), the studio had to diversify and find a new direction.</p>

<p>Ready At Dawn latched onto VR gaming just as it was coming to the fore, releasing sci-fi space adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/12/ready-at-dawns-oculus-rift-bound-lone-echo-gains-echo-arena-multiplayer/">Lone Echo for Oculus Rift</a> in 2017 and published by Oculus Studios. A Enders Game-like multiplayer mode Echo Arena was also featured, and available as a standalone game.</p>
<p>However, while Meta has increasingly focused on standalone VR with the Meta Quest line of headsets, Ready at Dawn never really made the same jump. Echo Arena was ported to Meta Quest, but when Lone Echo 2 arrived in 2021 it was only released for the PC VR Oculus Rift headsets. Not only that, but the popular Echo VR was shutdown in August 2023 with only a minimal explanation from Ready At Dawn.</p>
<p>Meta has said that they are encouraging Ready At Dawn employees to apply for roles elsewhere within Oculus Studios, and we hope that everyone is able to land on their feet as soon as possible.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> – Season of the Infernal Hordes has launched, the latest seasonal update bringing a new wave-based battles, Fell Priests to fight, and a whole host of new Uniques and legendary items to earn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Season of the Infernal Hordes | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVSeZrh_4rQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Lord of Hatred’s servants will emerge with the Infernal Hordes, a wave-based feature that you can take on after completing a Questline in World Tier III. You’ll be able to select Infernal Offerings – which are both a boon and a bane to augment your run – between each 60-second wave to optionally increase your enemy’s difficulty and final rewards. Each wave will see the number of enemies increase, and you’ll have a limited number of revives to fall back on, before eventually faving the Fell Council, which feature corrupted Priests that each comes with unique attacks – enemies last seen in Diablo II.</p>
<p>Through each run, you’ll collect Burning Aether, which are then used to unlock Spoils of Hell, should you make it to the end. Smash Soulspires and Aetheric Masses to grab Burning Aether – which is collected individually if you’re playing co-op – and while you won’t lose this resource between deaths, running out of revives will prevent you from getting any Spoils.</p>
<p>The Spoils of Hell can contain Legendary and Unique items, materials for masterworking, gold, and items featuring Greater Affixes. If you save even more Aether through a run, you can unlock the Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>

<p>Alongside this is the Seasonal Progression, which starts in World Tier 1 and 2 with the ‘Of Lambs and Wolves’ questline – Head to Zarbinzet and speak to Captain Cireska. This will help get you up to WT3 if you need it, where you can take on ‘The Eyes of the Enemy’.</p>

<p>Diablo IV was one of the biggest releases of last year, gaining a coveted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">9/10 review</a> from us with Gamoc saying, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>

At some point every proud ruler must ask themselves the question: what should I do with all this stupid, tiresome <em>civilisation</em> I've built? Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

The gist: you are Emperor Hong of the Crimson Empire. You are a very sad banana, having recently lost both your mother, the previous ruler, and your dear Empress. The Crimson Empire itself is a picturesque quagmire of argumentative nobles, upstart peasants and uncollected taxes. Your viziers are grumbling and neighbouring rival monarchs are weighing their chances, but all you want to do is mope in your sanctum.
</p>
<p>
You don't appear to have access to any professional grief counsellors, not even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">vampire with CBT training</a>. You do, however, have the ability to summon Yaoguai, or demons of the north, all of whom take the form of sultry, sinister monster ladies with upgradeable stats and characteristics.</p>
<p>They'll help you with your imperial duties, like going on diplomatic missions or, er, terrorising the smallfolk with curses. You can also sacrifice them for unspecified boons, preferably after improving your relationship with them to increase the ectoplasmic yields. Ultimately, you must decide whether to permit them to harvest your citizens in a Mephistophelian bargain for the return of your lost wife.
</p>
<p>
In broad strokes, the game looks to be a mixture of dating sim, visual novel and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>-style plucking at sumptuous, painted regional maps, which periodically cough up branching snippets of story quest. It forms a trilogy of My Lovely games, the others being My Lovely Wife and My Lovely Daughter, each also the story of a grieving man conjuring thirsty diablettes to wreak horrors or be sacrificed. I guess crazy widowers are GameChanger's house style.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052990/My_Lovely_Empress/">its Steam page</a>, the game takes heavy inspiration from East and Southeast Asia mythology. It certainly looks a treat, with visuals that remind me a little of Darkest Dungeon and Hades. The spooky ghost ladies are all teen-rated, but this possibly isn't SFW: expect "Infrequent Violence, General Mature Content, and Sexual Content."
</p>
<p>
It's out on 21st August. Anybody here played any of the other My Lovelies? How Lovely are they, exactly, on a scale of "inoffensive" to "gorgeous"? I do relish a calculatedly unpleasant spin on the management genre, which tends to skew anodyne.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be more or less on par with the Steam Deck, but software limitations could impact the system's performance heavily.</p>
<p>Commenting on the leaked specs of the next console from Nintendo during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games' Matthew Cassells provided some very interesting insights on the upcoming system. While its specs should put its performance almost on par with the Steam Deck, though the Switch 2's CPU's weaker single core could impact performance in certain scenarios, as we already heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">last month</a>, some decisions made on the software side of things could be very limiting. Console manufacturers include in their systems security processors and encryption that introduce limitations, and the same is likely happening with the new Nintendo console, especially considering how the Switch was hacked and even a working flash cart was released on the market not too long ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Nintendo Switch 2 could have some more limitations that few could foresee. For example, on the current system, a game cannot write too much data to prevent flash storage from getting worn out, which is a rather big limitation for certain types of games. The current console also has a strict patch size limitation, which can also be impactful.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 should be more than enough for the foreseeable future, as the 12GB of RAM shouldn't create problems if high resolutions are not targeted. However, more complex games using ray tracing or advanced Unreal Engine 5 stuff may require upscaling from some very low resolutions, resulting in blurry image quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intel Raptor Lake’s Failure Rate, PS5 Pro Performance, Switch 2 | Alderon Games | Broken Silicon 269" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkVSgix0L38?start=1459&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially unveiled. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind Games have announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> will launch on 17th October 2024, the horror game based on the popular film franchise coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riegOv5eRuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer shows a mixture of gameplay and cinematics, and how the game puts and emphasis on staying as quiet as possible. A bit tricky when you can accidentally knock into buckets, when a gantry can give out beneath your feet, and when needing to use an asthma inhaler.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-story-trailer-shows-off-snippets-of-noisy-gameplay/">Previous trailers</a> have shown a good deal more, including introducing the relationship between Alex, our asthmatic college student protagonist, and her boyfriend Martin. The two will have to survive together, and there’s some gameplay and narrative touches like them using basic hand and head communication to direct one another, while the world is daubed with messages saying not to scream even in the “safe” room, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s not all going to be silent, sneaky horror though, with high action moments that will involve cars, shotguns and alarms, which will absolutely bring those monsters right to where you are. Best to avoid those, eh?</p>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. This looks to be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game, though the trailer clearly plucked out some of the more action-y moments that put the Quiet Place monsters in frame. I’d expect the overarching pacing to be much more considered and slower paced, though.</p>

<p>We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1820794843171307903">thanks to a thread</a> by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the screens aren’t worlds apart from the <a href="https://youtu.be/sIjAKcmPSbM">most recent gameplay</a> shown off by Tectonic, but that’s unsurprising considering how near the game was to release. The character customisation does look sharper and more detailed from where I’m sitting though, and the birds-eye house shots and those of the surrounding area do seem a little more cohesive and crisp than previous looks. There are also many snazzy outfits, which I’m sure are a big part of the reason people play these games to begin with, although I personally do not feel represented in the lack of coffee-stained trackie bottoms.</p>
<p>“Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them,” said Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester<a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/"> at the time</a>. “However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop.”</p>
<p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” Wester said of the studio’s closure. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project, we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio.”</p>
<p>“Two weeks before launch we were told we wouldn't be launching, and just now that we've all lost our jobs,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208887303224606720/">wrote Delventhal on LinkedIn</a> the following day. "We were only informed of this via a public announcement. This industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch."</p>
<p>Again, I likely wouldn’t have spent much time with Life By You, but I was still interested in having a tinker. The Sims could do with a sizeable competitor, especially since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-devs-assemble-team-to-focus-on-fixing-bugs-and-upping-performance-updates-to-now-land-every-two-months">recent updates seem to have been plagued by bug woes</a>. So, yeah, bummed for you if you were looking forward to this, and it sounds like the team behind it deserved a lot better too. Paradox themselves have been no stranger to mishaps recently, having just slapped an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">indefinite delay</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> after parting ways with the original developer and handing it off to a new studio. Let’s hope it doesn’t meet the same fate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Game Science has released a fresh trailer for forthcoming action-RPG Black Myth: Wukong ahead of its release later this month.
</p>
<p>
The trailer gives an extended look at the world of the game, the combat and transformational abilities of the monkey protagonist, and the imposing bosses he'll face - from smaller enemies to colossal beasts.
</p>
<p>
You may want to skip the trailer if you're looking to go in completely spoiler free, but it's certainly worth a look to admire the dramatic production.

<p>

Black Myth: Wukong is set for release on 20th August across PC and PS5. With its basis in the classic novel Journey to the West, it's steeped in Chinese folklore.
</p>
<p>
However, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed</a> as it requires more time for optimisation and remains without a release date.

</p>
<p>
Chinese developer Game Science has also courted controversy following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">reports of misogyny at the studio</a>. When Eurogamer contacted the developer with regards to these reports, it declined to comment.

</p>
<p>
I've been hands-on with Black Myth: Wukong a couple of times: at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukongs-combat-could-surpass-the-souls-games">Gamescom last year</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-is-a-brilliant-boss-rush-but-is-it-a-soulslike">preview session more recently</a>.
</p>
<p>
I came away impressed with its visuals and boss battles, though it feels a little empty in the space between. 

</p>
<p>
Is it a Soulslike? Game Science calls it an action-RPG and appears keen to separate itself from FromSoftware's work, though it certainly has some of the trappings of the genre.

			<p>A few hours ago, NEXON revealed some news about its upcoming action RPG, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-is-a-single-player-action-rpg-based-in-the-dnf-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, which is set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe. First and foremost, we now know the game is tentatively slated for a 2025 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Additionally, the developers have shared two brand new videos. The first one is behind the scenes, with NEXON talking about the story background for The First Berserker: Khazan.</p>
<p><em>The game follows the story of Khazan, a legendary hero who embarks on a quest for revenge after his downfall. It takes place in a world reminiscent of medieval Europe, within the Pell Los Empire on the continent of Arad. Pell Los stood as the most powerful empire of its time, but its peace was shattered by the sudden arrival of Hismar, a fearsome dragon.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it's in troubled times that true heroes emerge. Khazan, the empire's great general, and Ozma, the greatest mage of their time, were close friends who joined forces to defeat Hismar and restore peace. Their victory made them beloved heroes amongst the people. However, their fame didn't sit well with everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>The emperor and some of the nobility felt overshadowed and envious, and this envy turned into resentment. The emperor felt that he alone should be admired and respected by the people. Driven by jealousy, the emperor framed Khazan and Ozma for treason. Ozma faced gruesome torture, having his eyes gouged out before being executed, while Khazan was banished to the snowy mountains after having the tendons in both his arms severed. This sets the stage for our story.</em></p>

Facebook and Oculus Rift owners <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/meta">Meta</a> are reportedly closing Ready At Dawn Studios, the outfit behind the excellent Echo VR and Lone Echo games, as part of wider reductions at the company's Reality Labs division.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

The report in question comes from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">Android Central</a>, who cite internal memos from Reality Labs. According to the site's Nicholas Sutrich, the closure is intended to ensure Reality Labs "stays within [its] new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a 'better long-term impact' in VR development". It follows a report from mid-July that Meta plan to cut Reality Labs' budget by 20% by 2026.
</p>
<p>
A Meta spokesperson also told the site that the reductions at Reality Labs aren't evidence of cuts to the number of first-party games on Quest VR headsets, and that Meta are still committed to VR development. Meta declared that Quest 3 sales are "exceeding their expectations" in the company's most recent quarterly earnings call last week.
</p>
<p>
While Meta have yet to release an official comment, former Ready At Dawn developers have been reacting to the news on social media and sharing memories of the studio. "Ready At Dawn gave me a visa to come to the USA after 3 months of fruitlessly looking for work back in the UK after my prior employer went bankrupt," <a href="https://x.com/wuffles/status/1821317227171475608">wrote</a> character technical artist Sol Brennan. "I came to the USA with nothing but $300 and two suitcases. And my job at Ready at Dawn. 10 years later, I have two(.5) GDC talks, several critically acclaimed games released under my belt, own my home and a wonderful supportive network of friends."
</p>
<p>
"I am eligible to be a US citizen this November," Brennan went on. "None of this would have happened if Ready At Dawn hadn't given me that chance. Although the American dream is propaganda... I can definitely say I'm living it."
</p>
<p>
Meta acquired Ready At Dawn for their Oculus operations in June 2020. The developers' Lone Echo is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">our favourite VR games</a>, but Ready At Dawn also have a proud history of porting Sony's God Of War and Jak &amp; Daxter series to portable PlayStations. Their original fantasy cover shooter The Order: 1886 was less well-received, but stood apart for its glossy period art direction and PS4-melting graphics technology. Critics I respect have described it as a cult classic. I've been meaning to give it a go - shame you can't find it on PC.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to everybody at Ready At Dawn who is now looking for work.

            <p>
Gaming revenue for Warner Bros. Discovery has declined by 41 percent year-on-year due to the "weak performance" of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
</p>
<p>
The decline was part of an overall four percent decrease across studio revenue (gaming, TV, cinema) as revealed in the company's latest quarterly earnings report.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. Discovery is still yet to give exact sales figures for Rocksteady's Suicide Squad game, though in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">earnings call in February</a> the company's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels stated the game had "fallen short of our expectations". Later, it was revealed the company took a $200m loss on the game.

<p>

Of course, a key reason for this drop is the immense success last year of Hogwarts Legacy. It was one of the best-selling games of 2023 and by January 2024 had sold over 24m copies. Many releases would pale in comparison.
</p>
<p>
Yet Suicide Squad's performance seems particularly poor. In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">reports emerged of a tumultuous development</a> due to a toxic culture of perfectionism and a constantly shifting vision. The game was delayed multiple times after an infamously disappointing showing at PlayStation's State of Play showcase in February 2023.

</p>
<p>
During the earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and president of global streaming and games JB Perrette were questioned on the "uneven performance" of its gaming sector.
</p>
<p>
Perrette impressed the importance of free-to-play games, while Zaslav noted the possibility of licensing the company's various franchises to other gaming companies (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios">IGN</a>).

</p>
<p>
"We know that our franchises, particularly in a world where the gaming industry launching brand new franchises is getting harder and harder for a number of reasons, including IDFA deprecation and more challenges with marketing and customer acquisition," said Perrette. 
</p>
<p>
"And that franchises like the ones that we have are in high demand, and can help in launching games. You still need a great game, and the reality is, we've had the unfortunate- in a short period of 12 months, we went from having the record year in 2023 with Hogwarts Legacy to unfortunately having the opposite side of that spectrum with Suicide Squad. And it is still the hit-driven nature of some of that business, but one of the areas we are particularly leaning into, which is about half of the $200 billion games business, is the free-to-play space."
</p>
<p>
This, Perrette said, led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-studio-player-first-games-acquired-by-warner-bros">company acquiring MultiVersus developer Player First</a>, as "strengthening our capabilities" in free-to-play games would provide "some more balance to our games business from the inevitably cyclicality of more console-based releases".

</p>
<p>
Zaslav added: "We have eleven studios here, and we have a lot of IP. And there's also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at. Because as JB said, we need to get bigger, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of."
</p>
<p>
Rocksteady recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze">launched the second season of Suicide Squad</a>, featuring Mrs. Freeze, though it's unclear if this has resulted in an increase in players.

</p>
<p>
Warner Bros.' next big console game will be its Wonder Woman project, developed by Monolith Productions with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-studio-supporting-wonder-woman-game">support from WB Games Montréal</a>. Warner Bros. has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-is-not-being-designed-as-a-live-service-game">confirmed it is not a live service game</a>.

			<p>This morning, Chinese developer Game Science shared the final gameplay trailer for the upcoming action RPG Black Myth: Wukong. The video shows the game's stunning world that players will get to experience in just twelve days from today.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> to the world nearly four years ago, in August 2020. Right away, it looked like a game worth following closely. In early 2021, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-new-trailer-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> a tentative 2023 launch window, but it proved too ambitious. Game Science had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-is-the-first-2023-game-to-be-delayed-to-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> it to 2024, but it also brought a playable demo at Gamescom 2023, giving everyone a taste of their project.</p>
<p>Eventually, the developers have decided on an August 20 launch date for PC and PlayStation 5. Originally, the game was slated to launch at the same time on Xbox Series S and X, but this version has since been delayed due to ongoing optimization.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will support the full scope of NVIDIA RTX technologies on PC, including ray tracing and DLSS 3.5. NVIDIA said:</p>
<p><em>In Black Myth: Wukong, full ray tracing increases the fidelity and quality of lighting, reflections, and shadows. Reflections on water reflect all surrounding details. Water caustics add further realism by accurately rendering the refraction and reflection of light. Fully ray-traced Global Illumination ensures that indoor and outdoor lighting is pixel-perfect, darkening areas where light is blocked or can't reach and realistically illuminating the world through light bouncing. In concert with the lighting system, contact hardening and softening fully ray-traced shadows are cast everywhere, rendering the tiniest shadows on leaves and pebbles, as well as those on geometry-rich buildings, the main character, and the giant bosses players must defeat.</em></p>

                <p>If you're in the market for new board games, Humble has you covered with its latest bundle.

Among the games on offer are Dune: Imperium, Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Scythe, all of which are playable on Steam. </p><h2>Humble Bundle: Board Game Night With Dire Wolf &amp; Friends</h2><ul><li>Dune: Imperium</li><li>Scythe: Digital Edition</li><li>Wingspan</li><li>Quilts and Cats of Calico</li><li>Terraforming Mars</li><li>Terraforming Mars: Prelude DLC</li><li>Terraforming Mars: Hellas and Elysium DLC</li><li>Everdell</li><li>Munchkin Digital</li><li>Root</li><li>Sagrada</li><li>50% off coupon for Root: The Riverfolk expansion</li><li>50% off coupon for Munchkin Digital: The Unnatural Axe expansion</li></ul><p>Like other Humble Bundles, the Board Game Night bundle comes with multiple tiers, so you can still get some great games even if you don't want to pay the full price. At the lowest tier, you'll pay $7 for Sagrada, Scythe: Digital Edition, and Root, along with a coupon to nab Root's Riverfolk expansion. Paying $10 adds Wingspan and Munchkin to the deal, as well as a coupon for Munchkin's The Unnatural Axe expansion. For $15, the bundle adds Terraforming Mars and its DLC, as well as Everdell. Finally, the $18 tier tosses in Quilts and Cats of Calico and Dune: Imperium.</p><p>Humble Bundles also always pair with a charity, with a portion of the proceeds for the Board Game Night bundle going to the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Worldwide Wildlife Fund</a>. You can choose how much you contribute to the charity, or opt to pay more than the top tier cost to increase your donation.</p><p>In Dune: Imperium, you'll use a combination of deck-building, worker placement, and strategy to try to take control of the Spice flow in Arrakis. Dune: Imperium exited early access in March, so it's still a fairly new release that regularly sells for its full $23 list price. Steam is currently selling it for an all-time low of $16, just two bucks less than the full board game Humble Bundle. Dune: Imperium bundled with eight other digital board games and more content for $18 total is quite the deal.

Wingspan won numerous awards when it first released as a physical board game in 2019, but the digital edition is superb, too. If you're interested in the physical board game, Wingspan is available at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWingspan-Strategy-Board-Game-with-Swift-Start-Pack%2F485178793%3Fathbdg%3DL1200%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-board-game-night-dune-imperium-wingspan-scythe%2F1100-6525612%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fstonemaier-wingspan-with-swift-start-game-pack%2F-%2FA-82006492&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-board-game-night-dune-imperium-wingspan-scythe%2F1100-6525612%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><p>Another standout is Scythe, which imagines an alternate history following World War I that's dominated by mechs as factions compete to try to take over a war-torn Europe.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oxygen-esports-boston-breach-shutdown/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recent reports have surfaced online pointing to a total breakdown at Oxygen Esports, the Kraft Sports-backed organisation that fields teams in a range of titles, including Call of Duty, Apex Legends, and VALORANT. It’s the parent company to the Call of Duty League’s Boston Breach, which this season put up one of the worst performances we’ve seen in the history of COD esports.</p>



<p>Lots of details are up in the air at present, but according to sources, Oxygen is laying off all staff and shutting down operations – this should, by association, also pull down Boston Breach, which is due to compete at the Esports World Cup in just a few days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-biting-the-dust">Biting the Dust</h2>



<p>Oxygen Esports was never particularly successful as an organisation – especially of late – but this is a crushing and sudden blow for the industry. It was a few days ago that the Rocket League scene was hit by a sudden cancellation of the Shift Summer League Playoffs mere minutes before they were supposed to take place – the root cause of this has now been revealed as Oxygen’s impending shutdown.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/esports/sources-oxygen-esports-to-cease-operations-and-lays-off-all-staff-2854984/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Dexerto</a>, it was confirmed by Boston Breach’s players that they’ve been ‘kicked out’ of the training facility operated by Kraft Sports at Patriot Place. They’ll still fly to Riyadh to compete in the Esports World Cup, but after that, the future is uncertain.</p>



<p>It’s anticipated that shareholders and senior staff will confirm the future of the brand by the end of the week, one way or another. Stay tuned to catch all the comments as they’re delivered. In the meantime, we’ve reached out to Oxygen Esports to see if we can expedite this information.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-players-profile-wipe-compensation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-players-are-compensated-for-%E2%80%98profile-wipe%E2%80%99-error-but-it%E2%80%99s-still-no-good.947625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-players-profile-wipe-compensation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that only a portion of players were impacted by the recent ‘profile reset’ malfunction. Those who were hit by the ‘accidental wipe’ have been compensated in-game with a substantial amount of money and boosts to their skills, but ultimately, they’re still without the progress they’ve accrued over the last six months, which for some equals hundreds of hours of play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-wipe">Just Wipe</h2>



<p>Here’s what Battlestate Games handed down instead of an apology for this devastating malfunction:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 million Roubles</li>



<li>50,000 USD</li>



<li>50,000 EUR</li>



<li>All Labs keycards</li>



<li>4 x Money Case</li>



<li>DSPT</li>



<li>Reserve Marked Keys</li>



<li>All skills LL45</li>



<li>All Traders maxed</li>
</ul>



<p>Even the compensation is now causing issues, as some players were wiped with a low-level, low-tier account and have now been granted an utter bounty in-game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The in-game compensation has been sent to all the players whose in-game profiles have been lost due to technical malfuction.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a></p>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1821290746852601926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Regardless of it being merely a week or two from ‘wipe’, it’s a huge imbalance that is having an impact on the game even now. The in-game trading system is in tatters as everything has become monumentally expensive.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many players were impacted, as Battlestate Games hasn’t been transparent about the issue – nor did the company apologise for the loss. Ironically, many players have expressed their dismay at <strong>the compensation</strong>, stressing that they’d rather have had their account wiped if <strong>this </strong>is the reward for having that happen.</p>

As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you – you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s Your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase/decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989.

In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The real-time mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends!

One evening, as rain falls outside, a group of men burst in, killing Yushin before Yui’s eyes. With nothing but his soul remaining, Yushin must fight tooth and nail, possessing any body he can on the quest to find his sister and uncover the truth behind her disappearance. With only seven days left before his soul fades away, can he save her in time? Transport yourself to feudal Japan in the last years of the Edo period, and experience a tale of rain and reincarnation, brought to life with striking new 2D visuals.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Soul-Shifting Showdowns</strong> – Lacking a physical form, you’ll need to shift your soul to other bodies on the quest to find your sister. Possession puts you in complete control of whoever and whatever you inhabit, giving you access to a variety of weapons and fighting styles.

Who will you speak to? How will you intervene? The decisions, and the outcomes, are all up to you.</li><li><strong>Inclement Intrigue</strong> – This human drama plays out against the rain-soaked backdrop of mid 19th century Japan, rendered in an evocative pixel style. In the somber world of <em>AMEDAMA</em>, beauty and darkness are two sides of the same coin.</li></ul><p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister. But with just seven days before his soul departs this world—can he save Yui in time?</p><p>This is a tale of rain, reincarnation, and revenge.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Development / Marketing:</strong> IzanagiGames</li><li><strong>Planning:</strong> Acquire</li><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> lack (<em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>, <em>Touken Ranbu</em>)</li><li><strong>Soundtrack:</strong> Yuko Komiyama (<em><a title="Series > Monster Hunter [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series)</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Can you ever have too much Batman in your life? Science says no, even if you're planning to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Omnibus-Peter-J-Tomasi/dp/1779529503?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this gigantic 1,648-page hardcover collection</a> of comic book stories based on Rocksteady's brilliant Arkham trilogy. Now available to preorder for $150 and scheduled to arrive on September 24, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Omnibus-Peter-J-Tomasi/dp/1779529503?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Batman: The Arkham Saga is an essential companion piece</a> for anyone who's a fan of the Arkham games developed by Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Montreal. And the new omnibus edition compiles the whole saga in one volume that may or may not require Batman levels of strength to carry around.</p><p>If the price sounds high, just tell yourself it only costs 11 cents per page, which is a pretty great deal. Joking aside, the omnibus could realistically be split into five volumes (at least) at $30 each, which sounds very reasonable. Also, Amazon frequently discounts books before launch, and you won't be charged for your preorder until it ships. If Amazon drops the price before then, which is a common occurrence for big comic book omnibuses, you will pay the lowest price offered since placing your order.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346044" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346044"></a><figcaption>Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg"></figure><p>With Batman: Arkham Asylum a smash-hit after it was released in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into. This omnibus collects all of the Arkham comic book backstories, from the Dark Knight's first years on the streets in Batman: Arkham Origins to the dark and deadly stories of Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis and everything in between. The full list for this collection includes:</p><ul><li>Batman: Arkham Asylum: The Road to Arkham</li><li>Batman: Arkham City #1-5</li><li>Batman: Arkham City: End Game #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight #1-12</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight Annual #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight: Batgirl &amp; Harley Quinn #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis #1-6</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight: Robin Special #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Origins Special</li><li>Batman: Arkham Unhinged</li></ul><p>These are all great mini-series and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games.</p><p>It's worth checking out how these games came together, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Rocksteady%C2%92s-Batman-Arkham-Asylum/dp/141971385X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and there is a superb book detailing all this work</a>, although it is pricey because it's out of print. Alternatively, there's nothing wrong with going back to the original source material, as you can grab<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fbatman-arkham-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Freturn-to-rocksteadys-batman-arkham-series-next-month-with-1648-page-comics-omnibus%2F1100-6525550%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Batman: The Arkham Collection on PC</a> for just $8.40 at Fanatical.</p><p>The collection includes Arkham Asylum, Arkham City City, and Arkham Knight--sorry folks, no Arkham Origins--and an 86% discount is hard to beat. Not only do you get a selection of games that have aged well, you're also getting all of their DLC and expansion pass content as well. If you're up for a replay, you can unlock some superb concept art, character models, and more with these games.</p><p>Batman: The Arkham Saga isn't the only upcoming 2024 omnibus or graphic novel featuring the Caped Crusader and his Gotham City foes. One of the highlights is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Batman-Arkham-Grant-Morrison/dp/1779526105?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Absolute Batman edition of Grant Morrison's and Dave McKean's Arkham Asylum</a></strong>, which unsurprisingly served as inspiration and lended its title to Rocksteady's first Batman game. Absolute Batman: Arkham Asylum releases later this month. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Batman-Dark-Knight-Master/dp/1779527500?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frank Miller's The Dark Knight: The Master Race</a></strong> will also receive the Absolute Batman treatment on September 17.</p><p>The premium Absolute Batman hardcover series is awesome, but it's not the only series where classic Batman stories are being reissued. DC is also re-releasing some stellar Batman books in collections dubbed DC Finest. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Year-One-Two-Various/dp/1779528353?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Batman Year One &amp; Two</a></strong> is the first book in the new DC Finest series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">AAA Game of Thrones games when?</h2></div><section><p>Batman. Justice League. Harry Potter. Looney Tunes. Game of Thrones. The list of intellectual property owned by Warner Bros. Discovery is massive, and an awful lot of it seems ripe for being turned into a video game. If you're thinking WB's been a little slow to leverage that library, it sounds like the company's leadership agrees, and is looking not just to make more of its own games, but to license out some of its biggest franchises to other game studios in the future.</p><p>Today on the Warner Bros. Discovery Q2 earnings, call CEO David Zaslav and president of global streaming and games JB Perrette responded to a question about the "strategic value" of games to Warner Bros. given recent "uneven performance". The company had just reported gaming revenue down 41% year-over-year due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">underperformance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> compared to Hogwarts Legacy's massive success last year. Does WB see games as a core part of its portfolio?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Seems like the answer is yes. Both Zaslav and Perrette explained that they wanted to grow the gaming business, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-says-it-plans-to-double-down-on-live-service-despite-suicide-squad-failing-to-meet-expectations">especially in the free-to-play space</a>, which Perrette says can help balance out some of the ups-and-downs of the cyclical console industry. That's part of why WB acquired Player First Games, developer of Multiversus, earlier this year.</p><p>Zaslav followed up by noting that not only did WB want to keep leveraging its eleven studios, but that there's "also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at."</p><p>Here's both of their answers in full below:</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery reported revenue of $9.7 billion for the quarter, but an overall net loss of $10 billion, $9.1 billion of which was due to impairment charges. The company also reported subscription services were up 3.6 million subscribers from last quarter, bringing its total to 103.3 million. </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
