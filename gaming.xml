<p>CFB 25 was drawing huge player numbers even before the game officially launched, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hits-2-million-players-before-official-launch/1100-6525147/" data-ref-id="1100-6525147">2.2 million unique players logged</a> during the game's four-day early-access period. That figure more than doubled in the first week after its full release on July 19, with 5 million unique players trying out the game--and that figure did not include an additional 500,000 players who checked it out via the EA Play trial.</p><p>CFB 25's launch comes at the tail end of what EA reports as a strong financial quarter. Although most of its figures are down from the corresponding period the year before, EA notes that certain metrics exceeded its own expectations for the quarter.</p><p>Despite some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-warns-of-known-issues-in-college-football-25-following-launch/1100-6525210/" data-ref-id="1100-6525210">early technical issues and inaccuracies</a> with certain players and team likenesses, CFB 25 has been critically well received.

                <p>The Xbox Series X and S will be four years old this year, and Microsoft's latest earnings call has revealed that its newest generation of consoles just aren't selling like they used to. While software and service sales have been strong, helped along by the massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">Activision acquisition</a>, hardware sales have seen a sharp decline.</p><p>In its Q4 earnings presentation for the 2024 fiscal year, Microsoft noted that its gaming hardware sales have decreased significantly, with a 42% decline compared to the same period last year. Despite this, the company's overall gaming revenue was up 44%, with a 61% increase in content and services revenue that Microsoft says was "slightly ahead of expectations." Both of these growth figures were positively impacted by the Activision purchase, Microsoft says.</p><p>The call also suggests that third-party content may not have performed as well as expected for Xbox in Q4, with Microsoft noting that "stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance."</p><p>Despite the sharp decline in hardware sales, the figures aren't likely to come as a shock for Microsoft--in fact, its future outlook notes that "hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year." To offset this continued decline, Microsoft is looking to its Activision purchase to continue to drive sales on the content side.</p><p>While Microsoft looks to be focusing increasingly on software sales and Game Pass as the key to its gaming business, with Activision only the largest of its recent publisher acquisitions, the company has still reaffirmed its commitment to the hardware business. Microsoft has a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">digital-only Xbox Series X</a> releasing in time for the holidays, and has also confirmed that it is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reaffirms-a-next-gen-xbox-is-on-the-way/1100-6524094/" data-ref-id="1100-6524094">the next generation of Xbox consoles</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/infinity-paradise-lost-trailer-and-rogue-ai-have-entered-chat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a huge week for Corvus Belli, the creators of the <em>Infinity</em> tabletop wargame. First, they announced an animated series set in the <em>Infinity</em> Universe, and then immediately followed up with launching their own AI Chatbot, Sibylla. We've also got our hands on the exclusive Kassad Event Exclusive Miniature that celebrates the announcement and we take a look at all below.</p>


<p>Announced at San Diego Comic-Con, <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> is an upcoming animated series set in the <em>Infinity</em> Universe. Originally a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide">tabletop wargame</a>, <em>Infinity</em> has had a full roleplaying game release, 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/aristeia-and-aristeia-prime-time-review">tie-in sports-based spin-off board games</a>, and a dungeon-crawling adventure game.</p>
<p>For those not aware, the <em>Infinity</em> universe is set in the future, with mankind living amongst the stars. While not in outright war, various factions of humanity occasionally come to blows over territory and resources, coupled with all kinds of shadow operations. Thrown into this, are the combined alliance of alien races, and the forces of a rogue AI, known as the Evolved Intelligence, ALEPH.</p>

The series’ voice cast includes actors Zehra Fazal (<em>Young Justice, Halo Infinite, Starfield</em>), Jason Spisak (<em>Arcane, Batman: Hush</em>), Raffi Barsoumian (<em>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Seal Team, The Code</em>), Abubakr Ali (<em>Grendel, Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</em>), Emily O’Brien (<em>Days of Our Lives, Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham</em>), Nick E. Tarabay (<em>Spartacus, Star Trek Into Darkness</em>) and Roshelle Simpson (<em>Gather by the Ghost Light</em>).</p>
<p>I've been playing <em>Infinity</em> since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power">JSA army pack</a> caught my attention in 2018, and have played several campaigns in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-rpg-review-core-rulebook">Infinity RPG</a>. The animation, and story details that we can see in the <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> trailer look to capture the feel of Infinity perfectly, and I can't wait to see more.</p>
<p>There's no release date for <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> yet, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Everyone who went to the <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> panel at SDCC last weekend, got hold of an Event Exclusive Miniature for Kassad, the main protagonist in the upcoming series, and featured heavily throughout the trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tetris made its way into Minecraft last month with a new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/line-tetris-add" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">add-on</a> that added Line-Clearing tools, colourful blocks and Tertimonsters. Now, through the latest DLC, Minecraft players can enjoy the classic game of Tetris and experience a unique twist within the Minecraft universe, adding a new layer of excitement to their gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the new DLC, players are in for an intriguing experience as they enter a Tetris Universe within Minecraft. The mission is to recover the stolen Tetriminos from a mischievous Tetrimonster. The journey begins with a round of 2D Tetris that transforms into a thrilling 3D dungeon filled with surprises and challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each Tetris game is unique, so players encounter a different dungeon every time. It would help if you strategically used the Tetriminos to create a path that guides you to the treasure and keeps you away from the traps. Along the way, you will encounter various puzzles, rewards to collect, and monsters to fight. You aim to reach the top, where new Tetriminos await you in the next dungeon.</p>



<p>For those who love the classic modes, the Tetris DLC for Minecraft offers a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Players can enjoy the original game in the lobby, setting new high scores in Marathon, Sprint, and Ultra modes, complete with SRS-compliant Tetrimino action. And the best part? The entire DLC, including the classic modes, is available for multiplayer fun. The DLC is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-tetris-dlc-on-rotation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now available for download</a> from the Minecraft Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In other news, the Minecraft movie<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is rumoured to have a creepy, too-realistic style</a>. Also, the game arrived for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-arrives-on-playstation-5-with-preview-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 through a preview version last month</a>. What are your thoughts on Minecraft’s new Tetris DLC? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
While "blown away" by the beach scenes in the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

'Technological change' obviously covers a lot of bases, and what counts as a "jump" varies by the player or at least, the hardware manufacturer trying to flog you a new graphics card. One day people are frenziedly associating "the next gen" with the absence of crawlspaces, the next it's all about whether the vegetation rustles when you shoot it.</p>
<p>To chuck my own hat into the ring, I'm grumpy about placing video game hardware on a timeline from less to more advanced - this kind of rigid teleological, market-driven thinking cancels out and buries a wealth of specific usages of technology for particular artistic ends. I also agree with BioWare's Mark Darrah that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blockbuster-games-are-in-the-grip-of-a-fidelity-death-cult-says-former-dragon-age-producer">chasing fidelity for its own sake is a "death cult"</a>. Still, I can see Vermeij's point that it's generally harder to screenshot the difference between, say, two sequels released in the past five years than two sequels released in the early noughties.
</p>
<p>
"It's harder to make the same step again because well the technology is moving much slower," Vermeij observed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpF3lMqgPSw">SanInPlay</a>. "Like, the difference between PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 was enormous, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is not that not that big, right. So you don't really have that technology jump to make things different and better. 
</p>
<p>
"So I think yeah, so I think GTA 6 is not going to be wildly different from GTA 5. I don't know, maybe they pulled it off, maybe it's amazing, but I think some people, their expectations might be a little too high. Because you can never have that jump, the jump from GTA 2 to GTA 3 was big, and from San Andreas to GTA 4 was very big. I don't think we can ever see a jump like that again."
</p>
<p>
Again, Vermeij is impressed by what he's glimpsed of GTA 6 nonetheless. Like fellow ex-Rockstar Mike York, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-trailer-is-how-the-game-is-really-going-to-look-not-cinematics-says-ex-rockstar-dev">posted his own reactions to the trailer in December</a>, he's mad keen on the NPC animations. "The scene that blows me away is the one on the beach where everybody seems to be doing something else," Vermeij enthused elsewhere in the SanInPlay interview. "Every character has got their own animation. I think that looks pretty amazing. But I don't think it is going to be wildly different from GTA 5. I think maybe people might be a little disappointed. But it's still going to be the best game out there."
</p>
<p>
Discussion of the supporting hardware aside, the interview includes some reflection on how Rockstar changed up their narrative and stylistic approach for GTA 4, introducing a more "serious" storyline about a migrant chasing the New York dream, and doing away with many of GTA: San Andreas's oddball flourishes, such as simulating the effects of over-eating.
</p>
<p>

"We had a lot of time to do that one, like three years," Vermeij recalled. "And we went crazy in all the features, like stupidly. We were like stealth and skydiving and all these bikes, articulated lorries - it was just ridiculous. And of course, the three cities. And then at the end of that, we thought 'OK that was dumb'. Because we didn't have to do it. We could do half of it and it would still be very good. So we knew for GTA 4, we had to make a big jump and work to make the animation better and the city better and all that stuff. So that's why we cut down the features on purpose. So that we could actually make it a much more polished, much more beautiful game. And then worry about the additional features later on."
</p>
<p>
All that notwithstanding, Vermeij prefers the preceding games for their more openly comedic tone. This is one reason he left Rockstar in 2009 (the others include wanting to relocate with his family, and wanting to work for a smaller team again). "The [opening] trilogy, I thought those games were just tons of fun," Vermeij said. "I really enjoyed them. And then we made 4, and to my mind, it was a little too serious, too dark, too depressing almost. So when I decided to leave after GTA 4, it was like a number of things. One of them was like, my wife's Canadian and she wanted to move back to Canada. But also, I thought GTA 4 wasn't as good and as fun as the games before. And I thought that the next one was going to be like, even darker. I'm happy to see that I was wrong. GTA 5 is a lot more lighthearted than GTA 4. So I got that wrong."
</p>
<p>
Vermeij feels that GTA needed to become more "realistic" to wow the punters, comparing Rockstar's on-going successes to other games that have tried to continue the tradition of "crazy, wild" GTA (he doesn't mention Saints Row, but it's the obvious elephant in the room). "And, you know, they didn't do that well either. So I think it was the right move to make it more serious. But at the same time, I sort of miss the old games still." He's hopeful that GTA 6 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-style adventure in Vice City, GTA's version of Miami</a> - will keep things relatively light and silly.
</p>
<p>
"I love the Miami vibe. I think that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Miami Man theme</a> where people just do stupid stuff, and the alligators and sitting on cars and everything - I think that suits GTA very well. So yeah, it's going to be a good game for sure." Vermeij also speculates that Rockstar might have access to "pretty new technology having to do with animation and AI and all that stuff", remarking in closing that that "I think there's definitely time for a revolution where animation is maybe not hand-animated anymore, but it would be more AI-driven and physics-driven." He doesn't go into detail and I'll refrain from extrapolating, because I can never quite decide what "hand-animated" means or has meant.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Vermeij has held forth on all things GTA. Last year, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-once-planned-a-zombie-island-survival-game-using-gta-vice-city-code-but-it-was-too-depressing">aired a few cancelled Rockstar projects on his blog</a>, though he has since deleted these posts after current Rockstar developers expressed their displeasure. He still puts out the odd development titbit on <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij">Xitter</a>. GTA 6, meanwhile, is coming in 2025, though <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-thrilled-to-share-gta-6-with-players-everywhere-but-no-pc-release-date-yet">Rockstar have yet to pin down a PC release date</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Star Wars Outlaws team has devised a solution to <em>that </em>'yellow paint' debate.</p>
<p>Many video game developers have introduced yellow paint into their games, as a way of signposting players where to go next. Not sure where to climb? Look for the yellow scuffs on the cliff side. If it's a building, maybe look out for a yellow drainpipe or window ledge. Resident Evil even features yellow locks for players to pick.</p>
<p>Needless to say, yellow paint - or indeed any brightly coloured marker - is a pretty common occurrence across the video game landscape. It is a useful accessibility tool for many players. And, this same paint-based path finder also features in Star Wars Outlaws. That is, unless you don't want it to.</p>

<p>At a press event earlier this month, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/star-wars-outlaws-will-finally-let-us-turn-off-that-annoying-yellow-paint-on-every-climbing-surface/">PC Gamer</a> confirmed that the upcoming Star Wars game will include an 'Explorer Mode' for those who, quite simply, want to turn off the guiding colour markers.</p>
<p>Reporter Morgan Park said they didn't get the chance to experience Outlaws in Explorer Mode during the preview, but they would probably use it on the game's release, as the yellow paint otherwise was quite prominent, particularly during climbing sections and puzzles.</p>
<p>It bears saying, Star Wars Outlaws is by no means the only game to allow players to toggle a guiding colour on or off.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which was released back in 2018, offered players the chance to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-lets-you-independently-adjust-difficulty-of-puzzles-traversal-and-combat">independently adjust difficulty for puzzles, traversal and combat</a>. Flick traversal to easy, and white marks would show up on the path Lara should take. Scale the difficulty up to harder modes, however, and those handily painted points will be gone.</p>
<p>But, even with these games giving players the option to curate their guidance experiences, the yellow paint debate has been ongoing for many, <em>many </em>years. Most recently, in February of this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-demo-players-are-arguing-about-yellow-paint">demo for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth got players in a bit of a tizz</a> due to that sunshine yellow colour being splashed across rock faces. </p>
<p>Hopefully Outlaws' Explorer Mode will placate those who prefer to make their leaps of faith a little less obvious.</p>
<p>For more, our Ian recently went hands on with Star Wars Outlaws, and enjoyed his experience with the game. "It's not quite the Star Wars GTA that a lot of people were hoping for, but if you're after a familiar, inoffensive bit of Star Wars, I don't think this one will miss the mark," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-being-a-blatant-mix-of-all-things-ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws-feels-like-a-proper-star-wars-adventure">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is making incredible progress and is now capable of running a game at playable framerates that it could only boot a few days ago.</p>
<p>As seen in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, the PlayStation 4 emulator can now run Red Dead Redemption Remastered at around 25 frames per second on a high-end system. While this may not seem very impressive, it actually is, considering that the emulator was only capable of launching the game a few days ago. With how quickly things are progressing, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game running at 30 FPS and above in the next couple of days.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 Emulator Progress | Red Dead Redemption | Shadps4 v0.1.1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7P_z59j0HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it is clear that there's still a lot of work left to be done, as the emulator is only capable of running decently <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-progress-red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple 2D games</a>, there's no denying that the ShadPS4 emulator is becoming more and more the PlayStation 4 emulator to follow. While it is only capable of launching Bloodborne as of now, the day it will be able to run the game and finally release it from the PlayStation 4 prison it is currently being held into may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator can be found <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The Game Boy is one of the most-successful gaming systems ever, having sold 118.69 million copies across all its variants (including the Game Boy Color). In Japan and the US, it was the first platform for one of the most-popular games of all time: Tetris. It launched the Pokemon franchise, which has since grown to massive proportions. And all of this combined to start Nintendo's handheld empire. Nevertheless, the Game Boy appeared to have some drawbacks at first. It was small, if bulky. It was deliberately less advanced than its handheld competitors at the time. Its limited color palette and sound board meant it had to lean on careful, deliberate abstraction. In other words, to be legible, exciting, and appealing, the Game Boy had to get weird. It was an outsider. And on the outside, strangeness flourishes.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the best example of this weirdness is The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The game was originally an after-work project to port A Link to the Past to the Game Boy, as there was no intention to create an original Zelda title for the system. Eventually, the project flourished into a full, unique game of its own. Director Takeshi Tezuka <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Spirit-Tracks/Iwata-Asks-Zelda-Handheld-History-/2-Kirby-and-Chomps-in-Zelda/2-Kirby-and-Chomps-in-Zelda-233781.html">even described the game as a "parody" of Zelda games proper</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That statement undersells the game's relentless strangeness. One of the game's explicit inspirations was Twin Peaks, which broadcast in Japan in 1991. Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost even met with Nintendo to discuss the television show and bringing its sensibilities to video games, something we only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24078662/twin-peaks-zelda-links-awakening-influence" rel="nofollow ">discovered this year</a>. Link's Awakening borrows the idea of a small town with a surreal populace, though it cranks the absurdity up from . Link is far away from Hyrule, having crash-landed on the mysterious island of Koholint. The game's initial hours play as a comedy where, in attempting to find a way off the island, Link must help the town's inhabitants live their lives. He walks their pets, shops for them, and does the more regular Zelda activities of solving puzzles, braving dungeons, and fighting bosses.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the game continues, the darkness on its edges grows. The whole island is a dream. Upon waking the Whale Fish, whose gigantic egg sits in the island's central volcano, Link will wake up. The island, and everyone he has gotten to know on it, will vanish. It is still one of the medium's most profound and haunting meta-narratives. All video games are miniature worlds that vanish when we are not looking at them, only brought to life through our interaction with them. Link's Awakening dramatizes that dynamic, making it a poignant story of enveloping loss.</p><p dir="ltr">In lighter terms, the game also brings in homages to a variety of other Nintendo games. It features goombas, piranha plants, chain chomps, and a Kirby-like enemy, among others. That kind of cross-band pollination is commonplace now, but at the time, it was somewhat subversive-- not merely an Easter egg, but a satiric dilution of the oh-so-important Zelda Brand. To this day, Nintendo remains quite protective of its IP--Mario hasn't appeared in Fortnite, after all. The justification for this approach in Link's Awakening, according to Tezuka, was, "It was for the Game Boy, so we thought, 'Oh, it'll be fine.'"</p><p dir="ltr">That statement is deliciously revealing. The Game Boy was a platform on which you could get away with things: where the possibility space was just a little wider. While more ubiquitous than its companion consoles, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo 64, it was also less of Nintendo's flagship. It was less able to create images that would foreground marketing. To this day, Link's Awakening is an outlier spin-off of one of Nintendo's core franchises. It stands apart from every other game in the storied series.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda was not the only Nintendo franchise to get this kind of gentle subversion on Game Boy. Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins was the first game to feature Mario's evil twin, Wario. He started as a villain but became an anti-hero by his next appearance in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. Wario would go on to be folded fully into the franchise's language, but the off-the-wall antics of something like WarioWare still make him an outsider. Turning Mario into a cackling, greedy anti-hero is not blasphemous, but it is at least cheeky.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOZCT3rUA38" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NOZCT3rUA38" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is far from the only company whose games on the Game Boy got existential. Saga, or Final Fantasy Legend as it's known in the US, follows four warriors as they climb a mystical tower. Each level of the tower, much like the Dark Tower in Stephen King's series of the same name, is host to a different world. Fittingly, Final Fantasy Legend has an epic scale and tasks you with traversing multiple worlds, killing gods, and combating oppressive regimes. However, it is also bare, without party-member characters. You pass through each world almost as quickly as you arrive and there is nary a hint of what will occur once you leave.</p><p dir="ltr">This barebones approach does resemble the original Final Fantasy, but even more than that, Final Fantasy is a game about preventing the end of history: a hard point where time ceases. Its world has a long past, full of ancient civilizations and long-lost technologies. In Saga, there is a feeling of each world being in total stasis until you arrive. They each have their own plot that only you can interrupt. The final reveal--that a powerful god created the tower and its worlds for his own amusement--is hardly out of step with the RPG mold, but Saga's simplicity makes that feel wholly frightening and existential. Like Link's Awakening, the world seems to be someone else's dream that will vanish upon waking. Saga's tower may not have a history, but it does have a future. With god dead, the peoples of the tower can make their own choices, but their freedom only begins after the credits roll.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>Some of the limitations of the Game Boy are shown in the name itself. Nintendo, like most every other console manufacturer, was running with the assumption that its audience was boys and young teenagers. It's hard to say that wasn't true, but despite the name, those assumptions were both bent and broken, sometimes with Nintendo's outright encouragement. Plenty of moms played Tetris and plenty of young girls played Pokemon. There is a traceable line from the Game Boy to Beyoncé's pink DS campaign, and later to the presentation of the Wii and Switch as family devices for everyone. The Game Boy's simplicity was the entry point.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Since the Game Boy, the margins it represented have both expanded and shrunk. Small, weird games are plentiful on platforms like Itch.io. Some of these projects are even Game Boy games, meant to be played with emulators. Link's Awakening has its own aesthetic lineage, seen in independent games like Undertale and Anodyne. Nintendo has only one flagship handheld/console hybrid now, and that is not likely to change in the future. Its brands have flattened somewhat, with every Mario sports and party game having the same basic aesthetic, repeated ad infinitum. It is hard to imagine Nintendo publishing an after-work project now, and any such project would be more likely to become an indie game on its own terms, rather than an outlier classic within a larger franchise. It's hard to say if that's good or bad, but the Game Boy still represents something unique, never to be exactly replicated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dome-keeper-just-got-a-massive-update-that-ups-replayability-and-helps-generate-better-worlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Katharine (RPS in peace) thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper's</a> blend of tower defence and mining was both "meditative" and "perfectly formed" in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dome-keeper-review">review</a>. So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Entitled "A Keeper's Duty", the aim of the update is to provide "more run variety and bigger replayability". Take new Guild Assignments, which are essentially special challenge runs. You'll pick an assignment with special conditions and goals, like landing on a planet that has "only monsters shooting projectiles", and you've got to figure out how to deal with the twist. Complete assignments and you'll earn badges, which you can then spend on permanent rewards: being offered three instead of two gadgets, being able to reroll gadget offers, and more.</p>

<p>There's a new "Droneyard" primary gadget that helps eliminate the bore of carrying resources from the mines to your dome, as drones will do it for you instead. The yard also generates two form of drone: combat and parasitic, with the former firing missiles and the other latching onto enemies and making them more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>As for those new monsters, there's one called the breeder that continuously spawns new ticks. If you shoot it, it'll harden for a bit and make life more difficult. Otherwise, there's a new glass cannon called the tormentor that fires a massive laser but transforms into a squishy bastard when charging up. Timing is critical then, as you need to blast it when in this vulnerable state, lest you get cooked.</p>
<p>Thanks to a big engine update (moving from godot 3 to 4), the game now has better map generation. Before there were lots of blob-shaped maps, now there will be maps of many more shapes and sizes, with new interesting structures.</p>
<p>There's an absolute tonne of extra changes I could cover here, but won't because it'll turn into a day-long endeavour. You can view them all over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/">Steam</a> if you're keen to soak it all in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft's continued decline in Xbox console sales continued through the last financial quarter, the company has confirmed.
</p>
<p>
In what is now a familiar pattern - and one not limited to Microsoft - revenue from gaming hardware fell again, this time by 42 percent. That's down further on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet">31 percent fall reported back in April this year</a>, for the quarter before.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's gaming revenue overall was up overall by 44 percent, thanks to a significant boost from the addition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft bought for $68.7bn</a> before its latest round of layoffs. Without Activision, growth would have sat around three percent.

<p>
All of the big three consoles are seeing sales drop. Xbox Series X/S will pass its fourth anniversary this November, and it's expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft will launch refreshed models of its console range around the same time</a>.  Sony's rival PlayStation 5 is of a similar age, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">reports suggest a souped up PS5 Pro model is also on the horizon</a>. Nintendo, meanwhile,  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">will unveil Switch 2 before next April</a>.
</p>
<p>
But Microsoft suggested it knows it must do more than simply launch new consoles to continue growing its gaming sector. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said the company's strategy so far had been to build up content pipelines for players on Xbox consoles. Next, it wanted to ensure this content was being delivered wherever people play games, such as on PC, smartphone and cloud - such as the recent addition of Xbox to Amazon Fire TV.
</p>
<p>
"The real goal here is to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and build something that looks more like, to us, a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP which is quite valuable long-term," Microsoft exec Amy Hood said. "We're encouraged by the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass."
</p>
<p>
On a rosier note, Nadella painted the results as a picture of overall growth, and pointed to a strong pipeline of game launches over the next year including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in October. 
</p>
<p>
Nadella also noted the impact of Amazon's Fallout TV series on Bethesda's back catalogue of Fallout RPGs, available to play on Xbox Game Pass. "Hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly five times quarter-over-quarter," Nadella revealed - lining up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">the boost noted by Fallout boss Todd Howard</a> back in May.

Image credit: Nexon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>There are various changes to the way the game works, too. For example, Nexon has blocked equipping and removing modules, changing presets, and changing loadouts to prevent module swapping from becoming a strategy in Intercept Battles and Infiltration Operations.</p><p>Alongside the release of the 1.0.5 patch, The First Descendant director Minseok Joo outlined the development team’s plans for issues that are much-discussed within the game’s community. Minseok Joo confirmed plans to introduce a “guaranteed drop” system where players will be guaranteed to get the item they want after repeating an activity a certain number of times, in response to complaints about “the vagaries of drop rate.”</p><p>“The First Descendant has various missions and Amorphous Materials with chance-dependent rewards,” Minseok Joo said. “We're considering how we can effectively implement the ‘guaranteed drop’ in such diverse reward systems, and we're working to create a farming structure that players will be happy with. We hope to make improvements before long to provide a more rational and satisfying farming experience.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/image202407311736186-1722416031260.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Luna. Image credit: Nexon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Elsewhere, Nexon is planning a system to dismantle leftover items to get byproducts, and a rotating shop system where you can exchange the byproducts for something of value. “This will allow the items you obtained to have a greater value in the game,” Minseok Joo said.</p><p>Minseok Joo also discussed balancing, admitting “we can't promise that all Descendants and weapons will be equally balanced at all times.” However, Nexon intends to keep changing the “effective” builds. “To that end, we promise to make constant adjustments and offer different ways to play with new content.”</p><p>These improvements will be made to the game during Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies"><u>with over 10 million players in just 10 days</u></a>. But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters. IGN has reported on one player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-community-reacts-in-disbelief-as-one-player-grinds-for-200-hours-to-unlock-every-ultimate-descendant"><u>who spent an eye-watering 200 hours to unlock every Ultimate Descendant currently available in the game without paying money</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/image202407311736187-1722416132706.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hard Difficulty Void Intercept Battle, Gluttony.

<strong>Content Improvements</strong><br>(1) UI/UX<br>- To prevent module swapping from becoming a strategy in Intercept Battles and Infiltration Operations, equipping and removing modules, changing presets, and changing loadouts are now prohibited.<br>- Added a feature to collect all Lost and Found items at once in the Mailbox.<br>- After checking the map with acquired information in the Library, closing the map now leaves the Library open.<br>- Added Camera Shake ON/OFF feature in Game Options.<br>- (PS, Xbox) Added the ability to select preset search keywords to make it easier to search modules and research.<br>- Added commas after every three digits in the game menu and HUD to make it easier to read numerical units.<br>- You can now check key stat information in the weapon, reactor, and external component inventories.<br>- You can now register equipped items as Attached Items.<br>- Saving a preset now automatically registers equipped items as Attached Items.<br>- You can now turn the red dot crosshair display on or off cities in Game Options.<br>- Added an image to some items in Graphics Options to show what they do.<br>- Increased the speed of scrolling when scrolling the map with the gamepad's R-stick.<br>- Changed the color of icons for Hard difficulty Void Intercept Battles on the World Map to make it easier to distinguish them from Normal difficulty battles.<br>- The map no longer displays the marker when a quest NPC being tracked disappears.<br>- The Modification Modules for the same Descendant are now displayed together in a row in the Library.<br>- When the first clear reward and repeat clear reward are the same, the Acquisition Info in the Library no longer shows them both.<br>- When selecting all duplicate modules in Dismantle Modules, you can now use a filter to register only the selected modules for dismantling.<br>- Simplified the module combining animation.<br>- Starting a research in the Materials tab of the Research menu now returns you to the Materials tab.<br>- Added the "Leave Party" button to the Social menu to make the function easier to find.<br>- Added a search function to the Consumables menu.<br>- Even when acquiring skins for Descendants not currently in use the red dot still appears.<br>- Added the red dot when acquiring paint.<br>- The red dot now appears in the Weapons List side tab too when acquiring a weapon skin.</p><p>(2) Descendants, Modules<br>- Increased the Poison contagion range of Freyna's Room 0 Trauma from a 4 m radius to a 7 m radius.<br>- Increased the maximum scaling range of Valby's skills from 200% to 250%.<br>- Increased the maximum scaling range of Blair's skills from 200% to 250%.<br>- Changed the blizzard generated by Viessa's "Glacial Cloud" module to be triggered instantly without delay.<br>- Changed Valby's "Albion Academy Cadet" head skin to be dyeable.<br>- Changed "Incoming Final Damage" to "Incoming Damage Modifier" in the description of the "Safe Recovery" module.</p><p>(3) Equipment<br>- Added a feature in Game Options that enables some single-shot and burst weapons to fire automatically when the fire button is pressed and held down.<br>- Increased Enduring Legacy's Critical Hit Damage from 1.7x to 2.3x.<br>- Increased Secret Garden's Critical Hit Rate from 35% to 50% and Critical Hit Damage from 1.85x to 2.25x.<br>- Increased Nazeistra's Devotion's Critical Hit Rate from 36% to 45% and Critical Hit Damage from 2x to 2.25x.<br>- Decreased the trigger rate of Bombardment of Greg's Reversed Fate, but now it also triggers when the weapon is fired at unshielded enemies.<br>- Equipment can now be dismantled at once with no quantity limit.</p><p>(4) Field<br>- Increased the amount of Void Shards that can be acquired from Special Operations by about 7 times.</p><p># Director's Comment<br>Hotfix 1.0.4 added Void Shards as rewards to Special Operations, but unfortunately, there were just too few. The original intent was to keep Void Fragments as the primary farming source for Void Shards, and get additional Void Shards from Special Operations.</p><p>But the community has told us that many of you don't like this loop, so we've increased the amount of Void Shards that can be earned in Special Operations. We're also working on some steps for future improvements.</p><p>Many players are currently farming materials without spending the Fragments at the Fusion Reactor, so we're considering removing the Fragments from the Fusion Reactor startup altogether. This would make the Fragments necessary only when the Reconstructing Device is used at the Fusion Reactor.</p><p>We're taking a close look at how the reward loop we planned works in practice. We'll try to finalize a reward loop that players will be satisfied with in the near future.<br>- Reduced the distance you're knocked down when hit by a trap.<br>- Lowered the ratio at which the named monster's immunity sphere HP scales with the number of players in Infiltration Operations, and reduced the duration of immunity.<br>- The Agna Desert, Vespers, Echo Swamp, White-night Gulch, Hagios, and Fortress fields now have a 100% chance to spawn Encrypted Vaults at spawn.<br>- Increased the hit box size in "data collection" missions to make it easier to collect data.<br>- Outside environmental sounds are now less audible in the indoor areas in Kingston.<br>- Adjusted the distance that monsters spawn in the Laboratory to be closer as 15m.</p><p>(5) Miscellaneous<br>- Balanced sound levels for shield destruction notification, material research result window, etc.</p><p>Optimization Improvements<br>- (PC, PS5, XSX, XSS) Applied AMD FSR 3.1.<br>- (PS4, XB1) Optimized memory usage.<br>- (PS4, XB1) Optimized resolution to increase the maximum resolution by at least 5%.<br>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br>(1) UI/UX<br>- Fixed an issue where enemies defeated by the unique effects of Ultimate Weapons were not counted in Battle Pass Challenge and Awards.<br>- Fixed an issue where the capacity cost reduced by matching socket types was not displayed on the Weapon Module Enhancement screen.<br>- Fixed an issue where closing the Capacity Exceeded warning message while enhancing a module made the game inoperable.<br>- Fixed an issue where restarting an Intercept Battle, Infiltration Operation, or Special Operation after completing it would not matchmake you with allies who applied to restart with you.<br>- Revised the description on the Info screen that incorrectly stated that the damage taken decreases the higher the "Incoming Damage Modifier," so that now it states the damage taken decreases the lower the modifier.<br>- Fixed an issue where completing a mission with a weapon that has been socketed at least once would appear to give Mastery Rank EXP, when in fact it does not.<br>- Fixed an issue where the names of the core materials and blueprints of Ultimate Weapons were swapped.<br>- Fixed an issue where the quantity of attached paint was not displayed in the Mailbox.<br>- Fixed an issue where the DBNO UI animation would persist when a DBNO ally left and another ally joined.<br>- Fixed an issue where changing loadouts while in combat is not possible but the UI would switch to the selected loadout.</p><p>(2) Descendants<br>- Fixed an issue where Lepic could trigger the "Overkill" skill at 0 MP while equipping the "Increased Efficiency" module.<br>- Fixed an issue where Yujin could not target an ally when using "Solidarity Healing" if part of their body was covered by an object.<br>- Fixed an issue where DBNO allies rescued by Yujin could not use any skills for a short period of time after the rescue.<br>- Fixed an issue where switching weapons after using Viessa's "Frost Road" skill caused the skill's visual effect to remain.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Knockdown range of Valby's "Plop Plop" skill was larger than the actual Skill Range.<br>- Fixed an issue where Enzo's "Shoot Support" was not applied to allies.<br>- Fixed an issue where using Ultimate Gley's "Massacre" or "Life Siphon" skill did not increase her Skill damage when she is above 50% HP.<br>- Fixed an issue where Gley's "Life Siphon" skill and her Modification Modules "Massive Sanguification" and "Explosive Life" could be used on objects in Intercept Battles.<br>- Fixed an issue where Kyle's "Repulsion Dash" could be used on objects in Intercept Battles.<br>- Fixed an issue where the skill animation of Kyle's "Repulsion Dash" skill would intermittently be cancelled.<br>- Fixed an issue where the power of Ultimate Bunny's "Lightning Emission" was determined by the amount of Electricity she had at the time of use, unlike Bunny. The power of Bunny's "Lightning Emission" depends on the amount of Electricity she currently has.<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny's "Maximum Power" skill's sound pitch went up infinitely and sounded like a noise.<br>- Fixed an issue where Esiemo would become uncontrollable while using the "Arche Explosion" skill.<br>- Fixed an issue where after Ultimate Viessa used "Frost Road" with the "Absolute-Zero" module or Valby used "Laundry Bomb," Ajax placing a barrier on top of it inflicted reflective damage on Ultimate Viessa or Valby.</p><p>(3) Equipment<br>- Fixed an issue where moving on a field with three or four pieces of an external component set prevented the 2-piece set effect from being applied.<br>- Fixed an issue where the damage of hitting the Ultimate Weapon King's Guard Lance after it was deployed was recorded in the statistics.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Ultimate Weapon Executor's Hip Fire Accuracy was lower than what it should be.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Ultimate Weapon Thunder Cage's unique effect would deal more than 1.33x damage when monsters were clustered. Instead, Electric Shockwave now deals 2x damage regardless of the number of enemies.</p><p># Director's Comment<br>During internal testing, we discovered a bug with Thunder Cage. Thunder Cage should always deal 1.33x damage according to its description, but it was dealing more than 1.33x damage when there were a lot of monsters. We fixed this bug, but we also boosted the 1.33x damage to 2x so that it doesn't become less efficient when hunting.</p><p>We're well aware that the value of items you own is important to you. To ensure that fixing the bug doesn't devalue your items, we've given it more power than we originally intended. If something like this happens again in the future, we won't stop at simply fixing the bug but consider how to preserve the value of your items to provide a reasonable patch.<br>- Fixed an issue where you could hear one or two extra shots when firing single shots with a repeating firearm.</p><p>(4) Modules<br>- Fixed an issue where the Firearm Critical Hit Rate increase effect was missing in the description of Valby's "Supply Moisture" module.<br>- Fixed an issue where Valby's "Tidal Wave" module would not properly stack Finishing Attack when piercing an enemy.<br>- Fixed an issue where equipping Ajax's "Body Enhancement" module would have different final result values depending on when it was saved.<br>- Fixed an issue where if the "Matrix Recomputation module" was equipped by Ajax the Shield would recover every time after a very short while and the Shield started at 50% after equipment.<br>- Fixed an issue where the "Pitmaster" passive would remain indefinitely when Blair removed the "Classic Chef" module while Flame Zone was in effect.<br>- Fixed an issue where the knockback effect would not trigger when Blair used "Deadly Cuisine" while equipped with the "Backdraft" module.<br>- Fixed an issue where the name of the "Sharp Precision Shot" module's buff was incorrectly shown as "Lethal Finish."<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny's Evolving Skin quest requirements were not counted when Bunny equipped a Modification Module.<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny unequipping the "Electric Condense" module left a status effect display that did not have any effect.<br>- Fixed an issue where Gley's "Predator Instinct" module skill displayed the Frenzied state icon and name twice when used.<br>- Fixed an issue where Ultimate Gley's "Demonic Modification" module sometimes did not deal damage when used.</p><p>(5) Field<br>- Fixed an issue where defeating named monsters at the same time as Void Fusion Reactor mission was being deleted allowed the player to use Reconstructing Devices without consuming Void Shards.<br>- Fixed an issue where the zone map of "Hagios: The Old Mystery" showed different paths from actual paths.<br>- Fixed an issue where the traps would remain on restart after dying in the No Resurrection Zone in Hagos: The Haven.<br>- Fixed an issue where movement markers would appear while progressing through the Void Fusion Reactor.<br>- Fixed an issue where roaming monsters would not spawn on the White-night Gulch: Hatchery battlefield.<br>- Changed the Amorphous Material Patterns and Shape Stabilizers acquired from Hard Infiltration Operations in the White-night Gulch and Hagios.</p></div><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/a060afc832a322a1e5f810aade460814faca153f-1722416433501.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><div><p>(6) Miscellaneous<br>- Fixed an intermittent terrain rendering bug.<br>- [XB1, XB1S] Fixed an issue where textures would intermittently display black lines when rendering terrain.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Sub Quest "Obtain Freyna's Research Materials 1" would complete after clearing "Rockfall: Vulgus Strategic Outpost" even if the "Amorphous Material Pattern: Freyna" was not obtained.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Sub Quest "Prepare to Obtain Additional Materials for Freyna Research" could not be completed with Ultimate Bunny.<br>- Fixed an issue where the camera would intermittently freeze when removing parts during Intercept Battles.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Elite Vulgus Special Effect "Chasing Orb" would not deal damage.</p><p># Director's Additional Comment<br>Greetings, this is The First Descendant Director Minseok Joo. Today, I'm going to outline the Dev Team's plans for issues that are discussed frequently by the community.</p><p>The team is currently working on Season 1 and Season 2 updates, while also responding to improvement issues discovered during the live service. Today, I'm going to talk more about how we plan to improve the current state of The First Descendant rather than about the Season 1 and 2 updates.</p><p>Drop Rate Improvement Plans<br>While all of our drop rate systems are operating fairly in The First Descendant, we do understand that some players are struggling with the vagaries of drop rate. To address this, we're planning to introduce a "guaranteed drop" system where you're guaranteed to get the item you want after repeating the activity a certain number of times.</p><p>The First Descendant has various missions and Amorphous Materials with chance-dependent rewards. We're considering how we can effectively implement the "guaranteed drop" in such diverse reward systems, and we're working to create a farming structure that players will be happy with. We hope to make improvements before long to provide a more rational and satisfying farming experience.</p><p>Disposing of Leftover Items<br>Next is an update on items that are piling up in your Consumables. There is currently no way to dispose blueprints for Descendants and weapons that you've already completed, so there are cases where players are getting multiple copies of blueprints they already own during the farming process.</p><p>We've been listening to the community, who have told us that there needs to be a way to dispose of these unwanted items. While we could consider simply converting them into some Gold or Kuiper, we want to reward you with more value for the time you have put into the game.</p><p>To resolve this, the Dev Team is planning a system to dismantle leftover items to get byproducts, and a rotating shop system where you can exchange the byproducts for something of value. This will allow the items you obtained to have a greater value in the game.</p><p>Supporting Build Diversity<br>It's a lot of fun for us to see the variety of builds being posted in the community lately. We love seeing you try so many different builds and are amazed by the unexpected ways you've evolved them.</p><p>We hope for more builds to exist in The First Descendant, and we want an environment where players are free to experiment with different builds. However, we've found that it is difficult to take advantage of loadouts after assigning socket types, which goes against our goal of experimenting with different builds freely.</p><p>As a result, the Dev Team is planning to provide an environment where completely different builds can be created by assigning each loadout with different socket types. We hope this will help you experiment with different builds without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>Balancing<br>Finally, some news about balancing. We are seeing a dominance of the skill damage-focused builds of some Descendants. Descendants and weapons that are well-suited for these builds are quite popular now.</p><p>We want the meta builds to change from season to season. We want the Descendants and weapons that are effective in new content to be different from those in previous seasons. Also, we're looking to increase the proportion of firearm-based combat in the endgame.</p><p>We can't promise that all Descendants and weapons will be equally balanced at all times, but our goal is to keep changing the effective builds. To that end, we promise to make constant adjustments and offer different ways to play with new content.</p><p>We aim to implement the improvements I talked about today during Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>Your feedback means a lot to the Dev Team. We'll do our best to provide a better experience as we build the game together, and we'll continue to listen to you as we strive to make The First Descendant even better.</p></div><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson has discussed the impact of the SAG-AFTRA actors strike, stating the company doesn't anticipate "any significant short-term impact".
</p>
<p>
Wilson's comments were during a Q&amp;A after its latest earnings call, where an investor questioned the impact of the strike.
</p>
<p>
The CEO replied the company is "working diligently to negotiate at the table" but doesn't expect "near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development" or current live-service games.

<p>
His full quote is as follows (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company">IGN</a>):
</p>
<p>
"We deeply value our talented actors who are an important part of the work we do to deliver the incredible entertainment experiences that our players enjoy around the world. We're working very closely; this is not an EA-specific situation, this is an industry-specific situation, and we're working diligently to negotiate at the table. The way it works now in terms of our product specifically is that the strike is limited to games commencing production after September 2023, including live service games. So we don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running. That being said, we're committed to continuing to bargain in good faith and are hopeful that the parties can expediently resolve our issues at the bargaining table. But we're not anticipating any significant short-term impact at EA."
</p>
<p>
Members of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted last week to go on strike</a> due to concerns over the use of AI in video games as part of the Interactive Media Agreement.

</p>
<p>
The union has been in negotiations for over a year and a half with a number of major game companies, including EA, but has so far failed to reach a deal.
</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
A collective statement from video game producers responded: "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-suggests-gta-6-and-other-games-not-technically-hit-by-strike-could-still-be-impacted">terms of the strike from SAG-AFTRA states</a> all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work". As such, "while [non-struck games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union," said SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez.

</p>
<p>
However, it seems Wilson is confident EA's games won't be disrupted in this way.
</p>
<p>
The UK equivalent to SAG-AFTRA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity, has stated it stands "in solidarity" with the US union</a>, but won't authorise its own strike.

            <p>In case you skipped the headline, I’ll repeat myself. Among the wonderful sights contained in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>-poking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-great-fluctus">The Great Fluctus</a> are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.</p>

<p>“A very relaxing game to zone out for an hour, all while exploring cozy alien worlds, trading with mutants, rebuilding society and saving the world,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085280/The_Great_Fluctus/">Steam page</a>. “You're on a mission to explore strange new worlds, trade with quirky mutants, and rebuild society.” Said society has fallen to the evils of too much phone, apparently, which I’d say was a bit trite and unimaginative if the trailer hadn’t already convinced me that imagination was in no short supply here.</p>
<p>As you explore, you’ll “form bonds with quirky characters and guide entire civilizations, influencing their future through your choices and quests.” There’s a part in the trailer where you lead a small band of gribblies towards what is maybe a battle? Less interesting to me is the entire story laid out on Steam, which is decidedly a case of “please, say less," but your mileage may vary. Still, I’m a very large sucker for very large frogs, so this one’s a wishlist for me. No release date as of yet, but it looks as if The Great Fluctus is the work of just one developer. Let them cook their space beans, say I.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Once upon a time, my favourite place to write was on trains. Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video game in question is On Track (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836290/On_Track/">Steam link</a>), which isn't a game at all but a productivity booster that consists of a blissful carriage view of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/proteus">Proteus</a>-esque hillsides, lakes and forests. I'm not convinced by "productivity-boosting software" - I think the whole thing is a massive con, frankly. But I'll happily choo choo choose this one.</p>
<p>The productivity element of On Track consists of a to-do list, perched below the window, and a timer. There's optional lo-fi music (no thanks) and Sir Or Madam's Choice of ambient audio - you can make the train louder and even turn up the hubbub from other, unseen passengers. The geography evolves a little as you complete tasks. Expect "surprises", though probably nothing that'll jolt you out of your seat, such as a nudist in a passing locomotive, or finding yourself unexpectedly in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>.</p>
<p>You can slow down or stop the train at any time to investigate these surprises - ideal for simulating the classic LNER experience of having your journey delayed by 45 minutes, because a solitary potato crisp fell out the rear window of the next train along. Many great novels have been written during such lulls, though so far not by me.</p>
<p>On Track launches today, and will be free to play. Phoenix, Arizona-based developers GigaTank3000 are also the creators of the relatively unchill <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1975380/Kaiju_Catastrophe/">Kaiju Catastrophe</a>, in which you run around procedurally generated SimCities as Godzilla. There's a demo for that - perhaps it'll help you reach inbox zero, if you take Godzilla for a rampage in carefully controlled, endorphin-boosting five minute bursts?

		<p>Grinding Gear Games has posted a small update about the Path of Exile PS5 native client, that the studio confirmed it was developing a few weeks ago. The short version is that the native client is being treated as a new title by Sony, so it has to go through the certification process once again before being approved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile: Settlers of Kalguur Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOX7KZng_OI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, Grinding Gear Games said,<em> “During our GGG Live broadcast a couple of weeks ago, we mentioned working on a native Path of Exile client for PlayStation 5. In this news post we’d like to give you a small update regarding this and when to expect the client to go live. The PlayStation 5 native client is treated as a new title submission on PlayStation 5. It gets all new PlayStation 5 services integrations like party and trophies. This means that we needed to rework some of those systems compared to the PlayStation 4 client and certify them.</em></p>
<p><em>At this moment, the game client itself is finished, but we still need to make some adjustments to satisfy the certification requirements. However, these are minor and should not take long.This also means that the PlayStation 5 client gets a new set of trophies (which are identical to PlayStation 4 trophies) and those will be unlocked automatically when you login to the game.We expect to finish certification within the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience!”</em></p>

            <p>Few acts in games feel quite as gleefully gratifying as removing a knight’s shiny dome with a halberd swing in medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> melee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a>. In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-room-in-hell-2">No More Room In Hell 2</a> well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”</p>

<p>A live service game gracefully bowing out, in this economy? My liege! “With Chivalry 2, we set out to make the ultimate medieval battlefield game: an unparalleled multiplayer experience that realized our dream of being a warrior on the fields of battle, inspired by classic medieval movie scenes and old tales of glory from history,” wrote Torn Banner in a <a href="https://chivalry2.com/2024/07/30/chivalry-2-the-path-ahead-for-chivalry/">blog post</a> yesterday. “With this final content update delivered to players, we’re excited to focus our efforts and resources on compelling new multiplayer projects, both in the Chivalry universe as well as within terrifying new co-op territory.”</p>
<p>That terrifying new co-op territory is No More Room In Hell 2, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/8-player-co-op-zombie-smasher-no-more-room-in-hell-2-releases-in-early-access-this-october">we last saw</a> at SGF earlier this year. It’s currently slated for release this October, but this won’t mean the end for Chivalry. “We’ve been building our team in number and skillset to take on these following challenges, with a focused effort to ensure that when the next Chivalry title is released, it will utterly blow players away.” Neither has support for Chivalry 2 completely ended, as there'll still be hotfixes and the like.</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a busy few years for Chivalry 2. There’s a <a href="https://trello.com/b/7HnXYjSb/chivalry-2-roadmap-preview">Trello board</a> where you can view the entire history of the game’s roadmap, which totals 11 major content drops, ending with the story conclusion of the Regicide update. Rick Lane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-peasants-to-kings-the-making-of-chivalry-2">had a chat</a> with Torn Banner around the time of the game’s release, and it seems like the team have basically checked off every wishlist item they had for Chivalry’s 2’s future. Whether they did indeed succeed in making the “best horses ever,” though, I’ll let you decide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to chief development officer Veronique Lallier, the answer is rooted in the company's decision to ditch shareholders and go independent back in 2017.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer earlier this month, Lallier said it was "heartbreaking" to see how many studios and developers have been impacted by closures and layoffs, and explained IOI has "aways been very conscious and very careful" about how it grows to avoid similar situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Lallier, expanding requires finding the right talent for the right projects, ensuring you can unleash the passion of your employees so they can fulfill their potential. "You need to focus on the game, and the type of game you're making—while making sure you aren't spreading yourself across too many project," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After working hard to improve and develop Hitman as a franchise, for instance, it made sense for IOI to expand with Project 007. Securing the rights to develop a James Bond title might seem like a no-brainer, but Lallier explains those big decisions have to make sense. She says leaping from Hitman to Project 007 felt natural because they're both essentially "secret agent" titles—which is a genre baked into the DNA of the studio.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise">Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multi-project studios like IOI require a lot of talent, and Lallier says that once you've welcomed people into the fold, it's vital you leverage them in the right way. "Making games is very hard. I'm not going to lie. So, I think the recipe of success is to be focused on your passion," she explains. On a practical level, that means allowing the teams within IOI to iterate rapidly and without fear. Playing every day. Testing every day. Sharing ideas with colleagues across disciplines and locations. Challenging each other to "find the fun." It's a highly collaborative approach that works because IOI put the foundations in place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, although IOI has studios in multiple locations, Lallier says they're all in timezones that overlap. "You can based in Copenhagen, Malmo, Barcelona, Brighton, or Istanbul and working across the same project," she says. "That's how we are divided, but if you look at the geography, we make sure we're all in the same ballpark of timezones. So we don't have people on the West Coast of America and we don't have people in Japan."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She adds that managing your finances as an independent studio is also "critical," and says "lean" spending during the earliest phases of development can help provide a runway for success. Lallier feels those decisions, which might sound mundane on paper, have ultimately given IOI the edge. Notably, she suggests the company was only able to put that plan in place because it's not beholden to the whims of shareholders or a parent company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think studios can suffer when they're on the stock market and so on—when there are big changes happening. All of a sudden you can lose millions and billions, but we don't have this problem," she says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have different challenges as an independent studio, because you might not have the power of a big publisher, but I think the advantage is that the constraints we have are the constraints we can control to some extent. Then we can forecast—we can see how much money we have. How much time we have based on that burn rate. Then we can find ways to still create the thing that makes sense without compromising so much because you have less external influences that you need to handle."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-pass-august-2024-lineup-just-got-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following earlier rumors, leaker extas1s has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCN_it98zkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a partial Game Pass lineup for the month of August. Most of the games were previously leaked, but now we have dates. Deck13's Action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-reportedly-coming-to-game-pass-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas Fallen</a>, for instance, will land on Microsoft's subscription service on August 13, exactly one week after the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reign of Sand update</a>, which is aiming to vastly improve the game in various areas thanks to brand new voice acting, new areas, new enemies, new Essence Stones, a New Game Plus mode, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard's Crash N.Sane Trilogy was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to join Game Pass. According to extas1s, the remastered collection of the beloved platform franchise will be released on the subscription service on Thursday, August 8.</p>
<p>Just five days later, Game Pass subscribers will get Mafia Definitive Edition, the remake of the classic open world game that marked the beginning of the franchise. 2K has since <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1818376797773500774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-definitive-edition-rumored-to-be-headed-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, so this addition is actually official now.</p>
<p>These are the biggest new games coming in the month of the August, but there's more on the way. The wave begins on August 6 with SOPA - Tale of the Stolen Potato, an indie adventure game set in South America. The following day, Game Pass users will get to play Creatures of Ava, a so-called creature saver game where players traverse an alien planet, solving environmental challenges and rescuing the native creatures from an infection called 'withering'.</p>
<p>On August 15, the leaked schedule says the subscription service will be updated with Wargroove 2, Chucklefish's acclaimed turn-based tactics sequel released in October 2023. Last but not least, Pugstorm's Core Keeper will be added on Tuesday, August 27. Core Keeper is a 'mining sandbox adventure' game released in March 2022 via early access. It is set in a procedurally generated underground world, borrowing mechanics from the likes of Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Minecraft.</p>
<p>This appears to be the full August Game Pass slate, although extas1s previously said Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 are also coming soon to the subscription service. Moreover, Grand Theft Auto V might <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-coming-soon-to-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join</a> PC Game Pass in the near future. Of course, the biggest recent addition was the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p>
<p>Does this lineup convince you to subscribe, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent price increase</a>?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-gaming-ecosystem-has-500-million-monthly-active-users.940956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent financial update, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, went on file explaining that the company’s gaming arm has ‘over 500 million monthly active users’ (MAU) across all platforms and devices under that umbrella. He also mentioned that the gaming ‘content pipeline’ has “never been stronger”.</p>



<p>This news comes as Microsoft revealed a decline year-on-year of more than 40% in hardware sales, but an uptick in software sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-staggering-numbers">Staggering Numbers</h2>



<p>In the financial update <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Microsoft</a>, it was detailed that the firm had seen a growth in revenue in Q4 FY24, and that ‘Xbox Content and Services’ revenue was a huge driver for this, with the sector increasing a whopping 61%.</p>



<p>While speaking about the update, Satya Nadella pointed out that Fallout was the second most-watched series on Amazon Prime <strong>ever</strong>, and that the success of the television series increased “hours played on Game Pass” for the franchise fivefold quarter-over-quarter.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s CFO, Amy Hood, explained that hardware revenue ‘will decline again’, but that loss is being offset by positive results pulled in by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which continues to pay off for Microsoft. </p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A section of the financial call, only one query was aimed at gaming, which Nadella fielded, making key comments about the diversification of Microsoft’s portfolio:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console, and then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. We feel that now, we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we’re also excited about the new sockets. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are strong expectations for Microsoft’s performance in the coming months.</p>

<p>In the latest wave of claims to hit the content creator space, it was alleged that Kai Cenat’s ‘cameraman’ known as ChrisV had been knowingly messaging a minor in 2021. Per the claims, Chris was inappropriately messaging this individual despite having been told she was only 17 years old.</p>



<p>In an emotional stream segment, Kai recently confirmed that the claims are true to the best of his knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, we’ve seen Dr Disrespect taken down by similar allegations, and MrBeast’s Ava Kris Tyson was cut from his company after several claims surfaced of nefarious acts and behaviour occurring over several years. </p>



<p>Now, Kai Cenat’s team has been hit, with the prolific streamer’s cameraman being targeted by allegations that the creator has confirmed are true. It was reported that ChrisV has been working with Kai Cenat for several years. During a recent stream, Kai Cenat said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This s*** is so f***ing dumb. My cameraman, Chris… In 2021, he got caught talking to a minor who was 17 years old. She lied about her age. She said she was 19, she ended up saying her age, said she was 17. Right at that moment, you’re supposed to stop texting. You can’t have an excuse for this.</p>



<p>I reached out to the person. She showed me every single thing. It’s confirmed. I’m sick and tired of having to do s*** like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While confirming the revelation, Kai Cenat became noticeably emotional and frustrated, slamming his desk and becoming visibly distressed. He questioned why these topics are popping up every few days and announced his complete split from ChrisV, cutting all ties and pushing him as far away as possible. </p>

<p>Twitch is arguably the number-one streaming platform in the world, boasting millions of users and a reported annual revenue of $2 billion – but it’s <strong>still not profitable </strong>for Amazon. In 2014, Amazon acquired the streaming platform for around $1 billion, but more than ten years after that sweeping purchase, it has been revealed that the tech titan <strong>still </strong>isn’t making money from the streaming site.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always-losing">Always Losing</h2>



<p>This news came from a WSJ report that discussed Amazon’s failure to make money through Twitch after more than ten years of owning and supporting the platform. The cost of running the site through Amazon’s infrastructure means that the firm has failed to ever profit from the streaming platform, despite it pulling in a reported $2 billion a year.</p>



<p>In the report <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published in WSJ</a>, it was claimed that fewer users are signing up to Twitch and the ‘biggest spenders’ are neglecting to pump the site with money. In recent months, Twitch has suffered from widespread layoffs as Amazon has attempted to pivot to adjust to new financial woes that have struck much of the wider industry, and per <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-insiders-fear-mass-layoffs-as-amazon-loses-billions-on-zombie-brand-2844252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, insiders are concerned that another wave is on the horizon.</p>



<p>It was also claimed by those close to Twitch that several projects have been cancelled or postponed internally because there isn’t any hunger or <strong>budget </strong>to float them. </p>



<p>With rising competition in the form of YouTube and Kick and constant complaints from the community about changes to Twitch, the top-tier streaming site could be about to pass a point of no return.</p>
