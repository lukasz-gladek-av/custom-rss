            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that yet another studio is joining the long-awaited (and apparently rather troubled)&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>This time around (no pun intended), it's <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the turn of Ubisoft Toronto</a>, the studio responsible for making 2020's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/watch-dogs-legion-review">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Toronto says it's "excited to rewind time" and bring its "creativity, expertise and updated tech" to the project, which is already being worked on by former&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=1NuMTd41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=nSkrPu8i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>just got itself a new developer.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-arriving-in-january">all the way back in September 2020</a>&nbsp;and was given a January 2021 release date, which seems almost hilariously quaint in hindsight.</p>

<p>Obviously, that date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-until-march">subsequently delayed</a>&nbsp;in late 2020, with Ubisoft claiming at that point that the game would launch in March 2021. Again, we can look back on that date and laugh.</p>

<p>In February 2021,&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-delayed">was again delayed</a>, although this time it wasn't given a new release date, with Ubisoft instead saying that the game would launch on "a later date" so as to ensure that the remake would be "the best game possible".</p>

<p>Since then, we haven't heard much from the project, although it has been delayed numerous times in the interim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=lWdsCqn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=p31eEV1D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two other major&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>projects have been released since the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally, the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was being led by the India-based studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1521519964074749954" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that development had shifted to&nbsp;original&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022.</p>

<p>Now, it looks like Toronto has been brought on to help. Will these two Ubisoft studios be the final custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>If you're hankering for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>fix, though, two other rather good franchise projects have been released in the intervening years: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space">Metroidvania</a> <i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest">roguelite platformer</a>&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>. They're both well worth checking out.</p>

He assured fans that <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse </em>will not use any generative AI. He also had some major criticisms about the use of the technology.</p><p>“There is no generative AI in <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em> and there never will be,” Miller wrote. “One of the main goals of the films is to create new visual styles that have never been seen in a studio CG film, not steal the generic plagiarized average of other artists’ work.”</p><p>While hearing Miller advocate for the human touch in these films is heartening, any talk of the means by which <em>Spider-Verse </em>movies are made requires mentioning reports of overwork and unsustainable production processes during the development of <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em>. For more on that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out <em>Vulture</em>’s story</a></span>. The solution to these problems isn’t to replace human workers with AI, it’s to create better pipelines for a humane work environment. Much of the response to Miller’s statement has acknowledged they appreciate his stance, while rightfully calling out the alleged working conditions on the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films.</p><p><em>Beyond the Spider-Verse </em>was originally meant to premiere in March of 2024, though that obviously didn’t come to pass.

<p>In a recent interview with the LA Times, Neil Druckmann spoke at length about The Last of Us and the future of Naughty Dog, the studio that he has led (or co-led) for several years. He mentioned that the studio won’t <strong>always </strong>be focused on The Last of Us and that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several single-player projects</a> in the works at the firm, but while doing so, he dropped a juicy tidbit about the origin story of the legendary post-apocalyptic game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-other-mediums">Other Mediums</h2>



<p>In the opening section of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview with the LA Times</a>, it was explained that Druckmann’s idea for The Last of Us’ base story was destined to become a graphic novel. It was a concept he’d been nurturing since college – the emotional, intense story of a man and a young girl traversing a harrowing, apocalyptic landscape in search of greener pastures.</p>



<p>Druckmann wanted to put pen to paper and turn this gritty story into a graphic novel long before he had the idea of turning it into a video game. In the report, it was said that even when Druckmann was working in that environment, he wasn’t inclined to even <strong>pitch </strong>the idea of The Last of Us – until he did.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Immediately the light bulb went off.</p>
<cite>Neil Druckmann on realising he was ready to raise The Last of Us</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 2013, Naughty Dog released The Last of Us to the world, and gaming history was forever changed. This legendary game would go on to spawn a follow-up title seven years later, and eventually, an award-winning television series. From the seed of an idea to one of the most highly awarded franchises in gaming, The Last of Us – which should have started life as a graphic novel – became a super-selling series recognised worldwide for its storytelling and intensely realistic setting.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Ubisoft Toronto confirmed that it is joining the development on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.</p>



<p>The team says that they will bring the studio’s “creativity, expertise, and updated tech” as they join the Ubisoft Montreal devs. </p>



<p>This marks a major step forward for development on the game. Ubisoft confirmed the game years ago, and development appeared to face a series of setbacks. In 2022, it was announced the game would move from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Montreal.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time!</p><p>We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftMTL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UbisoftMTL</a>. <a href="https://t.co/kksyihIjKG">pic.twitter.com/kksyihIjKG</a></p></div>— Ubisoft Toronto (@UbisoftToronto) <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Last April, Insider Gaming reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive details</a> about the anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. That includes footage sent to Insider Gaming, which suggests that the release is likely far off. </p>



<p>However, now that Ubisoft Toronto is joining development, it’s unclear if the added support could hasten the potential release window.</p>



<p>Fans are also concerned about Ubisoft Toronto appearing to shift away from a Splinter Cell remake. However, the team recently seemed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepared to share news</a> about Splinter Cell.</p>



<p>Combined with Ubisoft Toronto’s decision to move towards Prince of Persia, this may further imply that a major Splinter Cell remake could be coming soon. However, Ubisoft Toronto has not officially confirmed any details about the Splinter Cell remake just yet.</p>



<p>Most recently, Prince of Persia fans were able to try out the Early Access version of The Rogue Prince of Persia when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-launches-into-early-access-on-may-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on May 27</a>. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run.888213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-is-dead-preview-just-one-more-run<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I beat Dragon is Dead’s first boss at 5 AM. I died about 3 seconds later. I thought I was in a cutscene, watching him die, and I was - for about three seconds. Then the cutscene ended, and one of his little skeleton minions whacked me in the face, and I was back to the start. But I knew I had a build that worked. I felt lucky. Twenty minutes later, he went down again, and I kept going. When I finally bought it and respawned at the Fountain of Life, I was happy to drag myself to bed… but I was also already planning the next run.</p><p>What I’m saying, then, is that Dragon is Dead is a game for sickos (complimentary), and I’m sickos. Developed by Team Suneat, who you may know as the team behind Blade Assault, Dragon is Dead is part Castlevania, part Diablo, part roguelite, all pixel art hack-n-slash glory. Throw in some unique RPG and progression elements, and Team Suneat’s latest dish is shaping up to be finger-licking good.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Is Dead - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s get it out of the way: whether you’re traipsing around the corrupted, skeleton-infested remnants of a once-sacred forest or just walking through a camp of tired, worn-down, hopeless soldiers, Dragon is Dead features absolutely stunning pixel art. You can practically hear these brittle tree branches swaying in the wind and smell the desperation of the small groups of soldiers working to keep the monsters at bay. Combine that with some excellent and atmospheric music, and Dragon is Dead is selling an aesthetic - and a mood - from the word go.</p><p>But mood, tone, and aesthetics are only part of the package. Dragon is Dead plays well, too. It’s a side-scrolling hack-n-slash with an obvious reverence for Castlevania - the Spellblade’s dodge animation is a very clear callback to Alucard’s dodge animation in Symphony of the Night - but it marries that with a Diablo-esque UI and loot system that allows you to re-roll individual stats on weapons and armor. The leveling system resembles Diablo IV’s - spells and abilities are segmented into tiers like “Basic Skills” and “Core Skills” with several options and upgrades, and spending enough skill points unlocks the next tier and its corresponding abilities. It opens up some neat build opportunities that encourage you to specialize in abilities that complement each other and build your gear around those skills.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There were two classes in the build I played: the aforementioned Spellblade, who specializes in elemental magic attacks, and the Berserker, who builds Madness by using his Basic Skills and then cashes out for big damage with his Core Skills. They play very differently: the Berserker is slower, tankier, and hits harder, but the Spellblade is faster, has a more generous dodge, and can build combos by stacking skills that use the same kind of magic. Both, however, feel fantastic, and it’s fun to build a cool combination of abilities and spells to cut through the demons infesting Dragon is Dead’s world.</p><p>But what I like most so far is the way Dragon is Dead handles death and progression. This is a roguelite. That means that when you die, everything about your character resets: your level, items, power-ups like Artifacts and Soul Gems, everything that makes your build your build, with only two exceptions: your gear, and Magic Stones, a special currency that you can use to buy gear and reroll your stats. After a few runs, you’ll have a good feel for the abilities you like and the stats you’ll want on your gear to support them. Building up your gear after a run matters, but like the best roguelites, what happens during the run is what separates a close victory from a brutal defeat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>During your run, you’ll come across Magic Stones and keys that will allow you to open special chests, which are always useful, and gold you can spend at stores for temporary power-ups or new abilities; Artifacts, which will let you carry more than one potion, upgrade your health and resource pools, boost your damage,  or give you special perks like making enemies more likely to drop potions or dropping more Artifacts once you open a certain number of chests; and Soul Gems, which offer flat upgrades to your core stats. </p><p>Clearing areas gives you your choice of a pair of chests that contains one of these things, but you’ll also be able to buy them in stores and find them in certain areas. There are also special chests scattered throughout the environment that you can open with unique keys you can find or buy in the store. Artifacts also have synergy, which means that finding two or more of the same type will add bonuses so you can really dish out the hurt if you’re smart about how you build during a run. If you’re looking for depth, Dragon is Dead seems like it’ll have it, but you will have to get a little lucky, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That means that you’ll probably have to alter your build on the fly if, say, you’re a Spellblade playing with a lighting build and you get an Artifact that boosts fire damage. Luckily, it’s easy to do… provided you have the coin. Naturally, environments also change each time you go through them, so no two runs are alike, which is good, because you’re probably going to die. A lot. At least initially.</p><p>At the start of each run, you can only carry one potion, and whether or not you’ll find another one or the ability to carry more than one at a time is largely luck. Sometimes, a run just isn’t going to work out in your favor, and you’re going to die. Because your gear - and your ability to buy more gear, reroll a stat on any piece of gear you have, and the keys to those special chests - carries over between runs, you’re always progressing, even if it may not feel that way. But once you come back to the opening town after a particularly close run and replace your Magic items with Rares, and see how fast stuff dies as a result? You really feel it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re always progressing, even if it may not feel that way.</p></div><p>And once you get into the groove of Dragon is Dead’s combat, it feels incredible. Like any roguelite, a lot of learning to deal with any given enemy is just practice. At first, you might not know what an enemy does or how to deal with them. The first time I fought Longmore, a three-headed tree that serves as the game’s first boss and the guy that kept me up until 5 in the morning, I had no idea how to deal with the insane number of flaming, demonic skulls he was sending at me, and when I got to him, I barely had any health left to learn. Needless to say, I died real fast. </p><p>The last time? I was cutting down the enemies standing between me and him like they were barely there, and when I made it to the fight, the skulls barely hit me. I was wearing items with more dodge, so I was avoiding some of them automatically, but I was also better at dodging them manually. I barely got hit. In my time with it, Dragon is Dead’s progression rewarded me for creating a build over time and being smart with my gear, but it also rewarded me for getting better as a player. It’s a hard line to walk, but Dragon is Dead seems like it’s on the right path.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With Dragon is Dead, I had to stop because I needed to sleep.</p></div><p>I do have a couple of minor concerns. First, while Dragon is Dead’s lore is cool, its writing is a little flat. Characters announce who they are, what they do, how they feel, and then dispense lore without much flavor or personality. It’s a small qualm, but when everything else looks and feels so good, it does stand out. The other is that the UI, especially in shops, doesn’t always give you a good idea of how many resources of each type you have. But it’s early days, and Team Suneat has plenty of time to iron this stuff out.</p><p>Usually, when I finish previewing a game, it’s because I’ve done everything I want to do. With Dragon is Dead, I had to stop because I needed to sleep. In a world where I didn’t have to type this up, dear reader, I’m still playing Dragon is Dead. So far, it’s beautiful, feels wonderful to play, has interesting and unique progression systems that reward long-term planning and player skill, and every run feels unique. If Team Suneat can keep this up, well… the sky’s the limit. For now, I’m left thinking of the next run. In another world, I’m past Longmore, past that cave, cutting down demons and slinging spells like the daylight is never coming. Unfortunately, previews don’t write themselves. But tonight? I’m diving right back in. I have a dragon to kill.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Project Zomboid </em>developer The Indie Stone has been hard at work on the game’s next major update, Build 42, for years, and it’s finally due to release <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboids-hotly-anticipated-build-42-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in 2024</a>. According to the latest development blog post, in fact, it may be coming soon, and it’s loaded with graphical improvements.</p> <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">Notably, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108600/view/4164219969939382164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Indie Stone has explained</a> that <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s hugely improved crafting system is the last major blocker for Build 42’s unstable candidate release, and that the team has decided to separate the feature into two stages to ensure a timely launch window. “As such we’ve decided it would be a better approach to polish up what we have, and continue the process of bug fixing and polishing the build to the point it would be able to go into the Unstable branch,” says the blog post.</p>
 <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">What this means, in effect, is that a portion of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s new crafting system won’t be out until Build 43. On the flip side, this will also mean that there shouldn’t be any undue pushbacks for Build 42, which is good news indeed. This shouldn’t be a huge concern, granted, as a massive chunk of the new crafting system will still make it into Build 42, and to spice things up further, we now have an even better taste of some of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s upcoming visual glow-up.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Indie Stone</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-project-zomboid-build-42-s-visual-improvements-are-a-delight" data-injectable="false">Project Zomboid Build 42’s visual improvements are a delight</h2> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Certainly, the fact that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboid-explains-build-42s-massive-performance-and-lighting-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 will both look <em>and</em> run much better</a> is a known quantity. The bit we didn’t know, though, is that The Indie Stone is also working on a comprehensive visual tune-up of the game’s existing locations: “With all the improvement, and the new tiles going toward this improvement, then our existing towns were starting to look a little threadbare. Until now, of course,” says the blog.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">To get a sense of just how transformative the upgrade is, check out the old version of <em>Zomboid</em>‘s Muldraugh police station above, and then compare it to the Build 42 version of the same building, featured below: </p> <figure data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Indie Stone</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">The lighting and rendering improvements The Indie Stone has promised for Build 42 were plenty exciting on their own, but to see old locations brought back up-to-spec to such an extent is something else entirely. If there was any doubt that <em>Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 would be a must-play for fans of the game, the featured comparison ought to dispel it.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">For more comparisons of the current Build 41 and the upcoming Build 42’s overworld map, be sure to check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/108600/view/4164219969939382164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Thursdoid blog from The Indie Stone over on Steam</a>. Also featured are some lighting demos, new baggies and boxes, and novelty keychains – because why not?</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Now that the inevitable scope creep of <em>Project Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 has been reeled in, and The Indie Stone has outright mentioned an unstable playable build of the game, it’s obvious that we’re closing in on the update’s release. Any month now…</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Have you been playing <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and spotted the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement message, you may wonder what it actually means. Well, that’s where I come in, as I can tell you all about the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement system. </p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">One of the best things about <em>Call of Duty</em> over the years has been the in-game voice system. I still remember the days of <em>MW2</em> when everyone would get into lobbies and trash-talk each other. Now, we also have a chat system too where you can type out messages to both teammates and opponents. </p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">If you’ve been using these systems for mischief, or been incredibly toxic to people in your matches, there’s a good chance you’ll get reported. That’s where the Disruptive Behavior Enforcement message comes in. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Don’t be toxic to your teammates. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-is-disruptive-behavior-enforcement-in-mw3" data-injectable="false">What is Disruptive Behavior Enforcement in<em> MW3</em></h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true"><strong>Disruptive Behavior Enforcement in <em>MW3</em> means that you cannot use the in-game voice or text chats to talk to teammates or opponents. </strong>Your behavior has been punished and can last from a day to weeks depending on how serious your offense is, or how often you’ve been banned. </p>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">This comes as part of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s Code of Conduct which asks players to “treat everyone with respect,” which is fair enough when you think about it. If you’re caught bullying, harassing, or making derogatory comments based on things like race, gender, or sexual orientation, you will receive this punishment. </p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="false">According to Activision, voice and text logs are monitored by both humans and technology, so you’ll not automatically get away with it if nobody reports you. Just keep your trash talk civil, and you should be ok. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date-revealed-for-august.888180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PSVR2 PC adapter, which will allow you to use your PlayStation VR2 headset to play VR games on Steam, will launch later this summer.</p>

<p>We first learned that PSVR2 would get PC support <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-pc-support">back in February</a>, but now, thanks to a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, we know that the adapter will arrive on August 7th and will set you back $59.99 or your regional equivalent. Never knowingly underpriced, eh, Sony?</p>

<p>If you want to use the adapter, you'll also need a DisplayPort cable that meets the DisplayPort 1.4 standards, as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum hardware requirements for PSVR2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=TqV7LzIK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=Df8APyVY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to use your PSVR2 headset to play&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>? Soon, you'll be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the specs your PC will need to have if you want to avail yourself of the PSVR2 PC adapter.</p>

<ul><li>Windows 11 or Windows 10, 64-bit</li>
	<li>Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100 with Zen2 architecture or later</li>
	<li>8GB RAM</li>
	<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with Turing architecture or later, or AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later</li>
	<li>DisplayPort 1.4</li>
	<li>Direct USB connection</li>
	<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul><p>You'll also need to download the PlayStation VR2 app and the SteamVR app, but once you've done that (and assuming your PC meets the aforementioned requirements, of course), you just need to connect the adapter to your PSVR2 and your PC and you'll be ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=AdLQ0ycR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=1ORjClT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This could be you, but imagine that the PS5 is a PC and you've bought the PSVR2 PC adapter.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are some caveats to using PSVR2 on PC. Naturally, you won't be able to play any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-launch-window-lineup-detailed-13-new-games-announced">PS5 VR games</a> on Steam; this adapter is just so that you can play Steam-based VR games with your headset.</p>

<p>You also won't be able to take advantage of PSVR2 features like haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, HDR, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tobii-is-negotiation-with-sony-for-psvr2">eye tracking</a>. However, you'll still feel the rumble of the controllers, and features like the headset's 4K visuals and finger touch detection should still work.</p>

<p>The PSVR2 PC adapter launches on August 7th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

UK high street retailer GAME will shutter its long-running reward programme on 31st July 2024, the chain has announced. This applies to the standard GAME Reward scheme and also the Elite membership tier. 
</p>
<p>
No further reward points will be earned from purchases made in GAME stores or GAME's website from two weeks' earlier - on 15th July. 
</p>
<p>
As of 31st July, you will no longer be able to redeem reward points, either.

<p>
"We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME reward points prior to the closure date on purchases in game store or online to avoid disappointment," GAME wrote today. 
</p>
<p>
"After the closure date, GAME reward points will be reset to zero and the GAME reward account will be closed, you will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME reward points." 
</p>
<p>
Per GAME's terms and conditions, you can redeem 400 reward points for £1 off of a purchase. You will also need to redeem a minimum of 400 Points to use up any remaining balance.
</p>
<p>
The end of GAME Elite, meanwhile, will mean the end of its monthly offers, prize draws and other promotions. Any outstanding paid Elite membership months will be eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
An FAQ on the changes poses the question of what existing GAME reward card holders should do with their soon-to-be-worthless membership card. "They can be destroyed as they will no longer be in use," the FAQ states. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was told of the likely end to the GAME reward programme earlier this year, as part of the chain's ongoing changes which have seen it take up residence largely within Sports Direct and other Fraser Group outlets as concessions, rather than their own bespoke high street stores. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME reward schemes are part of further moves to standardise the business to operate within concession units, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">after the end of GAME's long-running trade-in scheme</a>. Going forward, GAME will be able to sell stock through Fraser Group till software, without the need for a bespoke GAME till with the chain's trade-in product database, or need to accomodate GAME reward points.

            <p>Following news earlier this year it was planning to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">roll out PS VR2 support on PC</a>, Sony has announced the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter.</p>
<p>With this adapter in play, users' VR headsets will become compatible with PCs, which in turn will allow them to expand their libraries with a large number of games on SteamVR. Yes, that includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx.</p>

<p>In addition to the adapter itself, players will also need to ensure they have a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4. A Steam account is also required, and you will need to ensure your PC is up to the task of supporting the hardware.</p>

<p>Sony notes there will be some differences using its PS VR2 set on PC compared to on consoles. For example, HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble) will not be available when playing on PC.</p>
<p>It will still support high-fidelity and sensory immersion features, however, with Sony highlighting its 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games. </p>
<p>"While the most immersive way to experience PS VR2 gaming remains on PS5, we hope players will enjoy the ability to play an expanded lineup of VR games on PC using the same headset," PlayStation closed.</p><p>

The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter is set to arrive on 7th  August, retailing at £49.99/ $59.99 / €59.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p>You can check out the full <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> mod FAQ page <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4179982568653520452">here</a>, and players interested in testing mod support during the closed beta in July will have the opportunity to sign up at a later date. As Larian has stated, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">it has no plans of creating DLC or a <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> sequel</a>, so offering official mod support is the studio’s way of letting the community take over the reins of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> development to ensure the game stays fresh for years to come. </p><p>Patch 7 isn’t just introducing mod support tools. It’ll also contain substantial content updates for the game, including improved evil endings, tons of small narrative additions (Wyll romancers, your time is coming), and bug fixes. Beyond Patch 7’s release in September, Larian also said it plans on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4172097464031362567">adding crossplay and photo mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megacopter-blades-of-the-goddess">Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess</a> is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.</p><!--more-->
<p>I'd do a plot summary for Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess, but it feels like this would be missing the point - like introducing a party clown to the kids by making them read his LinkedIn profile. So let's jump straight into the act of slithering through the skies of those gaudy comicbook maps, switching between air-to-air and air-to-ground cannons while avoiding a bevy of unguided or homing projectiles that are ineffectual enough individually, but murderous in dozens. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>There's a touch of latter-day open worlding in the form of radar stations you can hack with your cybernetic crane to clear away fog of war. There are explodables to detonate, often positioned so that you can spark off a line of blast clouds right through a base. And there are special moves bestowed by the aforesaid blood-drinking goddess, like briefly transforming your helicopter into a sizzling green shuriken.</p>
<p>It's a great on-the-go game, based on 30 minutes with the demo over the weekend. The colour palette scrubs up a treat on a Steam Deck, and your carnivorous chopper has a nice sense of inertia when dancing through that ever-thickening canopy of bullets. I was frustrated, then engrossed by how Megacopter handles switching between shooting at aerial targets and those on the ground: this forces your brain to reckon with the fact that the distinction doesn't "really" exist because the world isn't "true" polygonal 3D, a quirk of many 90s isometric games I sort of miss.</p>
<p>Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is out 21st June - you can find it and the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/">Steam</a>. Developers Pizza Bear Games consist of Gabe Miller and Nicholas Hunter, with Robin Ogden of OGRE Sound supplying some rad period music. If you like this kind of thing, you might also get a kick out of the antique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-renegade-ops">Renegade Ops</a> or the much more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/go-mecha-ball-out-today-on-steam-and-game-pass-is-a-swish-blend-of-twin-stick-shooting-and-pinball-physics">Go Mecha Ball</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168972/haikyu-coach-ukai-best-anime-crushes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oGPVgQ">One of the best parts of the human experience, if I do say so myself, is having a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes">big ol’ crush</a> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affection, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” After all, brief yet intense infatuations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade">don’t necessarily have to be on real people</a> (or even on people!), nor do they have to be romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</p>

<p id="gFkzSW">Watching <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review"><em>Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle</em></a> reminded me what a hottie the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team’s coach is. There are a lot of good boys (and a couple of girls!) in the sports anime and manga, which follows an underdog volleyball team on their quest to greatness. But watching the movie affirmed to me that my biggest crush in the series is the man who was initially reluctant to mentor the team, coach Keishin Ukai.</p>
<p id="CLzDRa">Ukai is a bit prickly, but he has a big heart. He only agreed to serve as the team’s coach for a practice match between the their historic rival Nekoma (incidentally, the team featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em>). But eventually, he agrees to stay on, reminded of his love of the sport. (And his desire to finally beat Nekoma in a game!) We love a good character development! Once a member of the Karasuno High School volleyball team, Ukai was initially hesitant to go back because he didn’t want to cloud his own nostalgia for his high school days. That’s a nice little touch of backstory that immediately lets me imagine how his high school days went, and concoct elaborate stories for what his life has been like in the intervening years. </p>
<p id="rfY62K">His gruff personality balances out faculty advisor Ittetsu Takeda, who is polite, plucky about everything, and a bit clueless about volleyball. I just think they have a great vibe as co-workers and eventual friends! </p>

<p id="g8WTrf">On the most superficial level, Ukai is blond — or rather, anime blond, in that he has yellow hair. I have a weakness for blond fictional men — one of these days I’ll try to pinpoint the origin of that response, but for now, I’m simply letting it dictate where my heart lies. And Ukai is hot in that <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-sexy-dirtbag-cook">“sexually competent dirtbag line cook”</a> way, in that he’s a bit surly but definitely not unkind, maintains a certain edgy appearance, and also drinks and smokes, but in a sexy way that shows he knows how to have fun. To me, this is only attractive when the guy isn’t real — but boy, does it hit!</p>
<p id="cSNwFY">In one episode of the show, a few of the players who are struggling with their schoolwork come to Ukai for advice. He lights a cigarette and glares at them with a cocky grin, saying “Does it <em>look</em> like I was good at school?” That’s when I fell for him.  </p>
<p id="AfUHDm">Coach Ukai isn’t heavily featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em> — or heck, even in the TV show. But seeing him in the background of the movie still reignited my crush. Sometimes less is more when it comes to latching onto a fictional character. </p>
<p id="ONSB4o">Or maybe not! Maybe your crush of the week is the main character of your latest TV obsession, or the featured protagonist in your favorite video game. Or maybe, like me, you’ve decided to be really into a gruff guy with a secret soft side, even though he mostly stays in the background. Let me know who you’re crushing on this week! </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-codename-spiral-may-be-splatoon-4-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.888159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-codename-spiral-may-be-splatoon-4-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797415318631104801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X from reliable leaker @MbKKssTBhz5, Nintendo may have the next Splatoon project in the works under codename Spiral.</p>



<p>The leaker explains that after “researching the data I have received in the last month,” the project is “very likely” the next Splatoon installment. @MbKKssTBhz5 had no further details about the game. </p>



<p>Notably, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797461652713168966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also mentioned</a> they will have to be “careful now with Nintendo information.” So, they may not offer many more updates about Spiral. </p>



<p>@MbKKssTBhz5 has reported a variety of key leaks, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEGA’s upcoming projects</a> for Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. Recently, the leaker also supported claims about a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-frontiers-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Frontiers sequel</a>.</p>



<p>For now, Splatoon fans can now enjoy the new <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1796980295222104112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sizzle Season 2024</a>. This update adds new weapons, stages, and gear. There will also be a Summer Nights Splatfest event, an Ultra Stamp Festival, and more.</p>



<p>Nintendo recently confirmed that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Direct showcase</a> is coming in June, though it won’t be a platform for the Switch 2 announcement. It’s intended to cover a lineup of Switch games for the “second half of 2024.” So, Nintendo may not confirm anything about Codename Spiral or Splatoon during the event.</p>



<p>At this time, Nintendo has not officially confirmed anything about a new entry in the Splatoon series.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has revealed Project G-Assist, a program designed to help PC users by giving them access to more game knowledge through the use of generative AI.</p><p>"Whether it's a new player trying a game for the first time, and overwhelmed by massive skill trees, or a seasoned veteran looking for that perfect weapon to min-max that DPS build, many of us spend hours researching, scouring the internet to learn, to dig deeper and ultimately enjoy more of what the game has to offer," Nvidia senior project manager Guillermo Siman said in the Project G-Assist pitch video. "This is where Project G-Assist comes in. It uses AI to make sure information is readily available whenever we need it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsyJQWUUSs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdsyJQWUUSs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Siman added that G-Assist works by by taking in speech or a text prompt from a player and then adds context from the screen. This is then fed into a large language model enhanced by the developer's game-knowledge database, and these AI models can run on the cloud or can be locally accelerated by a GeForce RTX GPU. To demonstrate its potential, Nvidia has partnered with Studio Wildcard to demo the technology through Ark: Survival Ascended. Project G-Assist will help answer questions about creatures, items, lore, objectives, difficult bosses, and more in the survival game.</p><p>Where G-Assist could come in more handy on PC is through the optimization of games. While Nvidia does offer a PC-optimization tool through its GeForce Experience app, Project G-Assist could potentially fine-tune a gaming system for optimal performance and efficiency based on an individual user's hardware. Nvidia says that depending on the system, Project G-Assist could apply a safe overclock and even intelligently reduce power consumption while aiming to reach a performance target.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time that a company has attempted to evolve gaming guides and walkthroughs. The PlayStation 5 console launched with a Game Help feature meant to provide assistance in titles, although only a few games have provided in-depth guides through this option. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-game-help-feature-expands-expands-with-auto-recorded-clips-to-help-others/1100-6522150/">Sony also announced Community Game Help for PS5</a> in March, a new "enhancement" for Game Help utilizing user-generated content to help players out of difficult situations in games. It'll be going live later this year.</p>

Now, developer Larian Studios has said that the hit RPG is getting an official modding toolkit in an upcoming patch, and it's being released in a closed alpha so that mod authors can test it out and (ideally) adapt their existing mods to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" rel="nofollow ">blog post announcing</a> the upcoming patch clarifies that the closed alpha starts on June 3, to be followed by a closed beta targeting roughly 1,000 players in July. This official mod toolkit will release first on PC and roll out to Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox "shortly after," which is great news for console players. Larian is targeting a September launch for Patch 7, which will also include a number of other improvements and additions, including new evil endings and a number of other bug fixes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The post also features a lengthy Q&amp;A explaining what Baldur's Gate 3's native mod support will look like; in it, Larian notes that while the curated and officially supported mod channels will help these projects reach more players, some mods (such as NSFW ones) will have to remain outside of the pipeline. The studio also emphasized that it has no plans to limit modding outside of these official channels.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian also stated that other improvements will be coming to Baldur's Gate 3 in upcoming patches, including a photo mode and crossplay. Studio CEO Swen Vincke recently said the company's next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">codenamed Excalibur</a>, and that the team doesn't quite know what it is yet, so don't expect to play it anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/03/the-pc-adapter-for-playstation-vr2-arrives-this-august-with-some-drawbacks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/02/22/sony-testing-pc-support-for-playstation-vr2">After teasing PC support tests earlier this year</a>, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation's online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn't happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fallout-4-vr">Fallout 4 VR</a> and War Thunder.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a look at the minimum PC requirements to use PlayStation VR2 on your PC</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>However, as exciting as being able to use your PlayStation VR2 device on PC is, it comes with some distinct drawbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 – so you'll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC," the PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">post</a> reads. "However, other high-fidelity and sensory immersion features on PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games."&nbsp;</p>

<p>PlayStation says the most immersive way to experience PlayStation VR2 will remain the PS5, even after this PC adapter is available for purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To set up the PC adapter, you will have to connect PlayStation VR2 to your PC using the adapter and the DisplayPort 1.4 cable. After that, download the PlayStation VR2 App and the SteamVR app from Steam. This will allow you to set up the device on PC, customize your settings, and play SteamVR games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will be available for purchase starting August 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="363" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> launches its next expansion, <em>Dawntrail</em>, in just a few weeks, and it’s already announced some rather strange partnerships to celebrate Version 7.0 with brands like KFC and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/">Mountain Dew</a>. Though perhaps a little more appropriately, the MMORPG just revealed its collaboration with Secret Lab, the company behind all those flashy gamer chairs. </p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">The <em>FFXIV</em> gaming chair takes inspiration from some classic<em> Shadowbringers</em> iconography, using the <a href="https://secretlab.co/finalfantasy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secretlab Titan Evo</a> model as a base for its dark blue and gold flare. It’s also the first chair from Secret Lab to come with a few extra <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors/">glamour options</a>. You can change out the little magnets on the top left side, representing <em>FFXIV’s</em> Tank, Healer, or DPS Roles — thus making the chair a more flexible party member than me. </p>

 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Historically, the special edition Secret Lab chairs of the same model start around $624, almost $100 more than the standard chair from the company, so you’ll pay a premium for the branding. Other crossovers with games like <em>League of Legends</em> priced the lumbar pillows at $59; they’re sold separately from the Titan Evo. </p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail</em> launches on July 2, though you can get in through its early access period by pre-ordering the expansion. As for this chair, I’m not sure if you’ll have this thing in time for the big update, but we’ll update later as those details clear up. </p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It wasn’t that long ago that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-teases-illuminate-faction-again-following-incident-that-spaghettified-scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Earth successfully (?) spaghettified a team of scientists </a>to develop a new type of weapon, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have already gotten around to using it. Specifically, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-charged-with-completely-destroying-a-planet-an-irreversible-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent planetary destruction campaign</a> was a resounding success, and Meridia is now a black hole.</p> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Over the past couple of days, Helldiver forces were tasked with a unique Dark Fluid mission type. It consisted of <em>Helldivers 2</em> players taking the fight to the Terminid super-colony on Meridia and injecting canisters of the Fluid into the planetary core. While the operation was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6oil2/gone_but_not_forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no simple feat</a>, Helldiver fireteams were successful in the end, and Meridia is now permanently spaghettified, from the looks of it. According to Super Earth, what was once Meridia is now a <em>humongous</em> black hole, but something may be amiss here.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-meridia-is-now-a-black-hole-or-something-like-it" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2’s Meridia is now a black hole or something like it</h2> <p data-characters="643" data-current-count="943" data-injectable="true">While the jury is still out on whether the former planet of Meridia truly is a black hole or not, the visual representation of the anomaly itself may remind veteran <em>Helldivers</em> players of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-helldivers-content-is-missing-from-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the infamous third faction from the first game</a>: the Illuminate. The aesthetic is, broadly, on point, as the Illuminate used to leverage dark energy portals to move around the battlefield, and this is most definitely <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-cant-take-all-the-illuminate-teases-from-the-devs-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>not</em> the first hint of Illuminate presence </a>we’ve seen so far. The Meridia operation’s Dark Fluid had to come from somewhere, right? To say nothing of the strange murmurs that can be heard coming from the “black hole”.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Depending on how (un)lucky you are, you may have already fallen victim to one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s biggest question marks yet: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-capture-footage-of-mysterious-assailants-striking-them-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the strange blue lasers</a> that strike players down out of nowhere every so often. There’s a <em>lot</em> to suggest that the long-anticipated return of the Illuminate faction is almost upon us, then, even if we don’t <em>really</em> have any hard information on the when, what, how, and why of the event. As with many such things, developer Arrowhead Games is keeping cards close to its chest, but the writing seems to be on the wall at last.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">It’s a good thing, too, as <em>Helldivers 2</em> is yet to receive its next major update, which is supposed to revert the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-dev-plans-to-tone-down-heavy-enemy-spawn-rates-and-health-following-balance-patch-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excessive enemy spawns</a> among other ongoing issues. Between <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-new-mech-is-a-hotly-contested-topic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the relatively mild reception to the new mech</a> and the aforementioned spawning problems, there’s a lot of stuff that requires Arrowhead Games’ attention.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Since the studio usually keeps <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/why-undocumented-patch-notes-should-be-the-norm-for-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tight lid on the most exciting pieces of content</a> coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, it’s entirely possible that the Illuminates could be a part of this future update. Certainly, all the pieces have fallen into place by now, but pushing out a whole new faction might prove to be particularly risky at this time. Only one way to find out what happens next!</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a>, Keighley fielded questions from excited gamers about which games would be appearing at the show, whether there would be any big reveals or surprises, and more.</p>

<p>If you're expecting major tentpole games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced"><em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to appear at the show, then Keighley says you'll be disappointed. None of those games will be part of SGF 2024, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=h0kgC67u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=ppi_g2NM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>fans, but&nbsp;<em>Delta&nbsp;</em>won't be shown during the SGF 2024 opening show.</figcaption></figure><p>Several fans asked Keighley about other games, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-among-us-2-new-screenshots">recently-resurfaced</a>&nbsp;<em>The Wolf Among Us 2&nbsp;</em>and Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, but Keighley said neither game will be appearing during the showcase.</p>

<p>These no-shows tie into another question that a fan asks Keighley, namely whether SGF and The Game Awards are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead">replacing E3</a>. Keighley says this isn't the case, and given the apparent lack of major showstopping announcements during this year's Summer Game Fest opener, it's hard to disagree.</p>

<p>Although there may not be any major reveals, Keighley says there will be shadowdrops during the presentation, and he also says that we should get to hear about some games we didn't already know about, which is always nice.</p>

<p>However, Keighley points to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs">industry-wide layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">studio closures</a> as proof that the industry in general has been struggling recently, which could be one of the reasons we're not getting quite as many big names at SGF this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=KQT4aYk1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=fvU6EQfH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several high-profile studios have been closed down in recent months.</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1797506575818797291" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that the Summer Game Fest show itself will be around 2 hours long, and that it'll be followed by a Day of the Devs show, with Devolver Direct following on immediately after that.</p>

<p>During SGF 2024, we can expect to see a mixture of new game reveals and games we already knew about, although Keighley says the show will focus mainly on existing games, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gameplay-characters"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's worth watching Keighley's full Q&amp;A session, as he's got some interesting tidbits to share not only about SGF itself, but also about some of the other presentations you might see during the summer period. Stay tuned for all the big (or otherwise) SGF announcements as and when we get them.</p>

Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166879/sony-psvr2-pc-support-adapter-certification-filing">a certification revealed that Sony was working on the adapter</a>, which would add PC support to the PS5-exclusive headset, the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">officially unveiled the connector</a>. It launches on August 7th and will cost $59.99.</p></div><p>Sony says the device will support all Steam VR games, including big-name titles like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>. In addition to the new adapter, Sony says players will need a DisplayPort cable to work with Steam titles on PC. (As well as a Steam account, obviously.) You can check out the minimum system requirements <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">right here</a>.</p><p>In a blog post, Sony explains that there will be some feature differences depending on whether you’re playing on PS5 or PC:</p><div><blockquote><p>PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 — so you’ll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC. However, other high-fidelity and sensory immersion features of PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sony originally confirmed PC support was coming to the device <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079928/sony-psvr2-pc-support-2024">back in February</a>, which would allow PSVR 2 owners to connect the device to a PC to play non-PlayStation games. At the time, it didn’t reveal any timing beyond a vague 2024. That reveal came almost exactly a year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">after the headset launched</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An artist is working on an unofficial The Legend of Zelda NES remake within Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>YouTuber and digital artist '<a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LloydEmpty">Lloyd Empty</a>' is working on his own fan remake of the original The Legend of Zelda within Epic's most recent gaming engine, and although this is a work-in-progress, this early footage shows promise. The art style is comparable with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-as-good-as-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019's Link's Awakening Remake</a> for the Nintendo Switch, and in all honesty, it looks quite great.</p>
<p>According to the French artist, in order to create this remake, he used Blender, Gimp, and FMOD (and of course, Unreal Engine). Those who've played the original NES game from 1986 will surely recognize the footage.</p>
<p>We've included the new gameplay footage of this The Legend of Zelda NES fan remake below. Be sure to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda Nes Remake Gameplay Beta v0.7.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wywTYTFJA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two years ago, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdfCaPKHm6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artist already released footage</a> of a playable beta, but as far as we know, this beta hasn't been released publicly. Whether a full release will ever be made available for the public is unclear.</p>
<p>Released in 1986 for the original NES, The Legend of Zelda is considered as one of the most influential games ever created. The game was ported to various other Nintendo platforms and is currently available on the Nintendo Switch as part of Nintendo Switch Online. Although we don't have exact numbers, the first entry in the Zelda series has sold well over 6 million copies.</p>
<p>In case you're into these Unreal Engine-remakes of Zelda entries, be sure to check out this <a href="https://wccftech.com/ocarina-of-time-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UE5 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, which looks astonishing in Epic's engine complete with water physics and more.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset will finally become usable on PC soon, thanks to an official adapter that will be released in a few months.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC adapter</a>, which will be released for an estimated retail price of $59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99 at select retailers and PS Direct on August 7th, will also require a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4 as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum system requirements, which are not particularly high, although for the best results, Sony recommends an RTX 3060 or Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card. Setup also promises to be painless, as users will only be required to connect the headset to a PC and then download the<br>
PlayStation VR2 App and SteamVR App from Steam.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using the PlayStation VR2 headset on PC won't deliver the same experience as on PlayStation 5 since some of its key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking and adapting triggers, and haptic feedback, won't be supported. However, 4K visuals, a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering, will be supported.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch on August 7th worldwide. You can learn more about the headset and some of its unique features in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>

Eddie Brock and his symbiote partner in crime Venom are shown beating up (and eating) baddies just like they always have. But it’s clear the third movie is going to escalate not once, but twice, as Eddie and Venom’s antics have caught the attention of some government forces and they’re forced to become fugitives But that’s the least of their worries, as aliens from Venom’s home planet have also come to Earth in pursuit of the duo. There’s a whole fight scene between the two and a real ugly beastie on top of of a plane. So it seems like these aliens will make their getaway plans a bit more complicated.</p><p>A lot of the dialogue in the trailer and the movie’s title makes it sound like this could be the last <em>Venom </em>movie, but given that these are the only movies Sony has been putting out in its store brand MCU knock-off that do well in the only way studio suits understand (money), I’d be surprised if that ends up being the case. But whatever happens to the <em>Venom</em> franchise, at least <em>The Last Dance </em>will give us a sick scene of Tom Hardy riding a symbiote horse. That’s fun.</p><p> The real question is: how much do we think <em>The Last Dance </em>will bring up Eddie and Venom’s cameo in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860"><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a></span>? There’s a shot in the trailer of what looks like Chiwetel Ejiofor’s character retrieving the piece of symbiote left at the end of that movie, which I would have thought would have far-reaching effects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but now I’m curious if it will close that thread. It was a real fucking bummer that Tom Hardy spent that entire movie nowhere near the plot, and if <em>The Last Dance </em>ends up essentially erasing that from the MCU, that would be a shame. We’ll find out if that little detour had any real tangible effect on Eddie and Venom’s life when <em>The Last Dance </em>premieres on October 25. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirts pre-orders for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One will be going live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new turn of events, we see one of PlayStation’s titles come over to Xbox instead of the other way around. Ember Labs is releasing Kena: Bridge of Spirits on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One physically and digitally on August 15, 2024. The devs are collaborating with <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1797614812706271484/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Maximum Entertainment Retail</a> for the physical release, which provides the player with some bonus content. Xbox hasn’t provided a price tag for the game yet, but we should expect pre-orders at major retailers to go live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, through the physical copy, players can expect the base game, along with some bonus content. An official soundtrack and retail exclusive sticker sheet are available to add to your collection. In terms of in-game cosmetics, players can explore the world of the game while rocking a Unique Kena Staff and Golden Rot skins. Also, to celebrate the launch on the new platform, players will see an Xbox Exclusive pirate-themed Rot hat to claim too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a narrative-focused adventure. You play the role of a young Spirit Guide called Kena, who has set foot on a detailed journey towards the sacred Mountain Shrine. Along the way, you find trapped spirits that need to be rescued with the help of Rot. Rot is your cute companions that help you surpass various obstacles in your journey. Furthermore, the game also includes enjoyable, fast-paced combat, with some light platforming and engaging boss fights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be released in 2021 for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a>, along with PC via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kena-bridge-of-spirits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Epic Games Store.</a> Similar to what we have seen with other PlayStation titles such as Sifu, Stray, and Deathloop, to name a few, the game was a timed exclusive.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Kena: Bridge of Spirts on Xbox? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding blog</a> from PlayStation, Sony also mentioned that the anticipated PC adapter will have an estimated retail price of $59.99. It will be available “at select retailers and direct.playstation.com where available.”</p>



<p>This news shortly follows reports of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s certification license</a> for the adapter, which surfaced last week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s blog also reveals what users will need for the adapter. This includes a DisplayPort cable that works with DisplayPort 1.4, a Steam account, and a PC that meets minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Some of those requirements will include 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100, and a USB direct connection. And although the adapter was built for PlayStation 5, some key features are absent when you play on PC. Some examples include headset feedback and adaptive triggers.</p>



<p>The blog further warned fans that “performance may vary depending on your PC setup” and individual SteamVR title requirements.</p>



<p>In August, the new PlayStation PC adapter will give fans access to Steam’s extensive library of VR games. That includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx, Fallout 4 VR, and more.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sony also held a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> that teased over a dozen games coming to the PlayStation 5.</p>

                <p>If you were hoping to see one last surprise at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6521816/">Summer Game Fest Live</a>, Geoff Keighley has some bad news for you: What you see is what you get. In a <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent stream</a>, the host acknowledged that while a last surprise is often a tradition at game showcase events, this year's SGF will not have one.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not really one of those shows," Keighley explained. "Our shows don't typically have that." He noted that neither Gamescom Opening Night Live nor The Game Awards (two events that he's known for hosting) do not feature those sort of "bonus" announcements. However, he did say that the organizers put "a lot of thought" into the order of the reveals and trailers, from the first game to the last game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2Clscn0Jg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He then cited a humorous example, saying that those who expect Gabe Newell to walk out at the end and announce Half-Life 3 will be disappointed. "It'd be cool, but it's not happening on this show," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Summer Game Fest 2024 will take place on Friday, June 7 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The show will now take the spot formerly held by E3, the long-running video game trade show once seen as the premier event in gaming, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-permanently-canceled/1100-6519882/">permanently canceled</a> last year. While we don't know much about the event, we do know that it will feature a full reveal of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a VR game. Tickets to the physical event in Hollywood Park (Los Angeles) <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0A00606BE397250D" rel="nofollow ">are still being sold</a>.</p>

The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.</p>

<p>The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. Famed composer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2023/11/13/listen-to-three-songs-from-pennys-big-breakaway-the-next-game-from-the-team">Tee Lopes</a> (Shredder's Revenge, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_mania/b/xboxone/archive/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-game-informer-review.aspx">Sonic Mania</a>) is developing the game's soundtrack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>
