<p>God 'a do it</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>After a lengthy Early Access period, we now finally know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> will be arriving as a Switch 1 &amp; 2 timed console exclusive on <strong>25th September</strong> — that's next week!</p>
<p>It's exciting times for those of us who have been waiting for the full launch all this time, and to make sure that nobody misses a beat, Supergiant Games has announced the exact times that the god-like roguelike sequel will arrive on the Switch eShop in each region.</p>
<p>The times were shared in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lz54umuubc2e">BlueSky</a>, and we've assembled the following list so you know the appropriate time to hop onto the eShop wherever you are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9am PDT / 10am MDT / 11am CDT / 12pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6pm CEST / 7pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1am (Fri) JST / 12am (Fri) AWST / 2am (Fri) AEST</li></ul>


<p>As a reminder, Hades II will set you back <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> and there's even a free upgrade path to the 120fps Switch 2 edition if you opt for the S1 version at launch.</p>
<p>Those after the physical edition (which is complete-on-cart, we might add) will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on the game, with Supergiant announcing that boxes won't be hitting shelves until 20th November.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon-2000627131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon.1302735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>. Protection steps in if something goes amiss. That is, all your gadgets (whether the new iPhone 17, an iPad Pro, a Galaxy S25, or a Pixel phone) are charging without harm effectively.</p>
<p>If battery drain ever stranded or stressed you, grabbing this 50,000mAh power bank at its all-time lowest price is one of those genius purchases you won’t regret.</p>

                <p>The Borderlands franchise is known for its recurring characters, and perhaps none stand out quite as much as Claptrap. This loud and eccentric little robot has long since stood as the series' mascot for good reason, with his endearing charm and infectious good mood. But there's no denying he can be a bit loud at times--and that certainly hasn't changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>. But what if you could change that?</p><p>Claptrap may not be as prevalent in this new entry as he has been in some other titles in the looter shooter franchise, but his presence is still consistent enough in Borderlands 4 to warrant a rather unique slider among all the other settings. For those who find this quirky guy more of a nuisance than a lovable goof, Gearbox has added a way to adjust his volume separately from all other volumes. Yeah, you can shut Claptrap up altogether if you want.</p><p>We can sense your excitement, so we'll tell you how to turn down Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4.</p><h2>How to turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4</h2><p>To turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4, pause the game and head to the "Options" menu. Scroll over one time to "Audio", then select "Advanced". On this menu, scroll to the very bottom to find a setting called "Claptrap?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631"></a><figcaption>You can adjust Claptrap's volume to make him more tolerable, or you can reduce it to zero to shut him up entirely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, you can adjust Claptrap's voice to make him quieter, or you can decrease the volume to zero so you'll never hear a peep from him again. You'll still be able to read his subtitles so that you know what he's saying when you pick up certain collectibles or engage in quests with him, so you're not really missing anything by turning him all the way down.</p><p>Whether you decide to mute Claptrap is entirely up to you, but don't ever tell him you've taken these measures. He may be slightly annoying sometimes, but the poor little guy doesn't deserve to have his feelings hurt.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4 </a>works wonders on Steam Deck, introducing significant image quality improvements in select games that make the performance hit more than worth it in most cases.</p>



<p>New comparison videos shared online by Deck Wizard compare <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> running on Steam Deck with AMD FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5. The side-by-side comparison of both games highlights how the new version of the upscaler, which has only recently unofficially become available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>, delivers significantly cleaner and sharper image quality than its predecessor, making the performance hit well worth it in most cases. While both games are best experienced at 60 FPS - especially Stellar Blade, given its action-focused gameplay—the improvements already visible at this early stage suggest that FSR 4's implementation on the handheld platform has strong potential and may only get better with further optimization.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>AMD FSR 4 is the first version of the upscaler to go the full <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-fidelityfx-super-resolution-ai-follows-nvidia-dlss-intel-xess-better-visual-fidelity/">"AI" route</a>, following NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS in using machine learning to improve image quality and performance of modern games. Initially only available for RX 9000 series GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to use the new version of the upscaler on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RDNA 3</a> and RDNA 2 through a leaked INT8 version of FSR 4's source code, which can be manually implemented using tools like <a href="https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler">OptiScaler</a>. Although with a performance hit, the upscaler still delivers significantly better image quality on this old hardware.</p>



<p>More information on AMD FSR 4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html">official website.</a></p>

              <p><span>In the wake of the assassination last week of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and other reactionary movements have wielded the act as a tool to silence critics of Kirk’s views, and those who are critical of the Trump administration more broadly. One of the most highly publicized instances of this was Disney-owned ABC’s pulling of </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i><span>, following pressure from the FCC, after the talk show ran a segment that said the Trump administration had latched onto the event in order to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA"><span>“score political points.”</span></a><span> In response, several public figures have spoken out in protest, including some actors who have prominently worked for Disney by appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p> <p><span>Marisa Tomei, who plays Spider-Man’s Aunt May in the superhero franchise, took to Instagram to urge people to boycott Disney, including the Marvel movies she starred in, from </span><i><span>Captain America: Civil War </span></i><span>in 2016 to </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home </span></i><span>in 2021. May was killed in the last </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>movie by the Green Goblin, and given that her death was a thematic pillar of the film, it was unlikely that Tomei would have been asked to reprise the role, but still, speaking out against one of the most powerful companies in modern media isn’t nothing.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marisa Tomei reshares post urging for the boycott of Disney brands. <a href="https://t.co/7Ni0CSu3ui">pic.twitter.com/7Ni0CSu3ui</a></p> <p>— Buzzing Pop (@BuzzingPop) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzingPop/status/1968833688759591240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Meanwhile Tatiana Maslany, the actor behind the titular hero of </span><i><span>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</span></i><span>, posted on social media urging people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Maslany’s post was even more pointed, with her Instagram story featuring a photo of her in a motion capture suit while shooting the </span><i><span>She-Hulk </span></i><span>series.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>"Has the PC porting kind of slowed down recently? Am I imagining that, or [has] there just [not] been too many games for them to port?" Minotti asked of Grubb.</p><p>Minotti noted that Bloodborne can't move because developer From Software must be involved with the project and the studio is busy--presumably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/" data-ref-id="5000-671285">The Duskbloods</a>, and whatever else Hidetaka Miyazaki's scary mind is cooking up. Grubb agreed with this notion, adding that it seems like "[From doesn't] want to do it with Sony." He extrapolated on this point a bit more.</p><p>"Anything beyond From Software would have to be involved and they're not going to do it right now, I don't know," Grubb said. "But that's my understanding of the situation and it continues to be that way. I checked in on it relatively recently and kind of continue to hear, 'Nothing is happening with Bloodborne, so don't expect that.'"</p><p>In confusion, Grubb and Minotti couldn't make sense of why the 2020 remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demons-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-513796">Demon's Souls</a> and the 2022 racing sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gran-turismo-7/" data-ref-id="5000-513781">Gran Turismo 7</a> aren't already on PC. But the one that really tripped them up was a Bloodborne remake, which fans have been clamoring for.</p><p>Bloodborne doesn't need much of an introduction. However, if you can believe it, it's been 10 years since the acclaimed Lovecraftian action-RPG graced our PS4s. Unfortunately, it's been locked on that ancient hardware ever since, with nary a peep about it leaving that vault. Miyazaki has remained tight-lipped about a potential remake for the cult favorite, but he did say in February 2024 that the new hardware--namely, the PS5--could give a theoretical remake some "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/" data-ref-id="1100-6521268">value</a>."</p><p>Although the value proposition Miyazaki proposed as a result of more powerful hardware sounds enticing, what this means in relation to Bloodborne is moot, considering there's been little movement on a port or remake for forever now. While a former PlayStation executive has theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">Miyazaki is likely too busy for a Bloodborne remake</a>--or a remaster or a 60fps update or some kind of morsel--Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">taken action against a fan-made patch</a> that added a higher frame rate to the legendary soulslike.</p><p>It truly does feel like Bloodborne is stuck in a grave, never to be resuscitated ever again. But as the saying goes, never say never. There's no official confirmation; however, you can never rule out the impossible. Maybe Miyazaki and friends are just waiting for the right time, or maybe Sony is looking for Miyazaki to pick the right team. Either way, though there's no movement right now, that doesn't mean there won't ever be movement. Patience is a virtue.</p><p>In other From Soft news, Nightrein just receieved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">a new Deep of Night mode</a> that makes the game even harder than it already was.

			<p>Team Reptile, the studio behind the Jet Set Radio-inspired Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has just revealed its next game, Hyperfunk, which looks to be another fast-paced, music-infused, combo-focused rush. It'll be coming to PC and consoles when it's ready, but at the time of this writing, no release date or release window has been announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Team Reptile's <a href="https://team-reptile.com/hyperfunk-reveal/">website</a>, with a post that included a short description of the game and a teaser trailer, showing off a small snippet of gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Reptile's new game is called Hyperfunk</em>," the post reads. "<em>An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Official HYPERFUNK Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDzg_j6nCsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's clear from the trailer that Team Reptile is working to further refine what it did in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, focusing once again on fluid movement and trick-centric gameplay. It'll be interesting to see how else Hyperfunk evolves on the studio's previous work, and hopefully, we'll have a release date to look forward to soon.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/">reviewed Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> when it launched back in 2023, we wrote "<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is a game that's clearly wearing its inspiration on its sleeve. With mechanics that are pretty easy to get into and a great soundtrack to boot, fans of Jet Set Radio and 3D platformer games in general should feel very pleased. While the game has some shortcomings that prevent it from being a masterpiece, it still delivers some memorable beats.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Zack here, filling in as your host today for your regularly scheduled Ethan edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. Let’s get through this thing together, and then at the end we can listen to some music and celebrate the upcoming weekend.</p> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> contains a big list of licensed songs and a lot of Limb Bizkit</strong></h2> <p>According to a new <em>Battlefield 6</em> leak, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1968725668042063960">as reported by <em>Battlefield Bulletin</em>,</a> the upcoming military shooter contains a surprisingly large list of licensed music. <em>BF Bulletin</em> says these songs will be played on the radio when driving in-game vehicles, but EA has yet to confirm any of this. Here’s the track listing, which contains three different songs credited to Limp Bizkit. Seriously.</p> <ul> <li>“Awake” – Godsmack</li> <li>“Bodies” – Drowning Pool</li> <li>“Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers</li> <li>“Domination” – Pantera</li> <li>“Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid</li> <li>“Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter</li> <li>“Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy</li> <li>“Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Master of War” – Bob Dylan</li> <li>“Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</li> <li>“Pain” – Chalk</li> <li>“You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison</li> <li>“Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman &amp; Limp Bizkit</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iCEGrHGmb1o">one of the listed Limp Bizkit songs was uploaded to Limp Bizkit’s official YouTube channel last week</a>. And the artwork for the song includes the singer on a tank that has <em>BF6</em> graffiti on it and the song’s credits list EA Music.&nbsp; So, yeah, I think we can deduce that this list is probably accurate.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">When I traveled to Los Angeles earlier this year</a> to attend the game’s big multiplayer reveal, I was shocked that its big trailer featured the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff.” I assumed it was a fun joke or a one-off thing. But it seems like EA and the people making <em>Battlefield 6</em> have partnered up with Limp Bizkit in some capacity, and folks, I’m not sure how I feel about any of this.</p> <h2><strong>Intel is still going to make its own GPUs following the Nvidia deal</strong></h2> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that GPU maker and tech giant Nvidia was partnering up with Intel as part of a large, long-term plan. Nvidia is investing billions into Intel and the two will work together on new products. Wild stuff. And if you were wondering if this meant the end of Intel’s own GPUs, that doesn’t seem to be the case for now. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-arc-gpus-arent-going-anywhere-just-yet-despite-the-new-nvidia-collaboration/">As <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, Intel still has plans to keep making Intel Arc cards for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>

 <h2><strong>It seems like you can just buy a Switch 2 on Amazon now</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve been wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, well, it’s pretty easy to do now. As pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-for-sale-on-amazon-no-invite-required-132503609.html">Engadget</a></em>, Amazon is now selling the console in the United States without any waiting list or hoops to jump through. You just fork over $500 and wait a couple of days, and there you go. I’ve also seen multiple Switch 2 units at my local Target. So it seems like you’ll be able to snag a Switch 2 without much effort ahead of the holidays.</p> <h2><strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>‘s excellent soundtrack now available on Nintendo’s Music app</strong></h2> <p>I’m so mad at myself that I’ve not finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. And a big reason for that is because I miss listening to the 3D smasher-jumper, which has one of the best Nintendo soundtracks in years. Thankfully, the songs are now available on the Nintendo Music app. Now, I just need to find time to finish that game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and the big button that blows everything up</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Law enforcement is reportedly digging into the gaming history of Charlie Kirk’s killer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">The legal battle between Sony and Tencent over a knock-off <em>Horizon</em> game continues</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>Sure, why not?</p>  
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaked-song-limp-bizkit-songs-intel-nvidia-gpu-switch-2-amazon-2000627132]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-11-0-is-now-available-for-download-improves-emulation-of-unreal-engine-games.1302636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4</a> PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for select games.</p>



<p>The 0.11.0 version, which can now be downloaded from the emulator's official website, introduces several technical changes and improvements that, by themselves, don't mean much to any regular user for the most part. In reality, these mark a significant improvement for the emulator regarding Unreal Engine-powered games, as many now boot on the emulator, and some are even in a playable state, although it will take a while to see the most advanced games run well on the emulator due to how technically demanding the engine is to emulate with complex shader pipelines and more. You can learn more about these changes with the official <a href="https://shadps4.net/post/shadps4-v0110-relased/">update notes.</a></p>



<p>The ShadPS4 emulator is the most advanced PlayStation 4 emulator available, and the one that is making the fastest progress among those in development. In just a few weeks last year, FromSoftware's Bloodborne, one of the most popular PlayStation 4 exclusive games that have yet to be ported to any other system, went from <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">barely bootable</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">fully playable even on dated systems</a> with better visuals and performance, thanks to the hard work of modders such as fromsoftserve who released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">visual overhaul </a>that is on par with many official remasters released in the past. After focusing on improving Bloodborne's emulation as much as possible, the emulator's developers have moved onto other PlayStation 4 exclusives, which the emulator is running better and better with each new release.</p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After an<a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/"> initial delay</a> that pushed the game out of the first half of 2025, Grimlore Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow-dropped</a> Titan Quest II in early access this summer and had a strong launch with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">300K copies sold in less than three days</a>. Now that the game has been out for a few months, Grimlore Games is preparing to release the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/508466096994518144">first major content update</a> for Titan Quest II, which will be in players' hands "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>The update will be Chapter 2 of the game's story and take players further into the Northern Beaches. You'll have to work to uncover the truth of Nemesis' plans while she continues to hunt you, and you try to find ways to become more than just a mortal if you want to be capable of defeating a god.</p>



<p>The new World Quests in the game will see you aid a crew of travelers who find themselves shipwrecked, which also turns into your own quest to find buried treasure. The update will also include a new chapter boss, Skylla, new enemies to defeat, and further refinements and tweaks to the game.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's no specific release date for when Chapter 2 will be available, nor are there more specific details on what'll be included, but Grimlore Games does have a roadmap for its early access plans that players can view to know what's coming next.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we'll have more specifics soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lethal League&nbsp;</em>developer Team Reptile has revealed its latest game&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, and if you're a fan of the studio's last effort, it looks like you're going to love this one as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is an "extreme trick and graffiti game" in which you must pull off stylish trick combos in order to build your boost and speed through the city.</p>

<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>takes place in a "bright future" in which society is built around an online space known as the Hyper and graffiti crews compete with one another regarding "how to interpret this new world".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=6b0rbfO3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=-MwxBttC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>studio Team Reptile.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em>, you'll likely recognize the visual style Team Reptile is going for with&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; this is very much a closely-related spiritual successor rather than a departure from existing styles.</p>

<p>Still, the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>shows a game that looks like it's built much more around speed, trick combos, and traversal than its predecessor was, so if you thought&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>could do with being more kinetic and speedy, you're in luck.</p>

<p>There's also an online component to&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; you can hang out with random players online in the Hyper, but if you prefer to keep things local to you and your friends, you can chill with them in the streets of the game's city as well.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, which shows off the game's very&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>-inspired visual aesthetic and gameplay style, right here. No "Fly Like a Butterfly", though, sadly.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date or even a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you like. Hopefully, this one doesn't get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-delayed-to-2023-for-polish" rel="nofollow">delayed like its predecessor did</a>, eh?</p>

<p>First convened in May 2024, the network are currently looking to connect Palestinian game devs with volunteers and funding partners. They'll provide administrative help to any developer trying to get access to funding, and assistance managing resources and volunteer contributions, once secured. They aim to follow and boost each project from "production to announcement to publication", and are already working with a range of smaller independent games, many of which explore recollections of pain and loss through speculative fiction and fantasy.

<p>As you might expect, the network is a response to Israel's on-going mass killing and dispossession of Palestinians in Gaza, which has now <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/israel-has-committed-genocide-in-the-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds-16sep25/">formally been defined as a genocide by a UN inquiry</a>, together with the long-term killing, oppression and mistreatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and inside Israel's own borders.
</p><p>
"The dehumanisation of Palestinians is tied to their rare visibility in the cultural sphere," the organisers note on <a href="https://palestinian-voices-in-games.com/">their website</a>. "This dehumanisation costs lives - as the world remains indifferent to the ongoing genocide in Gaza and to the surge of violent oppression across the West Bank and inside Israel.
</p>
<p>"We want to push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians, not simply through representation but also through professional and economic support, so that Palestinian game developers may tell their own stories and reach global audiences."

<p>Among the Palestinian game developers PVG are working with is Iasmin Omar Ata, whose forthcoming sci-fi adventure novel Being 2 is set in a Palestinian space colony. "You would have to fix the space colony during a black out, which would lead to flashbacks/hallucinations allowing to see past memories of Palestine," reads a summary from the developer's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlIa9Fa1lxJT6jgPrdioMoSrZsT77oAF/view?usp=sharing">portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>Another partner developer, Yusra, is working on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riyafagame/">RiYafa</a> (pictured in this article's header), an underwater experience "that combines testimony and symbolism to tell the story of her family and community based in the West Bank", in the words of a press release.
</p><p>Yasmine Batniji's Pomegranates is also set in the future. "Travel to the year 2048 and play as a memory keeper in the reclaimed and rebuilt Gaza City," reads the summary. "You will be tasked with tracing echoes of the current war at the renovated Al-Ahli hospital." You can find a version of it on <a href="https://gabbahbaya.itch.io/pomegranates">Itch.io</a>.

<p>Lastly, there's Rasheed Abueideh, creator of Liyla and the Shadows of War and the forthcoming Dreams on a Pillow. Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dreams-on-a-pillows-developer-on-the-challenges-of-making-games-from-the-west-bank">interviewed Abueideh about the latter game last year</a> - amongst other things, they discussed the absence of support structures for Palestinian game developers in the occupied West Bank. "You need to experiment many things, and you have to make many iterations to reach something that is beautiful and people can actually enjoy," Abueideh told Nic. "And to do this, you need an ecosystem that helps you."

<p>The games industry at large has a... complicated relationship with Palestine. While many large publishers <a href="https://newsroom.activisionblizzard.com/p/supporting-the-ukrainian-people-mar">halted</a> <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2dkkIG51BCP24JwGGvDry9/how-ubisoft-is-supporting-our-teams-and-the-people-of-ukraine">game</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/update-on-electronic-arts-titles-in-russia-and-belarus">sales</a> in Russia following the outbreak of a murderous invasion of Ukraine, there hasn't been a similar wave of divestment from Israel, even given some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/28/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-say-israel-based-human-rights-groups">well-supported accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide</a>.
</p><p>In particular, Microsoft and Xbox are the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">a boycott</a> in response to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">alleged collaborations</a> with the Israeli military to surveil and target Palestinians using cloud technology and generative AI. Nic and I recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of people participating in the boycott</a>, amongst them a former Microsoft developer who called attention to Microsoft's "double standard" toward internal discussion of Israel and Palestine. Microsoft declined to comment on this allegation when approached by RPS.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-went-for-the-iphone-7-this-official-2-pack-of-20w-chargers-costs-only-11.1302621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19</a>. That’s<strong> basically $6 per charger</strong>, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that <strong>Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box</strong>. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. It’s certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except you’re paying a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and y<strong>ou can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes</strong>. The<strong> included USB-C to USB-C cable</strong> ensures you’re set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and it’s Apple-certified for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>A <strong>USB-C and a USB-A port are both included</strong> in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.</p>
<p>Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a <strong>multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits</strong>. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.</p>
<p>At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends Z-A - The Biggest Pokemon Shake Up In Decades!</p>
      </div>
<p>Essentially, Nintendo is claiming that mods are "fair game" as they could be patented by someone else. Thus, the company fears that its gameplay ideas and innovations could similarly be lifted and used by anyone. As IGN noted on September 19, this is particularly worrying for the games industry because patent thieves could theoretically create entire games out of just mods.</p><p>The problem here, though, is that Nintendo's "ideas" and "innovations" aren't novel. Pokemon has been around for decades, and as Games Fray reported, the ideas the company filed patents for in 2021 weren't new, either.</p><p>Pocketpair, for its part, has purported that Palworld and Pokemon are fundamentally different beasts. Sure, they both start with "p," and they feature monsters you can capture in balls, but one is an open-world action game and the other is a more traditionally turn-based affair. This, alongside the notion that Palworld isn't merely a modded Pokemon no matter how much it may look like it, is perhaps why Pocketpair is confused by the lawsuit.</p><p>Palworld is out now on PC, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Meanwhile, the next Pokemon games are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokopia</a>. The former is a continuation of the Pokemon Legends series that launches on October 16, while the latter is a life sim not unlike an Animal Crossing title that comes out sometime next year. Both will, of course, be available on Nintendo Switch 1 and 2.</p>

            <p>When you push the right controller stick forwards, do you expect a game camera to move up or down? Whether players use "normal" or "inverted" camera controls has long been a point of debate.</p>
<p>Now, though, it's part of a scientific study. As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think">The Guardian</a>, Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke at Brunel University London initiated a study during lockdown into the neuroscience of human-computer interactions using remote subjects, speaking with players to research controller inversion.</p>
<p>The duo have now published their findings in their paper "Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments". And the results are all about how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.</p>
<p>"Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not," said Corbett. "Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback."</p><p>Participants were given a questionnaire and tasked with experiments around spatial awareness. "They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical 'Simon effect' where it's harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button," Corbett explained.</p>
<p>"It turns out the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert."</p>
<p>Yet while inverted players were the slowest on the tasks, they were also more accurate.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while players think they choose controls based on their first exposure, it's more likely due to your brain's perception of objects in 3D space.</p>
<p>Corbett even suggested players should try the opposite way to what they're used to. "The most surprising finding for gamers [who don't invert] is that they might perform better if they practised with an inverted control scheme," said Corbett. "Maybe not, but given our findings, it's definitely worth a shot because it could dramatically improve competitive game play!"</p><p>What's more, the research could have implications outside of gaming. "This work opened our eyes to the huge potential that optimising inversion settings has for advancing human-machine teaming," says Corbett. "So many technologies are pairing humans with AI and other machines to augment what we can do alone. Understanding how a given individual best performs with a certain setup (controller configuration, screen placement, whether they are trying to hit a target or avoid an obstacle) can allow for much smoother interactions between humans and machines in lots of scenarios from partnering with an AI player to defeat a boss, to preventing damage to delicate internal tissue while performing a complicated laparoscopic surgery."</p>
<p>Personally, inverting camera controls is the first thing I do when booting up a new game. I always presumed it's because that's how I learned to play as a kid - just as Corbett said - but perhaps it's actually my brain after all.</p>
<p>Are you an inverter or non-inverter for gaming controls? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-condition-took-away-the-use-of-my-hands-silksong-helped-me-rehab-them.1302600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year I woke up with the hands of an alien. Every item I grasped fell to the floor like so many grains of sand; every doorknob became a lock I couldn’t open. It didn’t hurt, but hundreds of dollars of scans later I learned my tendons were full of tiny holes, multiple ligaments were sprained, and my nerves suffered from a syndrome that sounds like a <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Double_Crush_Syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passable emo band name</a>. <em>It’s not unusual you didn’t feel anything</em>, my physical therapist told me. <em>In life or death situations adrenaline can mask the body’s sensations</em>. My husband had just survived cardiac arrest, and in taking on our chores, I’d dislocated joint after joint and shredded tendons like fragile threads, revealing a condition I’d long suspected but hadn’t confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Of all the big and small things we hoped for during recovery, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silksong</em>’s release</a> became weirdly totemic. I kept telling myself that surely I’d be healed by the time it came out, even as every follow-up scan simply revealed another injury in the wasteland of constant dislocations. <em>Silksong</em> announcements are so elusive; maybe my husband’s condition would even be healed upon the game’s eventual release. Probably, it would never come out. I’d spent the prior years editing at Polygon, participating in the inside joke of <em>should we update the </em>Silksong <em>article outline in case it’s announced?</em> before communally deciding it was unlikely.</p><p>Two rounds of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/plateletrich-plasma-prp-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRP injections</a>, a rotating door of exercises and medications, and finally life looks like a withered approximation of its prior self. And, just my luck, Team Cherry’s hit sequel arrived with two weeks' notice. <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie studios pushed their games back</a> in terror of being overlooked. Swaddled in our cocoon of chronic illness, I thought only of myself. Like a marathon runner butting up against a race she hasn’t trained for, I agitated about the lack of lead time I would have to prepare for a game this demanding. My hands, those dumb little paperweights, had only begun things like “chopping vegetables” or “typing on an ergonomic keyboard” a few months ago. Fine motor control was an event horizon I could hardly imagine, and yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My physical therapist told me I could play <em>Silksong</em>, just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23297244/elden-ring-hollow-knight-completion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not like I’d played <em>Hollow Knight</em></a>. This time I had to take ample breaks for something called proper tendon loading; playing it this way would even be beneficial for my recovery. In <em>Hollow Knight</em>, I’d simply thrown myself at boss fights repeatedly until I found the most direct way forward. I was so fixated on boss rushing that I hardly poked around the game’s map. But exploration is what finally yielded the game’s numerous pathways and secrets to me, elevating Hallownest into the land of favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve made my way through Pharloom, I’ve had to focus more on adaptability, giving up early before damaging hand fatigue as enemies whip two masks out of Hornet’s silk-starved body. I thought slowing down would dampen my enjoyment, but it’s made the game better. I notice more. I find more. I hunt for environmental clues, like deadly little arm bangles or a skeletal horse jumping over fiery ground. These novel attempts at moving forward have gifted me new regions and abilities, with the ultimate upside of flashpan moments of discovery and delight. It’s a counterbalance to the game’s punishing difficulty.</p><p>For the bosses I can’t weasel around, I lean on the humble nap. I’ve learned how to “pace,” the chronic illness community’s way of managing fatigue by planning ample breaks in advance. I give up early, hoping tomorrow it will be easier. Hornet’s moveset has a subtly different feel from the Knight’s, with her taller height, shorter dash, and toolkit. It took a few sleeps for it to sink in, but then again I am remembering how to use a controller in a very literal sense, which is to say coordinating basic walking and jumping.&nbsp;</p><p>My hands occasionally betray me with frissons of neuropathy that shuttle me into a knife-throwing Craw. I own an Xbox Adaptive Controller and the dongle that lets me use it with a Switch Pro Controller, and I plan on using it if I find any of these hurdles insurmountable. But an entirely new controller setup is another learning curve that will take me time to understand. I suspect a mix of both old and new setups will be the most sustainable in the long run. Mostly I’m glad to have options, and the patience to take my time figuring them out in <em>Silksong</em>’s world.</p><p>If doubling back bothered me, I would not be able to live in my own body, which flares and tears sometimes without warning. You can live life with this sort of condition in a state of grief, in constant fear of movement. Or you can celebrate every gain, knowing that you might not be able to consistently replicate it. The story of my guiding Hornet through the Marrow over and over — to collect supplies, fulfill Wishes, or simply uncover her dead body — is the same story as my fight to open a fucking jar. This fight started in May 2024 and, depending on which jar you ask, is still ongoing. I lived a year of having to decide whether it was more worthy of my limited stamina to hold my husband in a tight embrace or unclasp cold, tightened takeout containers to heat us up a meal. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I am no stranger to weakness that, with the benefit of hindsight, is actually immense strength.&nbsp;</p><p>It is pleasurable to finally pick my failures, and just as pleasurable to experience the joy of success. It’s also true that <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s failures are exceptionally funny. The series always had a mean streak: The Soul Master has a final round of fighting after a convincing fake out. Mirabelle the banker scams you out of Geo. <em>Silksong</em>’s miserly dramatics have only gotten funnier to me. Enemies that dodge your attacks more effectively? A booby-trapped bench that hurts you at a moment you really could have used healing? I have spent hours laughing, crying, laughing over the absurdity of getting stuck outside my own apartment, while holding the keys, because the gate is too heavy for me to open. Life has a mean streak.</p><p>The thrill I feel climbing Far Fields with my floating cape, beating a room of ants in Hunter’s March, or taking my first ride on the Bell Beast is even greater now, in the context of everything I have lost. It reminds me of how much my husband and I have clawed back from this tortuous phase of life, when washing our own hair felt like a cause for celebration. The more <em>Silksong</em> I’ve played, the more coordinated my daily movements of living have become. Meal prepping is a little easier; typing certainly is. It’s deeply imperfect– I’m in the middle of another week-long tendon deloading break after fighting a disgusting giant fly, but I would take breaks over long stretches of injury. To play a game at all is a pleasure. To play <em>Silksong</em>, however slowly and punishingly, is a joy.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls"><h3>Months After Microsoft Layoffs, Zenimax Unions Never Stopped Fighting For Impacted Workers</h3></a><p>They won more time at the company, improved severance, recall rights, and saved a few jobs</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/silksong-hollow-knight-rehab]]></content:encoded>

<p>UK, Australia, and the US affected</p>

<p>Eager <strong>Trails</strong> fans, old and new, are getting their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> today, the remake of the 2004 RPG from Falcom that kicked off the Trails series. With Limited Run Games and Clear River Games handling Steelbook and Bracer Editions, a lot of love and care seems to have gone into this remake.</p>
<p>But today, both physical edition publishers have revealed that they've hit issues in getting those special editions in the hands of some customers (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lz6vmo4zuc23">Wario64</a>)</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has been emailing those who pre-ordered the game about "unexpected manufacturing delays" for both the steelbook and Bracer Edition, and that these will now be "shipping out later than the initially planned date of September 19, 2025."</p>

<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), European distributor <a href="https://x.com/clearrivergames/status/1968993500042547307?s=19">Clear River Games states</a> that "We began fulfilling all Trails in the SKy steelbook orders earlier this week, despite the games arriving at our warehouse later than expected due to production delays."</p>
<p>While it has managed to ship orders across the EU, the UK, Australia, and other regions, "complications with our shipping partner" have caused other regions to be hit by delays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Clear River says it has finally found a solution, and the remaining orders will be shipped today. Hopefully this bodes well for Limited Run Games pre-orders too.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the wait isn't too long for those of you who are big Trails fans — the remake has been getting rave reviews, and this is the perfect entry point for newcomers, too.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like we're essentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-contains-teaser-for-the-sequel">guaranteed to get a remake of the sequel</a>, given what footage has been shared online by those who go to the game early.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-new-sony-model-out-1000xm4-plunges-to-an-all-time-low-on-amazon.1302576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding the right pair of noise-canceling headphones can feel overwhelming these days: Every brand has half a dozen variations, and the differences are often so subtle that paying top dollar for the latest release is tough to justify.</p>
<p>Sony’s newest flagship climbs well past the $500 mark which isn’t exactly pocket change. That’s why the WH-1000XM4 feels like such an easy decision right now: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">this proven model is back on Amazon at an all-time low of $228, down from its original $348</a>. That’s more than $100 off for headphones that still strike the perfect balance of sound quality and features without being too expensive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why The WH-1000XM4 Still Feels Like The Smart Choice</h2>
<p>Its <strong>active noise cancellation</strong> remains among the best you can purchase: Powered by Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology, it uses microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate unwelcome sounds in real-time. On a plane, it calms the engine rumble to a whisper. In a busy café, it creates a bubble of silence around you so that you can actually hear the lyrics in your music or podcasts.</p>



<p>Sony quotes these headphones for 30 hours of playback which will even get you through the longest international flights without needing a charge. And just in case you do leave them uncharged, a ten-minute top-up from the included USB-C cable yields about five hours of music.</p>
<p>Controls are simple too: The touch on the right earcup means you can tap to skip tracks or pause, slide your finger for volume, or summon your assistant without having to grasp your phone. It’s the sort of thing that becomes second nature and saves time compared to digging for your phone every time you need to fiddle with something. Calls on the WH-1000XM4 are better than that: With five microphones built in and sophisticated signal processing, voices are clean on both sides.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant Sony touches is the Speak-to-Chat function: The <strong>cans naturally lower the volume when they recognize you’re talking</strong>. Imagine bumping into a friend on the platform of the train. You don’t have to fight for a pause button: the audio slows down so you naturally have a few words, then picks up again when the talk ends. Pausing the sound when you remove the cans entirely is another nice but very useful addition.</p>
<p>At $228, this deal on Amazon brings them to their lowest price ever.</p>
