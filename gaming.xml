<p>The "Strange Tales of Modern Science" mission, meanwhile, has players investigating a nearby "man of science" who claims he created artificial life near Braithwaite Manor. "Bring the strange experiment to life by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight," reads a line from the mission's description.</p><p>Then there is the "Strange Tales of The Bayou" mission that has players seeking "something unholy" in the swamps of Lagras. Finally, the "Strange Tales of the Wilderness" mission involves meeting up with a scientist who is conducting "strange research" on people in Tall Trees. "When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202" data-ratio="0.54190476190476" data-width="2100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202"></a><figcaption>Strange indeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png"></figure><p>These new missions pay out 3X gold, RDO$, and XP through August 4.</p><p>Red Dead Online did not become the kind of phenomenon that GTA Online did for GTA 5, with fans saying Rockstar did not support the online mode as much as they would have liked to see.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> is out and as you can imagine, people are having a good time making their way through the free-to-play RPG. However, they've been confronted with what may be the most peculiar Atlus villain of all time: The Subway Slammer.</p>
<p>The Subway Slammer is a major antagonist in P5X's initial chapter. He's basically just a guy who shoulder charges women on the subway. No one does anything about it, leaving him to continue tormenting innocent people.</p>
<p>This may all sound a little random, but it's very much based on reality. Men who intentionally ram into people (usually women) in a manner they can then claim is an accident are dubbed "Butsukari otoko", or bumping man". It's a real, weird, horrible thing!</p>

<figcaption>It's the Subway Slammer!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CU2-2hfX_8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The community reaction to the Subway Slammer is mixed. Some are genuinely underwhelmed by what is a relatively inconsequential villain compared to other antagonists in the series. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyxunc2m">Lillie on BlueSky</a>, in reaction to the Subway Slammer's dialogue, wrote: "this looks like something someone would edit onto the textbox just as a joke".</p>
<p>Others find the absurdity of the Subway Slammer hilarious it seems. <a href="https://x.com/EXILEDpepsii/status/1939423712501272627">Memes are flooding online spaces</a>, with folks placing the Subway Slammer well above other antagonists from other properties.</p>
<p>Now you might think that people making memes about a Subway Slammer are a little bit out of line right? Persona games have featured themes of real-world problems, and the Subway Slammer is no different! <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/crime/%27bumping-men%27-are-a-uniquely-japanese-class-of-criminals-that-are-hard-to-deal-with">According to Japan Today</a>, "the severity of the bump - or in some cases even a punch - can vary quite a bit as does the purpose, whether releasing some sort of aggression, as a form of molestation, or in an attempt to claim the victim damaged an item of theirs".</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The problem is you can't necessarily blame people for finding the depiction in P5X ridiculous, in part due to how it is portrayed. Yes, the Subway Slammer does hurt people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyzjes2m">but he also states</a>: "the whole Subway is mine for the Slammin'", which let's just say doesn't have the degree of seriousness one would expect. These people aren't making light of real people doing real crimes, it's likely many of them didn't even know about 'bumping men' before they played P5X, but it's hard to take a guy called the Subway Slammer seriously.</p>
<p>This whole thing goes even deeper too. According to P5X writer Yusuke Nitta, the Subway Slammer is a creation of the game's previous writer, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/">kept anonymous in a now-deleted Tweet by Nitta</a>. Nitta stated the writer behind the Subway Slammer was like "the lord of the palace", and assured fans the story will get "more and more interesting from now on".</p>
<p>So the mastermind behind the Subway Slammer is out of a job, but his legacy shall remain forever seared into the hearts and minds of Persona fans. What he's doing these days remains a mystery, but if you ever find yourself catching a train, keep your head on a swivel. You never know if the Subway Slammer is lurking nearby…</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has released brand new mission content for Red Dead Online with this pack of content called Strange Tales of the West. Now, according to the trailer this is volume one of Strange Tales of the West. We get a small glimpse of what to expect in Red Dead Online’s new content and you can take a gander yourself right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pcg9NVGMxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer for Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West you will come up against zombies, alligators, a cult that worships a blood red sun, and robots that look a bit like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. Full details of each mission can be read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Tales of the Plague – There are stories of a malady spreading among the people of Armadillo, turning them into shambling undead. It’ll fall on you to retrieve several of these diseased corpses for scientific examination, if you can avoid infection and fend off attacks from a resurgent cell of nearby cultists.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of Modern Science – A nearby man of science claims he’s created artificial life that stalks the grounds of Braithwaite Manor, killing those curious or unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Bring the strange experiment to light by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Bayou – Something unholy lurks in the swamps of Lagras. Explore at your own risk, be wary of ambushes by Swamp Folk who call those wetlands home, and bring the swamp creature back for Theodore.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Wilderness – Investigate reports of a missing scientist last seen conducting strange research on a crew of murderers in Tall Trees. When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the Strange Tales of the West content in Red Dead Online you can visit any post office or your camp lockbox and picking up four telegrams from Theodore Levin. On completion of each mission you will get triple gold, RDO$, and experience points up until August 4th.</p>

<p>The release of this new content for Red Dead Online is a surprise as in 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/08/red-dead-online-support-cut-back-as-rockstar-focuses-on-gta6/">Red Dead Online support was cut back as Rockstar moved focus to GTA 6.&nbsp;</a>The sign that support is once again up and running for Red Dead Online would suggest there is a dedicated team working on Red Dead again, and it may even point to more Red Dead news in the future.</p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Game Biz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/xenoblade-dev-monolith-soft-sees-19-profit-increase/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the company recorded profits of 487 million yen during the last financial year, which is up from 409 million yen the year prior. During this period, of course, Monolith developed and released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch, meaning that every core Xenoblade title is now available on one system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82txmwko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10LJgMQyAc" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Monolith is also known for its extensive contributions to other Nintendo properties, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the increase, this isn't the best performance from Monolith Soft – far from it. According to the graph below, the company's highest performance came in 2021, during which it achieved nearly 1,200 million yen in profit.</p>

<p>Speaking of healthy numbers, reports have also been circulating to suggest that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/01/nintendo-has-now-sold-over-5-million-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-worldwide/">Nintendo has now sold 5 million Switch 2 consoles</a> since its launch. These come via updated figures on Nintendo's official investor site, but this has since been removed. It isn't completely clear whether what the figure represents, but it's likely to be projected sales that Nintendo had mistakenly posted on its site.</p>

Both Dot Esports and The Escapist have recently been sold to "a private investor" according to press releases, though it's not apparent whether both have been sold to the same investor.</p><p>Gamurs announced the sale of Dot Esports on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 13</a>, writing that the site had been sold to "a private investor." Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani wrote that "This sale allows Dot to chart its next chapter under new ownership while enabling GAMURS to double down on our mission—serving the Gen Z audience with cutting-edge content, product innovation, and world-class brand experiences.” Gamurs bought Dot Esports in <a href="https://medium.com/@GAMURS/gamurs-acquires-dot-esports-c2fb17b2fbd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2016</a>. </p><p>The company likewise announced the sale of The Escapist on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-the-escapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 24</a>, also noting a "private investor," with Chikhani writing, “This transition gives the brand a fresh opportunity to evolve independently, while we concentrate our efforts on building the next generation of digital media experiences for Gen Z audiences.”</p><p>Gamurs bought The Escapist in <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-acquires-6-new-gaming--esports-publications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022</a>, alongside five other sites, from the Enthusiast Gaming network.

Following this, several of its sites began <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updating less frequently</a>, with site PC Invasion redirecting to Prima Games. Following the layoffs in September 2024, Gamurs cited effects from Google's "Helpful Content" update and, in a memo to staff at the time seen by Aftermath, said that the company would be "refocus[ing] our energy into engaging more directly, and forming more meaningful, long-term relationships with our audiences."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-season-3-hwang-jun-ho"><h3>Squid Game Season 3’s Hwang Jun-ho Storyline Sucked</h3></a><p>I’m just happy I don’t have to see actor Wi Ha-joon putz around on that damn boat anymore

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Both companies deny the claims</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/828e1a69f9b85/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you found yourself trying to pick up a Switch 2 across the pond in recent months, then it will be old news to you that the console, and many first-party games prior to it, was not available <em>directly</em> through Amazon US. It felt like a baffling omission, but a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) might give some explanation of why this was the case — even if the two companies involved have denied it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg spoke to "a person familiar with the situation" to try to get to the bottom of why Amazon US missed out on hosting Nintendo sales of its own, and it reportedly all comes down to a sales dispute between the companies around how the online storefront handles its third-party sellers.</p>
<p>According to the report, Nintendo pulled Amazon US' official sales privileges after clocking that "unauthorised sales" were appearing on the site, undercutting Nintendo's prices. The anonymous source claimed that select sellers were bulk-buying Nintendo products in Southeast Asia, before flogging them at a reduced rate on Amazon US.</p>
<p>The storefront apparently offered to attach labels guaranteeing a product's authenticity, but Nintendo instead opted to pull all of its official sales from the site, leaving only those sold by third parties.</p>
<p>Now, as we said right from the jump, both Nintendo and Amazon US deny these claims. "There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers," a Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg. The Amazon spokesperson similarly stated that "the claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate," though there are no specifics about <em>how</em> they are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Last year, it appeared that Nintendo's so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/amazon-appears-to-be-directly-selling-first-party-switch-games-again-us">"freeze-out" of Amazon US was coming to an end</a>, as copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> began to crop up on the site with Amazon listed as the seller. But months on, very little seems to have changed. You can still find first-party Nintendo products a-plenty on regional Amazon stores like the UK, Canadian, and Japanese sites, but the lion's share of US listings still come from third-party sellers.</p>
<p>For now, it seems, you're still better off braving the likes of Best Buy, Target, GameStop and Walmart in the US if you want to ensure the Nintendo guarantee.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-ceos-pay-rises-yet-again-after-disappointing-year.1232811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay rose yet again this year, despite the fact that two of the studio's biggest releases were flops and despite overall median employee pay falling.</p>

<p>According to an EA proxy filing (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>), Wilson raked in $31 million last year, including "cash and stock awards", as Game File puts it. Wilson's pay this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">marks a major increase</a> over last year's, so clearly, EA thinks he's doing something right.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;EA Sports FC 25</i>, two of EA's tentpole releases last year, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">financial disappointments</a> for the company, although in fairness, March's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">pretty unqualified success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=S9QddC2E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=cIBknmsV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay went up this year, despite major flops like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As Game File's Stephen Totilo points out, Wilson's payrise also happened in direct contrast to median pay for EA employees, which fell last year, because of course it did. In 2023, median employee pay was $149,000 per annum, but the year after, that figure had fallen to $117,000.</p>

<p>However, as Totilo says, EA's metrics for employee pay are somewhat obfuscated, which makes their reporting a little imprecise.</p>

<p>The figure refers to "the same median employee" as the company used in previous years to report the aforementioned figure, which is slightly confusing phrasing, and the total also includes bonuses and stock grants, as Wilson's does.</p>

<p>Still, it's a little galling that in an industry where employees' jobs seem <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">constantly on the line</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">nowhere</a> does that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">appear more true</a> than at EA), Wilson can still be making money hand over fist in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=XLqtuIWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=atc5q7g_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA employees' median pay has fallen in the last couple of years.</figcaption></figure><p>Game File's chart demonstrating just how much higher Wilson's pay is than the median employee figure is pretty alarming, and it's worth looking at if you want to feel angry (and why wouldn't you?).</p>

<p>News of Wilson's payrise also comes just a few weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">the cancellation</a> of EA's&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game, as well as the shutdown of the studio making said game. One rather wonders if some of the money allocated to Wilson's bonus couldn't have gone towards saving that project and the jobs associated with it, but I guess I'm not a corporate exec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>I recently traveled to New York for another <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay">hands-on session</a> with the upcoming Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bananza. Before I was handed a controller, Nintendo vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen introduced the title remotely via the Switch 2's GameChat feature. During his statements, he confirmed one key piece of Donkey Kong Bananza information fans have been speculating on since its April 2 reveal: the development team behind the game.</p><p>As many people speculated based on the design, visual aesthetic, and UI of Donkey Kong Bananza, the same team that produced Super Mario Odyssey in 2017 is also responsible for Donkey Kong Bananza. Though Nintendo often delivers high-quality titles, Super Mario Odyssey was one of the highest-reviewed games of 2017, earning a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/super_mario_odyssey/b/switch/archive/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review.aspx" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3142df2-3537-42de-920b-29e35d4728ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical">9.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em></a><em>, </em>which has given that team a particularly strong reputation<em>. </em>However, it's been nearly eight years since the release of Super Mario Odyssey, and fans have been speculating about when we can expect a new release from this team.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing it's that team undoubtedly instills a sense of confidence from the fanbase, but it also raises the question of when we'll see another 3D Super Mario game. It's entirely possible another team is working on the next 3D Mario game, or even that the next 3D Mario game was developed in parallel with Donkey Kong Bananza. While Donkey Kong Bananza certainly plays like a Super Mario Odyssey successor, longtime fans of Nintendo's flagship franchise may have a bit longer to wait before Mario is back in action. Still, for those excited for Donkey Kong Bananza, this is undoubtedly good news for the quality ceiling of the first 3D DK platformer in more than a quarter-century.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the development team behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, revealing that the game is coming from Nintendo EPD Tokyo, the same studio and team as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Further details on who the game director or lead designers are have not been confirmed at this time, but this is an indication of just how highly Nintendo regards this game to put it in the hands of such a revered team. That DK Bananza is coming out right around the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, just over six weeks after, also makes this game hugely important as a launch window exclusive.</p>


<p>Given how tight-lipped Nintendo usually is over their development teams, and who is working on what games, this will actually only increase speculation over when we might expect to see the next Mario-led 3D platformer. Since the release of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, the only other 3D Mario action that we’ve seen was the Bowser’s Fury expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">the Switch port of Super Mario 3D World in 2021</a>. At the time, this was seen by many as being a potential glimpse of the next era of Mario platformer… but that wait could be lengthened if the whole studio is working on DK Bananza, without the workforce having been split to foster multiple game concepts.</p>
<p>Still, this greatly increases the expectations that we all have for Donkey Kong Bananza. We said, of Super Mario Odyssey in 2017, “[It] is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo play with new ideas while also paying homage to their long&nbsp;history. Cappy’s abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario’s own, and there’s a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting&nbsp;kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner.&nbsp;Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece.”</p>

<p>I’ve also been hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">an extended preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, saying “while some elements like just how chaotic and frenzied the screen can get while digging with complete abandon still feel a little unlike Nintendo, playing for longer reveals a lot more of what this team are trying to do and how the inventiveness that’s been a core part of this studio’s games for so long can really shine through.”</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip.1232772/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nintendo has a real knack for testing my attention span. I felt it in the subtask-filled Hyrule of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but, far more importantly for this preview, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> that most effectively bombarded me with distractions. Even a simple 'Walk to that giant building in New Donk City' would quickly turn into a three-hour parkour sesh to find a Moon nowhere near my assigned objective, followed by a journey down a manhole cover, through some girders and any other way I could think of that <em>wasn't</em> towards the mission icon that silently judged me from the side of the screen.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the Odyssey team has seemingly done it again — and yes, we now know for sure that this <em>is</em> Nintendo EPD (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">or "the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a>). At a recent hands-on preview, I was lucky enough to play the upcoming platformer for around three hours, and I feel like I hardly scratched the surface, which is ironic, considering this is a game all about scratching, punching, digging and kicking surfaces. Donkey Kong Bananza has the hallmarks of an all-timer, and I can't wait to dive back in and see all the <em>kongtent</em> (sorry) I missed.</p>
<p>If you've somehow avoided the marketing for this one so far, allow me to provide a brief refresher. This is DK's first 3D platformer since the controversial collectathon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and it sees Nintendo's prized primate on a journey to the centre of the planet, in hot pursuit of the banana-pinching Void Co. He's joined on this downward dig by Pauline — yep, <em>that</em> Pauline — a 13-year-old singer-turned-purple rock who assumes Diddy Kong's usual position of back companion to the great ape, and can assist with her musical talents.</p>

<p>DK's abilities are a little more destructive than singing. He can punch, rip off chunks of the environment, and climb just about any surface in front of him. Each level is almost entirely destructible, too, so you'll be relying on these moves to uncover secret collectibles, alternative paths, and challenge courses that are scattered around the layers. DK's also got some the freaky Bananza Transformations, which mutate him into a different jacked-up jungle inhabitant and grant him a sweet new ability in the process, like improved strength, speed, or flight.</p>
<p>I explored three of the game's starting levels and a later Forest sublevel in my preview, each of which presented me with a very simple challenge, outlined by a yellow exclamation mark. It might have been to follow the music in Ingot Isle, remove a giant Void Co. lock that was plugging up the water supply in the Lagoon, or head to the mine in the Canyon Layer, but immediately, my Odyssey distraction radar started tingling.</p>
<p>Sure, I <em>could</em> head to the mine, but what happens when I punch through this wall? Why is that pile of Bomb Rocks so close to that clearly bombable doorway? Within minutes, that yellow icon was pushed to the back of my mind, and I was off digging for a nearby Banandium Gem (Bananza's equivalent to Odyssey's Power Moons) or trying to leap to a faraway island that appeared temptingly <em>just</em> within reach.</p>

<p>Being a timed session, I was eventually told to stop mucking about and get back to the critical path, but every time I tried to, something else would catch my eye and I'd be back down the rabbit hole. After exploring the Lagoon for roughly one hour, I took a quick glance at the map — which neatly updates with your real-time destruction — and saw that I had ticked off but a fraction of what the layer had to offer. What's more, every time I gave a cursory glance around the room, where a group of other journalists were mining through the same level, every screen displayed a different location that I had yet to stumble across.</p>
<p>The exploration potential is quite the beefy banana, and every locale I saw was dripping with enough charm to make the journey feel worthwhile. DK is as expressive as they come (photo mode is going to be a blast) and his cutscene reactions got more than a fair share of chuckles from me.</p>
<p>But after I had finished ogling at his ever-shimmering fur coat and its transition from wet to dry, I was more than happy to sit back and soak in the visuals. The textures are dreamy, the lighting is ace, and everything is presented with such an attention to detail that it's hard to shake the feeling that Bananza was spawned from a place of absolute love for the character. Whether it's in the big-eyed, weird NPCs that looked like they've walked in off a Rare drawing board, or the side-scrolling 'Challenge Course' extras that had me moaning about mine carts and bad-mouthing blast barrels as if I was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> fresher all over again.</p>
<p>DK's iconic movement is back in full force, too. He still packs his signature roll, and the climbing, Turf Surf and Transformation-specific abilities like Ostrich Bananza's Flutter make exploring each stage a breeze. It didn't feel quite as deep as Mario's Cappy moveset, but an in-menu skill tree teased that there is an arsenal of slick skills at DK's disposal, all you have to do is unlock them.</p>

<p>That said, at no point did Bananza feel like a game for the hardcore only. The challenge is there for those who want it, and I saw DK bite the dust many-a time, but the option to follow the critical path and <em>not</em> dive into all the digging and terraforming is a perfectly valid one too. In fact, the co-op feels made for this experience. While the wonderful <em>Alex-from-Nintendo-Life-here</em> and I made a mean DK and Pauline team, the mode will be much better suited for those who want to play with a little one in tow, letting them bark out commands, pick up collectibles and attack enemies with Pauline in Mouse Mode, while you focus on the slightly more intense monkey business.</p>
<p>My biggest reservation after going hands-on with the game at the Switch 2 Experience back in April was its performance, and while I was pleased to see that things had definitely swung in the right direction in the months since, I couldn't help but notice a couple of small issues remained. The camera still has a nasty habit of getting a little sticky when smashing up walls down under, the frame rate wobbles in certain inconsequential instances like opening the map, and, on a couple of occasions, the sky itself took on an earthy hue when DK stood awkwardly on the threshold between a cliff face and a freshly-dug tunnel.</p>

<p>But not one of the issues troubled the DK-sized grin on my face. It felt like a bit of a TOTK situation, where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition — and yeah, a game where you can <em>seamlessly</em> move in any direction, at any time, no matter what stands in your way feels like it's earned the right to a little hiccup every now and then.</p>
<p>I should also clarify that we were told our game build still isn't finalised, so there's every chance that things will be that bit smoother come launch day. Fingers crossed, at least.</p>
<p>As my three-hour session came to an end and I emerged, blinking into the sunlight, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just played something special. In its top-notch visuals, silky smooth movement and wealth of distractions, Donkey Kong Bananza is showing all the signs of becoming DK's greatest outing to date. Heck, it might even end up as a Nintendo all-timer, assuming those technical mishaps can stay as inconsequential as they seem to be. Watch out, completionists, your next obsession might be right around the corner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Several moments of my two-hour hands-on preview of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> felt like I was playing the gritty 2009 action game <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em> — except this time I was actually playing as a gorilla. For example, I had to level a multistory building during a timed minigame. Just like in <em>Guerilla</em>, I targeted the load-bearing columns with Donkey Kong’s ripped arms to quickly bring it down. Reveling in the destruction made me feel equal parts satisfied and sinister, all while Donkey Kong struck a goofy pose.</p><p>Other times, I could sense a direct throughline from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and other major Nintendo franchises. The way that Donkey Kong can roll into a jump (and roll at the top of a jump) feels like maneuvering with <em>Odyssey</em>’s Cappy, while exploring the heights and depths of sublevels and experimenting with physics is reminiscent of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. But through it all, the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> game coming out on July 17th feels, above all else, like it’s breaking new ground as its own thing.</p><p><em>Bananza </em>is an open-world platforming RPG, complete with a skill tree that you can chip away at as you collect banandium gems. Finding five of them grants you one skill point. The skills range from upgrading basic moves, such as expanding the radius of the “clap” action, which automatically picks up nearby collectibles while revealing some hidden ones, to unlocking entirely new abilities. </p><p>Upgrading will happen quickly if you’re the exploring type, as there are dozens of hidden rewards in every area. New routes — not just secrets — will be exposed as you punch through materials. I get the impression that no two people will explore or fight their way through this game the exact same way.</p><p>As Donkey Kong, you can punch forward, upward, and downward, each with a different face button. You’ll rip out a chunk of the ground beneath by pressing ZR. Pressing and holding the button again will let you aim your throw, either with the right stick or with motion controls. </p><p>If you don’t feel like strategizing how you’ll destroy enemies, filling up your Bananergy meter by collecting gold will let you go into Bananza mode, which is apeshit. Donkey Kong can transform into different creatures, each with their own abilities. You can toggle between forms on the fly, allowing for some truly bewildering destruction and tactics.</p><p>Part of my demo’s focus was to explore the variety of locations in <em>Bananza</em>. Your main objective is to reach the core of the planet, and so you progress by digging deeper. I started at level one, and after being jumped around to a different part of the game, I was at level 300. Many of the sublevels that I visited were large, self-contained worlds full of collectibles and challenge areas. The fact that there are hundreds of them waiting to be explored has me excited to fully dig into the adventure.</p><p>Another focus was on Pauline, Donkey Kong’s kid sidekick, who Nintendo says is a major character in the new game. She has personal stakes in helping Donkey Kong reach the planet’s core because it’ll supposedly grant her the wish to go back home. In addition to fleshing out her backstory (she’ll have to meet Mario at <em>some </em>point in the future, since she eventually grows up and becomes mayor of New Donk City, right?), Pauline is a playable character if you enable co-op mode in the game, which can be done via the pause menu. </p><p>Player two isn’t a bystander. They have crosshairs and can shoot at terrain and enemies to aid player one. I tested this mode with a Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, moving it around to aim and firing with the ZR trigger. It felt pretty natural. As you move the cursor, it shows the type of material you’re hovering over (concrete, sand, gold, etc.), and you can set it as your ammo type by holding ZR. Alternatively, you can control Pauline’s crosshairs with a controller.</p><p>Pauline’s projectiles take the form of comic-style onomatopoeia (e.g., “HA!” or “WOW!“). There’s no explanation for this other than it’s just funny. But from a gameplay perspective, the action allows player two to play a major role in progression. For example, she can shoot gold at enemies and obstacles to create more damage on impact than with stone. It’s a smart evolution of player two’s more passive involvement in <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p><p>I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t notice some technical shortcomings with this prelaunch version of the game. During some hectic transitions, the frame rate took a noticeable dip, but gameplay was smooth for the most part, which is an achievement for a game that’s bursting with physics and particle effects. Also, when I was covering a lot of distance while flying in Bananza mode, there was a lot of texture pop-in. The game’s fast loading speeds, detailed character models, and vibrant worlds make it clear why this had to be a Switch 2 game, but the visual issues are a little disappointing to see on the new, more powerful hardware, especially for such a high-profile release.</p><p>Mario fans might bemoan the lack of a new 3D platformer, but I get the impression that <em>Bananza </em>— made by the <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>developers — is a huge game that should keep players satisfied for a while. It’s tough to shake the feeling of its joyous, yet slightly overwhelming depth, when loading a level. I’m a person who wants to see what’s hiding under every stone, and now there’s finally a game that will let me do just that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
