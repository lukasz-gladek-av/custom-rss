<p>Developer Don’t Nod has announced that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2 has been delayed by a month. The announcement came on Wednesday via the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>. </p>



<p>Tape 1, titled “Bloom”, is scheduled release on February 18th while Tape 2, “Rage”, is now set to launch on April 15 rather than March.</p>



<p>“We want to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“We feel that this extra time is necessary to ensure we deliver the experience players and fans deserve. We are confident that this delay will allow us to provide you with a richer experience and we can’t wait for you to live the full journey of Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat.”</p>



<p>Despite the delay, Don’t Nod says that they have “surprises” up their sleeves in between the release of Tape 1 and Tape 2. What those surprises are, however, wasn’t hinted at in the announcement. </p>



<p>Upon release, Tape 2 will be a free downloadable update for Lost Records.</p>



<p>Last October, Don’t Nod announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“reorganization project”</a>  in order to “safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem”. This project would would result in layoffs at the studio, though it’s unknown if that was part of the reason for the game’s delay.</p>



<p>When it does release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has shipped and BioWare is free to pour its resources into the fifth entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> series, players are naturally getting excited. But according to former executive producer Mark Darrah, it'll take some time for BioWare to really get the game development wheels turning.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE">newly released video documenting the production of Veilguard</a>. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource. It had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]," Darrah continued. "You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto [work on] Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah worked for BioWare for 23 years, so although he may not be a current employee, he does likely have a pretty good idea of the studio's inner workings. At any rate, the lack of advertising for Mass Effect 5 also suggests that the game's development is still in its infancy. It was first announced in 2020, but it's been crickets from BioWare since then.</p><p dir="ltr">"This [decision to focus on one game at a time] might be great," Darrah said of BioWare's steady, focused approach to the game's development, "Because what it means is BioWare--for really the first time ever--is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all [its] attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."</p>

In addition to revealing insights on the wave of layoffs and increased interest in PC game development, the results show a major year-over-year shift in developer opinions on generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, developers are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>much</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> more pessimistic about tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and MidJourney than they were the prior year. In 2024, 21 percent of game developers thought generative AI would have a "positive" impact on the video game industry. In 2025, that number has dropped to 13 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the number of survey respondents who think it will have a "negative" impact on the industry increased from 18 percent to 30 percent. This change comes even as more developers report using generative AI tools, with the number rising from 31 percent in 2024 to 36 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But one eye-opening slide shows who is adopting AI tools in game development—and for the most part, it's not the people programming or creating assets for games. The heaviest AI use showed up for those working in "Business &amp; Finance," at 50 percent of respondents. Next up were those in "Production &amp; Team Leadership" and "Community, Marketing, &amp; PR"&nbsp; at 40 percent of respondents each. Developers in all other departments reported less use.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why hasn't adoption reached the rank-and-file of game development yet?

You'd think there would be more alignment if you take claims about the technology at face value. After all, boosted productivity and faster asset creation aren't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/owlchemy-labs-ceo-andrew-eiche-thinks-devs-should-be-bullish-about-ai">inherently bad things</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—developers have been creating tools to solve those problems for as long as there's been a video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems developers view AI tools as going beyond supporting productivity and creativity. "I think AI generated code is currently low quality, and can give rise to subtle bugs that the person using the AI doesn't understand," one respondent told GDC. "If the models advance far enough, this concern might go away, but I'm skeptical. I think right now developers are better [off] avoiding AI code, unless it is for something small like a one time use script."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People will end up having to review generated content rather than create things themselves, which is not what we all get into the industry for," another wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A third respondent warned that the video game market could become "oversaturated" with "low effort or AI created projects, content, and games that are put out to make money," comparing it to the mobile free-to-play market, currently dominated by fast-follow games that are constantly A/B testing to maximize placement in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These attitudes run counter to other surveys about developer adoption of generative AI. Organizations like venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1869416258275533019">polled developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and reported that 73 percent of game studios using AI technology, and that about 67 percent of developers are "excited" about using AI in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's driving that gap in results? "A16z's methodology is opaque so it's hard to say for sure, but it's almost certainly a sampling issue," Omdia analyst Liam Deane explained to us. "If you ask developers to answer a survey about AI in games, the people who respond are inevitably going to be much more interested in AI than the average developer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that the Game Developer Collective survey (run by Omdia in partnership with Game Developer) has found 35 percent of game developers are reporting the use of generative AI tools, a number that runs parallel to data from the State of the Industry survey. "These two surveys have very different methodologies, so the fact that they produce such similar results is a good sign that the data is pretty accurate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever you think of the data, what matters most at the end of the day is whether the rank-and-file are comfortable using generative AI tools to make fun, successful games. So far signs say they're not quite there yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The question is—will they ever be?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer, Omdia, and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake.1089066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newegg, a reputable online retailer for electronics, gaming peripherals, and even games themselves, has <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the description</a> of their Nintendo eShop Gift Card. In the description, it now mentions games that haven't been announced yet, such as a "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster." At the moment, this information is still on their website and has caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>It is most likely just speculation on Newegg's side, as there have been hints at a new Mario Kart already, thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer, with a lot of the information surrounding it being analyzed by Nintendo fans. There are also titles mentioned, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-2025-original-switch/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was first announced at E3 in 2017 and has now been confirmed by Nintendo to be released in 2025, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated trailer</a> released <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">seven months ago</a>. Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also set to release this year. It's uncertain whether these titles will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 or whether they'll also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As we said above, it is most likely that this description from Newegg is just speculation based on Nintendo's release patterns, as well as what the fans are hoping for. Nintendo fans have been wanting specific Zelda remakes for a long time, with a lot of the audience begging for a remake or remaster of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Many other Zelda games could also be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2, such as A Link to the Past or Phantom Hourglass. However, those seem less likely.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that Nintendo will come up with a new Mario game to release for the Nintendo Switch 2, as Mario is Nintendo's mascot, and they always find ways to create new games surrounding Mario and his troupe. Whether that comes in the form of a new Mario Kart game, a Mario Party game, or even a Mario Sports game, there are plenty of options laid on the table for Nintendo.</p>
<p>With such a description hinting at the release of Nintendo's games that haven't even been announced yet, there is a likelihood that they will be contacted and asked to amend the description in the event that they are on the right track. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs, and has no issue in sending a cease and desist to someone or a company, regardless of how small they are.</p>

His family loses it and an inane argument about the iconic film ensues, eventually leading Peter to utter the enigmatic and now memed-to-death line, “It insists upon itself.” Nearly two decades later, the show’s creator, Seth McFarlane, finally explains what it means. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Since this has been trending, here’s a fun fact: ‘It insists upon itself’ was a criticism my college film history professor used to explain why he didn’t think ‘The Sound of Music’ was a great film,” McFarlane <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X this week</a></span>. “First-rate teacher, but I never quite followed that one.” The joke isn’t that Peter is all of a sudden being an erudite critic as the family prepares to drown from his latest idiotic stunt. It’s just a funny-sounding bunch of words that sounds like it should mean something but actually doesn’t. </p><p><em>Family Guy </em>superfans have been trying to decipher a deeper meaning for years, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions perennially sprouting up</a></span> on forums, subreddits, and social media. Sometimes the phrase just starts trending as users riff while passing idle moments gazing at their phones. Even now, people still maintain that Peter was on to something and they know exactly what he meant. </p><p>“This is why I did not like Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>,” one person responded. “It slaps you in the face and shouts ‘This is an epic masterpiece! Appreciate it!’ I did not. He learned and toned it down a bit for the sequels.” What? </p><p>“My interpretation of ‘it insists upon itself’ is, when you’re watching it, you get the feeling that one of the intents behind the film was, ‘This is SUPPOSED to be good,’” wrote another. “There are many ways that you can try to be good without trying to be good, namely bucking trends. Insisting upon itself means it hit all the notes a ‘good’ movie “should.’”</p><p>The episode 77 gag ends with Peter revealing he hasn’t even finished <em>The Godfather</em> and prefers 1986's <em>The Money Pit </em>starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long instead. The punchline is that movie sucks, too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It overcame Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and more to win Game of the Year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Nintendo is famous for making games of all genres and has many beloved franchises such as The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, and more, it's perhaps the platforming Mario series which is most iconic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-has-playstation-finally-found-its-mascot-character">Astro Bot clearly took much inspiration from the 3D platformers</a> such as Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey, but put its own spin on the concept and wrapped it in a celebration of PlayStation history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet paid tribute to Nintendo when accepting the Game of the Year award at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">The Game Awards 2024</a> last month, saying: "I remember I was a kid in 1989 Christmas, and I got a grey box, there was a game packed in, it was called Super Mario Bros. and it was really, really great - so we are in Japan, we are in Tokyo, they are in Kyoto, but I want to pay tribute to the company who really put like platformers and showed us innovation and quality consistently, and inspired us to actually make the game that we made... And I've managed not mention them, have you noticed? But you all know who they are."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/gettyimages-1045112180-1737564839128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie Fils-Aimé is a big fan of Astro Bot.

"I have to admit it," he said. "Astro Bot almost outdid Nintendo at its own game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo, meanwhile, hasn't released a brand new 3D platformer since Super Mario Odyssey was released in 2017. It was as beloved as any other, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">being called a "masterpiece" in IGN's 10/10 review</a>, but the seven year gap has left Nintendo fans pining for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new entry will likely come on the Nintendo Switch 2 though, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">was officially revealed earlier this month</a>. Nintendo only revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-9-every-character-track-and-vehicle-confirmed-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-game">a new Mario Kart game</a> alongside it, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">a Nintendo Direct presentation in April</a> will likely reveal much more, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-expected-between-april-and-september-2025-greedfall-publisher-says">a release date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by David Ryder/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/president-of-spider-man-ratchet-and-clank-dev-insomniac-announces-retirement-from-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ted Price, the founder and president of Marvel's Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, and Resistance developer Insomniac Games, has announced his retirement from PlayStation after 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price made the announcement on Sony's <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, while a follow-up <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post delved into his replacements. Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern will take over as co-studio heads of Insomniac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-wolverine-insomniac-mature-full-size">which is currently working on Marvel's Wolverine</a>, is currently "in one of the strongest positions" it's been in for years, Price said. "Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price said he made the decision last year because he felt "it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way" after more than 30 years leading Insomniac.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schneider began at Insomniac during the PlayStation 2 era and later became the studio's first community director. He then joined the senior leadership team and served as head of franchise strategy and studio relations, and then head of brand and leadership strategy, before moving to co-studio head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Huang joined Insomniac as chief financial officer and head of finance eight years ago and has so far shipped 12 games with Insomniac. Finally, Dezern has been part of Insomniac since 1998 and has worked as an environment artist, art director, Durham studio director, and most recently as head of creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them," the three said in a joint statement. "This aligns with our studio vision of making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ted has also laid the foundation for Insomniac as one of the industry’s all-time most successful studio leaders. Now, it’s up to us to help Insomniac thrive long into the future. Thanks to Ted’s guidance and leadership, we are ready."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/gettyimages-644833678-1737564572665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ted Price has retired from PlayStation after 30 years. Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Price alluded to this too. "There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights," he said. "Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He concluded: "I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life. Working side by side with Insomniacs for so many years has been a gift that I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support — inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won’t be slowing down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac certainly appears to be plenty busy, though so far has only announced Wolverine. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">The studio was the victim of a data breach in 2023</a>, however, which revealed a long list of upcoming projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">In our 8/10 review of its latest release</a>, IGN said: "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

There aren't any customizations to be had, but one feature it does include that seems likely to return when Blizzard introduces player housing proper is a way for players to set their Hearthstone to their new home.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time WoW players have received more personal living space. During the Warlords of Draenor expansion players had an entire Garrison to call their own, while Class Order Halls offered class-specific spaces for players of the same class to hang out in. This is, however, the first instance of players being able to acquire an apartment to call home.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a couple potential clues to how WoW might implement player housing to be gleaned here. For starters, the apartment simply exists in the game world, and players when visiting are treated to their own private "instance" of it. That seems to imply player housing won't be an entirely separate zone or a specific neighborhood where players can build custom houses, but rather the homes up for grabs will be added to existing locations in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's first player-owned apartment (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given how players are granted this apartment as a quest, it also seems likely that players will be given some form of player housing for free come Midnight, though there is certainly still room to have players be able to purchase other, more desirable properties. Players will ultimately have to wait for more information directly from Blizzard about what player housing will look like.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas in an interview with GameSpot last year said Blizzard was announcing player housing far in advance of Midnight's release in order to "begin a conversation" and "double-check" that Blizzard's plans for player housing matched the expectations of players. Announcing the feature so far ahead of the expansion itself also gives the team time to pivot if changes need to be made, he said. More information about player housing and Midnight it slated to come this summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when players can unlock their apartment, the goblin-filled Undermine(d) update doesn't have a release date just yet, but is expected to release in the next month or two.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> creator Don't Nod is delaying the second half of its upcoming narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage by a month, with Tape 2 now set to release on 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage marks the first time since 2020's Twin Mirror that Don't Nod has revisited the narrative adventure genre that put it on the map, and it follows the story of four high-school friends across two timelines. One half recounts the group's hazily nostalgic "magical summer" of 1995, while the second timeline picks up 27 years later, when the friends reunite to "confront the long-buried secret that made them promise to never speak again."
</p>
<p>
It's a tale that'll also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">split across two releases</a>, with Tape 1 ("Bloom") launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 18th February. Part 2 ("Rage") was previously scheduled to launch a month later on 18th March, but Don't Nod has now announced it's pushing Tape 2's release back an additional four weeks, to 15th April.

<p>
In a statement detailing the delay, the studio said it had made the decision in order to "allow for additional optimisation and to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience for players and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey."
</p><p>
Both parts of Lost Records were originally due to launch last year, but Don't Nod announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">shifting their release into 2025</a>, ostensibly to avoid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert said at the time.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, both halves of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - which Don't Nod says should provide a total of around 10-12 hours playtime - will be available through a single purchase. The game's usual price is £35.89/39,99€/$39.99 USD, but the studio has also now confirmed a limited-time launch discount of 10 percent.

			<p>It's been announced today by Virtuos, a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading video game developer</a>, that they have strategically acquired three studios across the globe. Virtuos has helped co-develop games like Crash: Mind over Mutant, The Outer Worlds, Dead Island 2, and Hogwarts Legacy, for example. They have now announced that they have acquired Pipeworks (USA), Abstraction (Netherlands), and Umanaia (Canada). They have all worked on some very significant games, which will be detailed down below so you can get an idea of the kind of developers they are.</p>
<p>In the acquisition, they will each have their own role to play in the bigger picture, with Virtuos wanting to become a globalized powerhouse for "sustainable, flexible game development solutions." By acquiring these studios, it now allows Virtuos to offer a broader range of services across game development and live operations across the globe, with studios in Europe, Asia and North America. Thus far, Virtuos' has a network of studios across 26 locations worldwide, with their specializations being at the forefront of the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pipeworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pipeworks</a> will now be Virtuos' lead game development studio in North America, as they have a 25-year strong legacy, with experience working on titles such as Terraria and Call of Duty. The team is extensive, with nearly 200 employees working at the company to help co-develop titles for console, PC, and mobile. They currently have multiple AAA titles in development with studios such as Xbox Game Studios, PlayStation Studios, and Warner Bros. Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://abstraction.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a> has a significant co-development expertise, as their portfolio consists of major titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Dune: Awakening, with the company elevating Virtuo Labs' engineering capabilities. Their team consists of over 90 industry veterans, with their mission being focused on founding new technology and game prototypes to benefit and enhance the game development process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.umanaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umanaia</a>, who has a focus on original IPs and uses its experience in creating major titles such as Assassin's Creed and For Honor, and will be helping to bolster the ongoing process of creating Virtuos Originals. Their team is the newest, as it was founded in 2021. For the most part, they will be utilizing their expertise in Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) as well as their successful post-launch strategies. Alongside this, they will be refreshing beloved IPs and creating new experiences with the gamer in mind. Umanaia is also the smallest team, with over 40 senior developers, and will be working hard in the Virtuos Originals initiative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are looking to get a brand new Nvidia RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at launch, it may be tougher than you expected. According to multiple rumors circulating, the release of the next-generation of graphics cards from Nvidia is gearing up to be the “worst when it comes to availability” in the company’s history.</p>



<p>One board partner, Zotac, confirmed supply issues in an <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/notice/1/18681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message online</a>. The AIC says that their card won’t be available on January 30 as expected, instead it will be coming in early February. Still, Zotac says that “due to external factors” there’s the chance the card may not come until mid-February.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-launch-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, they state that “communication issues” between Nvidia and its various AIC partners have resulted into limited supply for consumers.</p>



<p>Said gaming PC builder <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerGPU</a>, “Warning you all now. The launch of the RTX 5090 will be the worst when it comes to availability. Already being told to expect it to be that way for the first 3 months.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were revealed during CES</a> in early January. In addition to the two high-end graphics cards, Nvidia is set to release the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 sometime in February. An exact date, however, has yet to be announced by the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of the claims that launch availability for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will be the worst in the company’s history? &nbsp;Let us know in down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games-armchair-generals-shouldn%E2%80%99t-miss.1089006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the ongoing Steam festival focusing on real-time strategy games, now’s the perfect opportunity to score a few titles you could potentially spend hundreds of hours playing. There’s a fair number of discounted RTS games I have personally spent up to 1,000 hours playing, and some are just too good of deals to pass up. Here’s a look at five highly recommended games on Steam’s Real-Time Strategy Fest!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-worth-buying-on-steam-s-rts-fest">Best Games Worth Buying on Steam’s RTS Fest</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of the strategy genre, you’re in luck because there are countless releases annually, many of which shine. Despite the new releases and innovative indie studios taking a chance at refreshing the genre, a few old standbys tend to keep most players’ attention. With the current Steam Fest, now’s a good time to jump in for yourself!</p>



<h3 id="h-hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you ever watched a documentary or read a history book about WW2 and thought, “I could do it differently?” If so, then <strong>Hearts of Iron IV</strong> is your game, as it allows you to take economic, political, and military command of an entire nation, prepare for the upcoming war by building weapons and cementing alliances, and then fight in a global conflict. It’s challenging, rewarding, and expansive!</p>



<h3 id="h-stellaris">Stellaris</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like Hearts of Iron IV, but in space, with more operatic moments and interesting setpieces. I mean, look at the screenshot above as a science vessel scans a planet with a red sun in the background. <strong>Stellaris </strong>is beautiful and one of the most straightforward Paradox titles for new players. It allows you to tell a grand story of a space-faring empire, which speaks to many!</p>



<h3 id="h-warno">Warno</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If taking command of an entire nation or galactic empire isn’t quite your speed, <strong>Warno</strong> offers a more grounded approach to real-time strategy by placing you in charge of a fighting force full of tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, helicopters, and even fighter jets. You’ll conquer territory on the map, fighting small-unit skirmishes and endure large-scale bombardments alike, for a bombastic and entertaining RTS experience!</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-billions">They Are Billions</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>They Are Billions</strong> proves to be a highly challenging yet rewarding strategy game that took me by surprise. I didn’t think I’d spend hundreds of hours trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in a city-building survival and real-time strategy game, but this one kept me playing. You are the last bastion of humanity, surviving seemingly endless waves of the undead as they attempt to wipe humanity from the planet.</p>



<h3 id="h-total-war-rome-2">Total War: Rome 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are certainly newer entries in the long-running Total War franchise, I will always retain a soft spot for <strong>Rome 2</strong> as one of my favorite historical strategy games in the series. It’s expansive, grand, and memorable, allowing players to restore the glory of Rome by conquering the Gauls to the north or moving into Greece to the east. The world is your oyster, so long as you have the coin and men to take it yourself!</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite strategy game everyone should check out? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the Insider Gaming forums</a> to talk strategy!</p>

<p>Prepare yourself, strategy gaming fans! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7 has gone gold ahead of release</a>, and it’s almost upon us!</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Design and Build a Towering Ocean City</strong> – The world is dying, overtaken by the endless ocean. You are the leader of a small group of survivors stranded on a rusty boat. You find a small land area, solid enough to serve as a building foundation. And now, step by step, you build a city. This city will go up to the sky, weather many storms, and become a home for the last remnants of humanity. For your people.</li><li><strong>Master Physics-Based 3D Construction System</strong> – The game’s physics-based building mechanic challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions. While easy to grasp, this unique system introduces deeper simulation aspects and more creative freedom to the city-building sandbox, allowing you to bring numerous vertical city design ideas to life.</li><li><strong>Every Building Can Collapse</strong> – While building, you’re essentially playing Jenga with human lives at stake. Each structure can crumble, so you must provide enough support and find creative ways of using different building materials. There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it, though. For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or—save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other. If you fail, the state of the building can be reverted to before the collapse, so you can fix the mistakes and avoid tragic consequences – at least on lower difficulties!</li><li><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Bustling Colony of Survivors</strong> – Besides building and maintaining the city, you will also manage a colony of survivors. As their leader, navigate the wants and needs of several factions—Engineers, Sailors, and Workers—each with its own unique traits. For example, only Engineers can operate cranes, while Sailors have access to boat navigation, making resource gathering and logistics easier.</li><li><strong>Make Difficult Yet Necessary Decisions</strong> – Sometimes, you will have to make difficult yet necessary decisions to lead your people to prosperity. Try to feed every mouth generously, or be strict with food rationing. Establish martial law during the unrest, or show mercy and let people voice their frustrations. Go down in history as a benevolent shepherd or strong-hand tyrant—as long as the city prevails.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> New Challenges Every Time</strong> – Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events—like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more. Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

So, like I said, I feel like they really did a great job of balancing, and could they keep adding more and more characters? For sure, there’s definitely enough characters to go around.

<p>Some new footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages has leaked online ahead of the Xbox Developer Direct on January 23.</p>



<p>The footage was uploaded by YouTube Gougaru, who seemingly has recorded some footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages at a behind-the-scenes presentation. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MORE NEW DOOM:THE DARK AGES FOOTAGE HAS BEEN LEAKED!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NogvFk4gmI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><br>The gameplay footage gives a brief walkthrough of some of the locations in the game. Still, while the footage leaked before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox developer direct</a>, it’s understood that the gameplay originates from a tech demo of some kind, likely showcasing the latest series of graphics cards.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who have seen a preview of DOOM at the Xbox Developer Direct, the in-depth look will show more gameplay instead of map overviews.</p>



<p>Yesterday, DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked to be released on May 15, 2025</a> for the Xbox Series S|X, PC, and PlayStation 5. DOOM: The Dark Ages marks the game as one of Microsoft’s first “exclusives” to release day and date on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else to expect during the Xbox Developer Direct, Xbox has announced that South of Midnight and Expedition 33 will also be having in-depth showcases, while a fourth “unknown” game will also be revealed.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>The game is narratively set as a prequel to the 2016 DOOM title, which sold 2 million copies by July 2017 (before Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda, where the game released multiplatform). </p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 7, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, has arrived, bringing Diablo 3 Witch Doctor powers to the dungeon crawler. The new seasonal content features Headrotten enemies, which you will need to work with The Coven to defeat, increasing your standing with the faction. This means you'll need to partake in the revamped Tree of Whispers activities tied to the seasonal content. Completing these objectives will grant you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-battle-pass-season-7-rewards-all-cosmetics-titles-and-emotes/2900-6147/">battle pass</a> XP and loot for each chapter completed. The final chapter includes Dorian, a pet raven.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your progress on objectives in chapters you haven't reached does track, but your progress in each chapter won't be reflected until that chapter has been reached.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857"></a><figcaption>Each chapter has two more objectives than are required to complete the chapter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Witch's Debt: Increase standing with The Coven to Rank 1 by completing Whispers.</li><li dir="ltr">Trinket's from the Nest: Obtain 1 Cache from the Raven during a Headhunt by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Veteran of Ashes: Acquire 666 Aberrant Cinders during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 5 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 100 Bundled Herbs from Harvest Nodes, Cellars, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tanner's Apprentice: Collect 50 Rawhide from salvaging Armor, defeating Monsters, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 100 Iron Chunks from various sources</li><li dir="ltr">Deafening Whispers: Complete 10 Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Just a Sip: Upgrade your Potion to Tiny at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">In the Back Pocket: Discover the Armory to save and access builds</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These challenges are all fairly simple and should be completed without much effort, especially if you are skipping the campaigns with your new season character. The Armory might be one you need to go out of your way since it's a new feature, but shouldn't take much effort to complete. <strong>The Coven ranks appear throughout the Season Journey chapters and can be leveled by completing Tree of Whisper tasks, do not ignore these if you want to complete the Season Journey.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (battle pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache: Contains Consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache: Contains Crafting Materials, such as Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">In Service to the Tree: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Taste of Power: Collect 5 Witch Powers from any Altar of Witchcraft found near the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Twilight Dream: Acquire 1 Nightmare Dungeon Sigil</li><li dir="ltr">Pilgrimage of Nightmares: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Test of Mettle: Defeat 5 elite monsters</li><li dir="ltr">Prelude of Doom: Defeat 5 Harbingers during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Notarized Nuisance: Increase your Threat Level to Max by defeating monsters during the Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 3 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Event with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Capable Craftsmen: Learn 1 recipe of Rare or higher rarity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Another set of relatively easy goals here. The most likely ones to ignore are the Strongholds, just because you don't have to do those unless you really care about potential world activities there. The rest of these are fairly simple, if luck based, like the recipe of rare rarity, or are tied together, like multiple Helltide activities and Nightmare Dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, wish as Herbs and Veiled Crystals</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sacrificial Blade: INcrease your standing with The Coven to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Cleanser: Complete 5 Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Cave out the Necrosis: Defeat 5 Thrall of Rot, which can be found during Headhunts or in Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 aspects in the Code or Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Confront the Creature: Defeat the Blood Maiden summoned during Helltide with Baneful Hearts</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Event</li><li dir="ltr">Band of Killers: Defeat a World Boss while in a party</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 is where the tasks start to get a bit more involved, but the majority here are all tied to the seasonal content of The Coven and the related activities. The Blood Maiden is easier to defeat during a Helltide than you might expect, just because there are almost always other players grinding out kills as it's a good source of loot. An easy one to skip here is Band of Killers, as it requires you to have friends online at the same time as a World Boss is active, although you can try inviting nearby players while waiting for it to spawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge the Blood Maiden during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">In the Eyes of The Coven: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 8</li><li dir="ltr">Power Primordial: Upgrade 5 Witchcraft powers to Rank 10 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 1 Helltide Commander during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">Third Eye Open: Consume 5 Draught of Whispers to increase the likelihood of encountering Forgotten Altars and Fugitive Heads</li><li dir="ltr">Penitential Path: Defeat 666 Monsters in Penitent or Higher</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Nightmares: Complete 10 Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Tree: Obtain 10 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Form and Function: Upgrade 5 gear by adding Sockets at the Jewler</li><li dir="ltr">Forged in Blood: Craft 5 Blacksmith Cache at the Blacksmith after reaching Level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Ceremonial Smoke: Craft 1 Incense at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Strength in Numbers: Complete 1 Legion Event while in a party</li><li dir="ltr">Born in Torment: Defeat 10 Hellborne spawned by reaching Max Threat Level during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This set of objectives should take you up through level 60. If you haven't swapped over to Penitent difficulty at this point, you should, as the added bonus loot and XP is a big bonus and your equipment is likely powerful enough. You need to prepare for Torment 1, which is required for one task here. You could ignore it, but you will need to move to Torment 1 for the next chapter anyway. The Legion Event in a party is also skippable, but these occur more often than World Bosses, so it isn't entirely difficult.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Wound and Woe Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li><li dir="ltr">Otherworldly Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Raven Player Title</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 12 of 14 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Rite Keeper: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 15</li><li dir="ltr">A Tortured Gamble: Open 1 Tortured Gift of Mystery during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Shards of the Fiends: Collect 5 Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council 1 time in the Infernal Hordes on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Finder of Secrets: Find 1 Forgotten Altar</li><li dir="ltr">Headhunter: Collect 8 Fugitive Heads during Headhunts</li><li dir="ltr">Cultivate Fear: Collect 100 Obducite from such sources as Nightmare Dungeons or Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Lucid Nightmare: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">No Mere Mortal: Unlock a Legendary Paragon node after reaching level 60 using Paragon points</li><li dir="ltr">Precious Shards: Salvage 100 Ancestral Legendary items</li><li dir="ltr">Transfer of Power: Imprint 8 Aspects onto Gear at the Occultist</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 20 or higher in the Pit of the Artificer located in Cerrigar</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Tormented Echo of Varshan 1 time</li><li dir="ltr">Shock and Awe: Defeat Tormented Echo of Grigoire</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This chapter basically requires you to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-difficulty-options-explained-for-season-6-and-vessel-of-hatred/1100-6527180/">Torment 1</a> and max level. There is a large variety of activities here, but most only require you to run them a few times. The Obducite can be obtained from only a couple of Nightmare Dungeon runs and you need to do five anyway. The only ones you may want to hold off on are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">two bosses Varshan and Grigoire</a>, just because you may need to do the other activities to get your gear good enough to win those fights, but you will eventually want to do them for the loot regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Champion__Chapter_6_">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 11 of 13 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Unholy Coffers: Open 1 Greater Spoils of Hell chest after defeating the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Warden of the Swamp: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 20</li><li dir="ltr">Warbringer's Wealth: Craft 10 Occult Gems learned from Grimoires</li><li dir="ltr">Drink Deep from the Chalice: Upgrade 10 Witchcraft powers to Rank 20 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Glyph Expert: Improve 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 by completing The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Challenge: Defeat 666 Monsters on Torment 2 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Tormented Echo of Lord Zir</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat Tormented Echo of The Beast in the Ice</li><li dir="ltr">Horadric Smith: Masterwork 5 pieces of gear to Rank 5 at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Preeminence: Reach Paragon Level 100</li><li dir="ltr">Thorn in Hell: Defeat 666 monsters while at Max Threat Level during Helltide on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Coordinated Kill: While in a Party, defeat 25 Lair Bosses</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Depending on if you play Diablo 4 with friends or solo, the 25 Lair Bosses in a party is an easy skip. That does mean you will need to take on the two bosses listed here, but you should be in pretty good shape in terms of gear at this point, and you can leave them for last if you haven't. The most time-consuming task here is likely the 5 Paragon Glyphs at Rank 15, just because it will require quite a few runs of The Pit, even at high tiers, but that will help you get enough XP to reach Paragon level 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Champion rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Cache: Contains Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destroyer__Chapter_7_">Destroyer (Chapter 7)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Silencer: Complete 5 Whispers within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Roots Ablaze: Open 15 Exposed Roots within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Root Pulverizer: Activate 2 Legendary Ceremony Shrines within a single Roothold in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Waking Horrors: Defeat 50 Elite Monsters while in Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Triumph of the Tormented: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Bloodstained Hoard: Collect 750 Aether in a single run of the Infernal Hordes in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">With Sand to Spare: Complete Artificer's tier 75 or higher in The Pit, with more than five minutes remaining</li><li dir="ltr">Assassin's List: Defeat 5 Lair Bosses within 5 minutes in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Hell's Fury: Defeat 250 monsters before the Hellborne's arrival after increasing your Threat Level to Max in Torment 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This list is pretty tough across the board, fitting for the final chapter. As for which ones to ignore and which ones to do, there are too many tough ones here to really make that call. Most of these require Torment 4, and you not only need to complete tasks, but do so quickly and without dying. This will require your build to be near complete, Paragon boards finished, and a strong understanding of your ability rotations.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dorian pet Raven</li><li dir="ltr">The Raven Familiar Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache: Contains a Resplendent Spark and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual.</li></ul>

                <p>In 1994, Ted Price founded the company that would become Insomniac Games, the studio behind the Spyro the Dragon trilogy, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review-amazing-fantasy/1900-6416975/" data-ref-id="1900-6416975">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>. In addition to running the company, Price was the e was creative director on Spyro, Ratchet, and Resistance. Now, Price has revealed his plans to step down as Insomniac's CEO and retire from the video game industry. In his place, Insomniac has promoted three studio veterans to take the reins of the company.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the PlayStation blog</a>, Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern are the new co-studio heads of Insomniac. Schneider was Insomniac's first community director whose tenure with the company goes back to the PS2 era. Huang has only been with Insomniac for eight years, but he has also served as the company's CFO and Head of Finance in that time. Of the three, Dezern has been at Insomniac the longest--he joined in 1998--and has been the Head of Creative since 2017.</p><p>In a statement shared through Insomniac's parent company, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony</a>, Price revealed that he made the decision to step down last year.</p><p>"For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team," wrote Price. "During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades."</p><p>Price's retirement will be take place in March. As for the immediate future of Insomniac, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a> is one of at least two games it has in development currently. Dezern shared his excitement about that title, but refused to say <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-dev-refuses-to-comment-on-2025-release-date-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement/1100-6528944/" data-ref-id="1100-6528944">if Wolverine will be released</a> in 2025. Schneider also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-games-teases-potential-return-to-the-movies-under-its-new-leadership/1100-6528945/" data-ref-id="1100-6528945">the possibility of more film adaptations</a> after the 2016 movie based on Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p>
