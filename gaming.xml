            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-react-to-kendrick-lamars-super-bowl-playstation-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Football fans spent months preparing for Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs Super Bowl LIX halftime show, but no one was expecting to see the artist take another dig at Drake with a stadium-sized PlayStation Easter Egg.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the rapper‚Äôs set went off as expected. While the crowd cheered to spins on hits from records like DAMN and GNX, appearances from stars like Samuel Jackson and SZA helped take the show to new heights. Of course, there were plenty of references to Lamar‚Äôs infamous 2024 beef with Drake, too, but what audiences didn‚Äôt expect was how the Super Bowl performer chose to finally close the door on the former Degrassi star. As the lights went down, the words ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù could be seen illuminated on the side of the stadium, while the stage was revealed to feature PlayStation‚Äôs iconic cross, circle, triangle, and square symbols.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lamar‚Äôs Super Bowl halftime show was always going to be seen as a victory lap when it came to his beef with Drake, but bringing Sony into the fight to finally close that chapter in grand fashion felt especially brutal. Although it‚Äôs not quite clear why the To Pimp a Butterfly artist chose to seemingly channel PlayStation for the end of his year-long fight, music and gaming fans have taken to social media to share their appreciation for the dig nonetheless. At the very least, Lamar‚Äôs already great performance might be better on rewatch once you realize the stage is one big video game reference.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar brought out the PlayStation symbols and said "Game Over" üò≠<a href="https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G</a></p>‚Äî KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1888766562750148721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the stage for Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance has the PlayStation controller buttons üò≠üò≠üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/DnkrJGRDtI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DnkrJGRDtI</a></p>‚Äî Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1888764872353022049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Serena Williams, Samuel Jackson, PlayStation references, the GNX, the whole stadium yelling "AMINORR" ugh the dancers in red, white &amp; blue, SZA?!

Aside from its surprise spot in the Super Bowl halftime show, the gaming company found itself making headlines on Friday and Saturday morning when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025">gamers were locked out of accessing PSN for an extended period of time</a>. The unscheduled event saw fans unable to play any online titles for around a full day, resulting in one of the longest periods of downtime since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/21/one-year-later-reflecting-on-the-great-psn-outage">infamous outage of 2011</a>. PlayStation was eventually able to bring PSN back online later yesterday and has stated it will be gifting PlayStation Plus users an additional five days onto their subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Super Bowl still has time to go, and that means more trailers and commercials for some of the biggest movies and TV shows of 2025. Highlights so far include teasers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-rebirth-super-bowl-trailer-reveals-more-dinosaur-carnage-ahead-of-summer-premiere">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-super-bowl-trailer-packs-in-nostalgia-and-more-tom-cruise-stunts">Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thunderbolts-reappears-with-action-packed-super-bowl-trailer-and-a-first-look-at-sentry">Thunderbolts*</a>.

    <p>
      Bismuth explains the unreasonable luck needed for a record-setting Tyson fight at around the 56:30 mark in this 2024 video.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Summoning Salt says Tyson here gave him a "perfect pattern" during his first phase of endless uppercuts, something that happens only 1 in 1,600 bouts. And later in the fight, the game's random-number generator cooperated by adding only an extra 16 frames of delay (~0.8 in-game seconds) compared to a "perfect" run. Combined, Summoning Salt estimates that Tyson will only punch this quickly once every 7,000 to 10,000 attempts.</p>
<p>"It's over," Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2376320266">said live on Twitch</a> when the record-setting match was finished, in a surprisingly even tone that came over what sounds very much like a dropped controller. "I thought I'd be a lot more excited about this. Holy shit, dude! It's fucking over... Dude, am I dreaming right now? ... I'm sorry I'm so quiet. I'm kind of in shock right now that that just happened."</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>With his near-perfect combination of both skill and luck, Summoning Salt's new record surpasses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wvPExoOg8">his own previous world record</a> of precisely 2:00.00 on the in-game clock. That mark, set just eight months ago, was just three frames off of displaying 1:59 on the in-game timer for the first time.</p>
<p>Summoning Salt was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMOqycF2yQ">the first runner to break the 2:01 barrier on Tyson</a> in 2020, a feat he has since replicated just 15 times over tens of thousands of attempts. "There's essentially no difference between all of those [2:00.xx] fights and this one, except I got better luck from Tyson on this fight," he writes. "Finally, after nearly half a decade, the 1:59 has happened."</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBR9ypSOTGQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      Summoning Salt discusses the difficulty of beating 2:13 on Tyson in 2020, months before setting a then-record time of 2:00 himself

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Ironically, just before posting his first 2:00.xx fight in 2020, Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR9ypSOTGQ&amp;t=2440s">posted a video</a> discussing in part just how difficult it was for speedrunners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELep5djy_kU">to beat Matt Turk's 2007 record of 2:13 on Tyson</a>. "For years it was just this impossibly fast time that the top players just couldn't get close to," Summoning Salt said at the time. "Of course, other top players fought Tyson years later, but their best efforts came up short... they couldn't touch it. It stood alone."</p>
<p>Summoning Salt is now just over a second off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sgQ7BuEpIM">the tool-assisted speedrun record of 1:58.61</a>, which uses emulated gameplay to fight a theoretical "perfect" bout every time. But after spending years on what he writes "is the greatest gaming achievement I have ever accomplished," Summoning Salt seems ready to hang up his virtual boxing gloves for good.</p>
<p>"I have no plans to ever improve this time," he writes. "It will be beaten by somebody one day, likely by matching this fight and then getting better luck in phase 3. I have no interest in competing for that but am extremely proud to have gotten the first sub 2 ever on Mike Tyson."</p>

            <p>Exactly a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Walt Disney Company announced it was acquiring a $1.5bn USD stake in Epic Games</a> and launched a multi-year partnership to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>", the Fortnite x Disney collaboration event has reportedly moved into a "stable" build.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because "they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone".</p>

<p>At the time the collaboration was announced, explicit mention was made of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, with users able to "create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love".</p> <div>

<p>Team Vitality are the champions of IEM Katowice 2025, after upsetting top-ranked Team Spirit in a surprising 3-0 fashion in the grand final. Vitality claims their first big trophy since IEM Cologne 2024, and their first since signing former FaZe star Robin ‚Äúropz‚Äù Kool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-spirit-fails-to-defend-katowice-title">Spirit Fails to Defend Katowice Title</h2>



<p>Vitality came out firing, stealing away Spirit‚Äôs first map pick of Dust2. Robin ‚Äúropz‚Äù Kool had easily his best map since joining the team, notching 26 kills against only 9 deaths, and dominating on the T-side in the second half. On Nuke, it was the legend Mathieu ‚ÄúZywOo‚Äù Herbaut who stepped up, delivering 26 kills against only 6 deaths, while rarely using the AWP he was once synonymous with.</p>



<p>On Mirage, Vitality went into half-time with the lead for a third straight map. Spirit lost their sixth pistol round to kick off the second half, having failed to win a single pistol round all series. Trailing 11-4 and with their backs against the wall, Spirit finally showed some life in the second half, stringing together 7 straight rounds to tie it. Vitality finally got to 12 thanks to Shahar ‚ÄúflameZ‚Äù Shushan, and he opened the kills again in the pivotal final round of regulation to secure the map, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378917/vitality-vs-spirit-iem-katowice-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the series</a>, and the trophy.</p>



<p>For Vitality, this represents the first time that the organization has lifted the trophy in Katowice in more than half a dozen tries. The team‚Äôs leader Dan ‚ÄúapEX‚Äù Madesclaire had never won in Katowice in the tournament‚Äôs 11 year history until today. ZywOo also ties the legendary Oleksandr ‚Äús1mple‚Äù Kostyljev for most tournament MVP awards with 21.</p>



<p>Is Vitality the new favorite to lift the trophy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the next Major</a>?

			<p>It's time to officially announce the winners of the Wccftech Awards' 24. The list features the best games released last year and the most anticipated titles due this year, as voted by our staff and community through polls based on our respective category lists.</p>
<p>While 2024 wasn't quite as outstanding as 2023 when accounting for the overall game releases, there were certainly some standout launches. The best arguably arrived late in the year, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from MachineGames being the only game to snatch three prizes (the Adventure award from both staff and community and the Game of the Year award from the staff).</p>
<p>The rest of the best of 2024 stopped at two awards. This includes Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (voted the best RPG according to both staff and community), Tekken 8, Black Myth: Wukong, Frostpunk 2, Astro Bot, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Only in four cases out of thirteen categories was there a different winner between the staff and community polls, showing a great alignment between the tastes of our writers and our readers.</p>

<p>Our yearly Wccftech Awards also include the outlook for the next year, in this case, 2025. Here, the misalignment was much greater, with nine out of thirteen winners being different between staff and community polls. It's no wonder, though, as the games haven't been released yet, and these votes are based on current information only.</p>
<p>Arguably, the standout is that our staff isn't very excited about Grand Theft Auto VI as a whole, though perhaps that will change when Rockstar Games actually shares some gameplay details.</p>

		<p>The co-creator of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/back-to-the-future/">Back to the Future</a> franchise, Bob Gale, has hinted that a video game based on the films could be on the way. However, he is very vague and it doesn‚Äôt even seem like anything has been formalised just yet.</p>
<p><b>‚Äú</b>We‚Äôve got a shot at a new video game based on ‚ÄòBack to the Future.'‚Äù he told <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html">Cleveland.com</a>. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to tell you any more than that because I‚Äôm not allowed to, but this is something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen.‚Äù</p>


<p>The last Back to the Future game, created by Telltale Games, arrived in 2010 and it was re-released with additional content for PS4 and Xbox One in 2015.&nbsp; When the movies were originally in cinemas there were also tie-in games for the likes of the ZX Spectrum and Commodore Amiga, as well as a few titles for the NES and Super Famicom, but none of them were particularly good.&nbsp; The Telltale Games version had <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/back-to-the-future-the-game-episode-i-its-abo/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">fairly favourable</a> reviews and the point-and-click style adventure seemed to be the best way to adapt the movie, but that style of game has fallen out of favour and whoever is making the new title faces a big challenge.</p>
<p>2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie ‚Äì yes, you are old ‚Äì so there will be some sort of celebrations, maybe they will formally announce the game this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2025, Electronic Arts divulged the future of the Battlefield franchise alongside a reveal of ‚ÄòBattlefield Labs‚Äô. This all-new testing initiative promised to invite fans into the fold to have them trial Battlefield products long before they are released to the open market.</p>



<p>It was also when we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at Battlefield 6</a> ‚Äì or whatever it‚Äôll end up being named. It got me thinking about the games that came before, more particularly <strong>Battlefield 5, </strong>which I often consider to be the last <strong>good </strong>Battlefield game. </p>



<p>Don‚Äôt hate me.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here‚Äôs what I think Battlefield <strong>6 </strong>should take from Battlefield <strong>5</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-battlefield-6-need-to-have">What Does Battlefield 6 Need To Have?</h2>



<p>There are many features and mechanics unique to Battlefield 5 (or defined by Battlefield 5) that I feel would be right at home in Battlefield 6 ‚Äì not that the title or numbering has been confirmed, of course.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-royale">Battle Royale</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let‚Äôs get that controversial one out of the way right off the bat. I think Firestorm was a fantastic addition to Battlefield 5 but it was underappreciated and poorly utilised. It dropped in May 2019, just months after Respawn Entertainment released Apex Legends and around a year before Call of Duty Warzone hit the market.</p>



<p>It was a tough time for the competition in the battle royale space, but Firestorm had potential ‚Äì and guess who developed it? Criterion Games, in conjunction with EA‚Äôs DICE. Both of these studios are working on the next Battlefield game, and the rumours are that Battlefield 6 <strong>will feature </strong>a battle royale.</p>







<h3 id="h-destruction-mechanics">Destruction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5‚Äôs destruction mechanics were monumental, and through artillery, missiles, bombs, tanks, planes, and everything else in between, users could raze the entire map to the ground. Entire villages would fall under the weight of devastating explosions, tanks could crawl through buildings, and even now, the sound of a V2 bomb buzzing over fills me with impending dread.</p>



<p>There was a huge backstep in Battlefield 2042 that stripped almost every ounce of destruction from the game. It was a defining feature of the Battlefield franchise, and it was last done best in Battlefield 5. From what we saw in the first pre-alpha trailer for Battlefield 6, the game <strong>will feature </strong>intense destruction mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-con-struction-mechanics"><em>Con</em>struction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There‚Äôs a fantastic ability written almost into the background of Battlefield 5, and it allows players to whip out a toolbox and start building defences around their objectives. It‚Äôs a neat little feature that adds extra immersion to an already immersive title, and it allows players to get a little more strategic when defending a flag or a building.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a basic thing ‚Äì players can click or hold a button to lay down sandbags, dig trenches, reinforce windows, set up tank traps, or roll out walls of razor wire. It can turn a simple farmhouse into a well-defended objective in just a few minutes, and I believe that if expanded upon, it could be a fantastic returning feature in Battlefield 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-multi-dimensional-campaign">Multi-Dimensional Campaign</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5 was the last game in the series to have a core campaign, which was built around the typical model ‚Äì various theatres of war around the world during a major conflict. Battlefield 5‚Äôs campaign was cinematic and emotional, and it revealed some of the more ‚Äòsecret stories‚Äô of the Second World War, much like Battlefield 1 exposed subtones present in World War I. </p>



<p>When Battlefield 2042 debuted without a campaign, many millions of players believed the game was nursing a gigantic hole front and centre. It has been promised that Battlefield 6 will have a solid campaign like the one of days gone by, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>







<h3 id="h-another-realistic-theatre-of-war">Another Realistic Theatre of War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It wasn‚Äôt just the campaign that was gritty and raw ‚Äì it was the entire war itself. From map to map, players experienced the brutality and totality of the Second World War, travelling from Africa to France and from Norway to Japan. In Battlefield 2042, the lack of ‚Äòrealism‚Äô was an issue, as up until that point, Battlefield had more or less become synonymous with the realistic portrayal of war.</p>



<p>With the introduction of robot dogs, fantastical wing suits, instant zip-lines, and all manner of futuristic technology, Battlefield 2042 ‚Äì for a while ‚Äì didn‚Äôt feel like Battlefield at all. If Battlefield 6 is going to succeed, I‚Äôd like to suggest that it‚Äôll be because it‚Äôs rooted in realism, whether that be modern combat or another revisiting of an older conflict.</p>



<p>The early trailer released to showcase pre-alpha gameplay of Battlefield 6 led us to believe that it‚Äôll be set in a present-day theatre of war, which is good.</p>







<h3 id="h-squads-soldiers-and-platoons">Squads, Soldiers, and Platoons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 5 was much better for the player who <strong>loved </strong>Battlefield. It allowed them to form ‚ÄòPlatoons‚Äô, it encouraged better squad-based play and saw players fill leadership roles, and it didn‚Äôt need to rely on Specialists (all with unique abilities, like a ‚Äòhero shooter‚Äô) to fill out the ranks.</p>



<p>Many of these elements didn‚Äôt port over to Battlefield 2042, and it felt for a while like EA had stripped the community aspects from the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Wish Games Still Had Interesting Companion Apps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-games-still-had-interesting-companion-apps.1104405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I had a burst of nostalgia the other day. I was playing Dying Light to celebrate the game‚Äôs 10th anniversary and my mind flicked back to when the game was fresh on the market. One of my fondest memories of Dying Light is the game‚Äôs super helpful <strong>companion app</strong>, which allowed users to send scouts on virtual missions, which they‚Äôd claim rewards for later when they played the base game.</p>



<p>It had a few more features besides that, and it was a neat way to stay connected, still experience Dying Light‚Äôs universe on the go, and earn rewards without touching the game itself. It was discontinued a couple of years ago, but playing Dying Light got me thinking about the best companion apps for games that have long since disappeared.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-numbers">Beyond The Numbers</h2>



<p>I‚Äôm not just talking about <strong>stat trackers</strong>, by the way ‚Äì they‚Äôre a dime a dozen. Everything from League of Legends to World of Warcraft, and from EA FC to Destiny has a companion app, most of which is focused on tracking events, managing minor inventory mechanics, accessing account information, and sending messages in-game.</p>



<p>I miss when the best companion apps felt like games themselves ‚Äì miniature versions of a top-tier title that would allow you to truly stay connected long after you‚Äôd logged off.</p>



<p>Dying Light‚Äôs companion app was a perfect example of this.</p>



<p>Players could utilise the app to run missions, arrange scouts to travel to the most dangerous parts of the game‚Äôs world, and progress through a chain of missions with progressively better rewards. They‚Äôd need to make sure they were picking the right runner for the job, and the rewards they scavenged could be collected later in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light had a brilliant companion app</figcaption></figure>







<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed IV: Black Flag had a similar mechanic.</p>



<p>The companion app for Black Flag was stellar, allowing users to control a full-fledged fleet of ships, sending them around the world on a multitude of missions. It was discontinued in 2015, but while it was online, it offered another angle to experience the pirating adventures found at the heart of this monumental Assassin‚Äôs Creed title.</p>



<p>It was inherently linked to the game, too. As you played Black Flag and added ships to your fleet, you could command those ships in real time through the companion app. Then, you could log into the game later on and reap the rewards of those missions.</p>



<p>GTA 5‚Äôs ‚ÄòiFruit‚Äô app was also quite good. It featured mini-games that the player could use to train Chop, an in-game dog that belonged to Franklin Clinton, one of the game‚Äôs protagonists. It was entertaining enough, featuring three basic games and some additional features like car customisation and a stat tracker.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was discontinued in 2022, almost a decade after it surfaced alongside GTA 5. Will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> have another version, considering it‚Äôs very social media-heavy?</p>



<h2 id="h-run-of-the-mill">Run of the Mill</h2>



<p>Most games that have a companion app typically offer a no-frills experience that might feature a codex, an interactive map, or some kind of news feed mechanic. The best example of this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which features just that. The map is nice enough, but it‚Äôs the most common thing for companion apps to feature.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Function over form, that‚Äôs for sure</figcaption></figure>







<p>How about if Red Dead Online had a companion app through which you could send bandits or buddies on missions while you were offline, allowing them to gather resources and cash for you to use when you next played? I mean, RDO is another microtransaction-packed game, so it‚Äôs unlikely that would happen ‚Äì Rockstar wants you to purchase those gold bars.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, some companion apps without engaging features like this are still plenty helpful. There‚Äôs a nice <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a> companion app <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/treestn-tarkov_companion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Overwolf</a> with interactive maps, quest trackers, and guides for weapon presets and information on the latest updates. In a game that‚Äôs as complex as Tarkov, that‚Äôs a <strong>very welcome </strong>addition.</p>



<p>But imagine if you could use a companion app to ‚Äòautomatically‚Äô run ‚ÄòScav‚Äô raids, having a timer count down at the end of which you‚Äôd see the loot secured by a Scav ‚Äì if they were successful. It‚Äôd be a spin-wheel mechanic that would have a different result every time, and I could see Battlestate Games charging for ‚Äòextra Scavs‚Äô, but I think it‚Äôd be a hit.</p>



<p>Nobody likes running Scavs <strong>really</strong>, so if you confine them to a companion app, allowing players to run them while in a regular PMC raid, everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being hit with nostalgia or if there‚Äôs a genuine demand out there for better, more immersive companion apps.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs probably just me‚Ä¶</p>



<p>Let me know if there‚Äôs a particular app you enjoy using on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

She's being held in the city of Easafir, a far cry from our humble forest home. Her plea for help suggests this might be more than just a rescue mission, and her captor might have designs on a larger prize unless we can stop them.</i></p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>was a successful Kickstarter back in 2022, and this month, they're launching the next KS for the second printing of the core set, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyboards/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-second-print-and-new-expansion" rel="nofollow">new expansion</a>. In this review though, we're just looking at the core&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em> set. While this is our first foray into <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, we've covered Mighty Boards products before. One of my earliest tabletop reviews on TechRaptor was the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vengeance-review-so-any-more-subordinates-for-me-to-kill" rel="nofollow">Vengeance</a>. Along with the board game we're reviewing here, <em>Fateforge</em> also has a tabletop RPG and upcoming video game, which you can check out <a href="https://fateforge.org/en" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>is&nbsp;an app-driven narrative cooperative adventure game that can be played solo, or with up to 4 players. Each player picks a character, and the app then guides you through a series of narrative options, battles, and side quests. Mighty Boards have deliberately focused the different elements into manageable chunks, with each combat taking around an hour, including set up, and the exploration and side quest elements between 15 and 30 mins.</p>

<p>The core<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>set has 5 character options that most will recognize as fantasy archetypes. There's the Mercenary, Rogue, Forest Guard, Shaman, and Noble. Each has their own unique dice pool and style of play, along with character development along the way. The Forest Guard for example starts with 3 blue and 1 green dice, blue for ranged combat and green for intelligence. The dice themselves have different icons for movement, ranged and melee combat, misses, and also focus which can be used to activate skills and abilities.</p>

<p>During each combat turn, all players roll 4 dice which will indicate what actions they can do during their turn. Certain abilities will let you reroll misses and convert some icons into others. The shaman's power chant for example can turn a miss into a focus, which they can then use to heal other party members. As the characters develop, you'll be able to change your dice pool and add more abilities to give you better options and more powerful attacks.</p>

<p>The <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>app takes players through the story, detailing all the narrative elements and offering choices as players progress. It also details how combat missions are set up, and regulates the actions of the enemies, which are controlled by AI scripts on cards. I found the AI controls for the enemies to be extremely well handled. Most maps are close enough that you could feel the pressure of the enemies, and although they could be worked around (some enemies don't move, and will only attack if you're in their or an adjacent zone), it felt in keeping with the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt that the game did suffer from what all app-driven games suffer from, and that's the feeling that sometimes it could all be done on the app, or none of it, and the transition between the two, especially in combat can feel a little jarring. I forgot to progress the app during combat a few times, following the combat phase stages until the reaction phase of the enemies, which is detailed by the app. It does progress the narrative well, and the way it remembers and changes the narrative based on your actions is difficult to do with pure physical components.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Mighty Boards have deliberately managed the timing of combats and narrative sessions in&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, and the pacing feels great. In a full gaming night, you can get through several combats and their linked events, or if you're only able to meet for an hour or so, you can move slowly through the campaign that way and it won't feel like your campaign is stagnating if you can't meet for longer sessions.</p>

<p>The game is challenging as well, and your health doesn't fully regenerate between combats, making you manage it between combats, or deal with the scenarios differently. If you're low on health, you will have to choose to miss objectives, just punch straight through to the exit, or be a lot more tactical in avoiding combat and enemies. My Rogue and Forest Guard combination sees the Rogue rushing forward, stunning and removing enemies, and the Forest Guard trying to take out the rest at range. They had no healing between them, so if the Rogue's stealth failed and she took a beating, it meant us trying to avoid combat for the rest of that scenario, and possibly the next.</p>

<p>The story itself is a lot more engaging than I thought it would be, and the city itself, the characters you meet, and the choices you make feel very impactful, and is probably as close as you could get to a full roleplaying game without a Games Master.</p>

<p>I was surprised by&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan. </em>I thought the dice combat was going to be annoying (I usually prefer to just choose my actions), but the different skills and abilities as you level up make it a unique and challenging puzzle, and although the enemies have set AI controls that can be worked around, it feels like part of the game. The setup and play time is fast and the story is extremely rewarding, and each of the different character options feels unique, and their development, along with that of the core narrative is extremely engaging.</p>

<p>The app is very prevalent, so if app-driven content isn't your thing, you can't avoid it here, but it does add to the game well, and although it does feel like the entire thing could be done digitally, without the need for physical components, having that physical element, especially with 2 to 4 players, helps keep it grounded in the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/09/sony-promise-5-days-extra-ps-plus-as-compensation-for-psn-outage/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the remarkable 24 hours downtime for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PlayStation Network</a> on Saturday 8th February, Sony as issued an apology and announced compensation for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> members ‚Äì everyone will have five days added to their current subscriptions.</p>
<p>Writing on a certain social media hellhole, Sony writes:</p>


<p>Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience. All PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional 5 days of service.</p>
<p>At this time Sony hasn‚Äôt actually issued an explanation for what caused the downtime. Naturally, given historical service outages, there‚Äôs speculation over whether this was an attempted hack, as in 2011, a brazen DDoS attack, as in December 2014, or something more mundane, like a backend update gone wrong.</p>
<p>5 days of extra PS Plus is decent recompense for subscribers, though it‚Äôs not exactly perfect. For one thing, it means that those playing free-to-play titles that don‚Äôt require PS Plus were also affected and seemingly won‚Äôt get any kind of love here.</p>

<p>Companies who were holding events and betas this weekend are also trying to adjust and make up for the lost time. Capcom is considering having an extra 24 hours for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-2-is-coming-in-february/">Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</a>, and we‚Äôll see if Activision does similar for the current double XP event.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also a bit of a knock on effect for frugal gamers that look to take advantage of sale periods, particularly around Black Friday. Letting your subscription lapse at the right time leaves you then able to grab another year on discount with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù customer promotion, which isn‚Äôt typically available to existing subscribers. 5 extra days being automatically added could knock a whole swathe of players out of the window to take advantage of these offers.</p>
<p>Anyway. It‚Äôs Sunday and PSN is live and kicking once again. Happy online gaming, everyone!</p>

			<p>All PlayStation Plus members will receive compensation for the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/">PlayStation Network outage</a>, Sony confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on X, it has been confirmed that network services have fully recovered from an unspecified operational issue, and that all PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional five days of service, which is definitely decent compensation, considering the outage lasted for a little over 20 hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience. All PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional 5 days of service.</p>
<p>‚Äî Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This operational issue that caused the PlayStation Network outage on Friday couldn't have come at a worse time, as it prevented PS5 owners from trying out the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta for almost an entire day, which will unlikely get extended to compensate for the outage, at least for this phase, unless CAPCOM decides to surprise players in the next few hours. [<strong>Update:</strong> CAPCOM is <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888530732232134839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1888530732232134839%7Ctwgr%5E2ad6706d083cd24cfa75efc7dd9bccba5df4fcf2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fmonster-hunter-wilds-beta-set-to-get-additional-day-following-global-psn-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering</a> running the open beta for an additional 24 hours to compensate for the outage at a later date.] Still, at the very least, the outage did not last over 20 days as it did in 2011 when PSN suffered a hacking attack where the personal information of users was stolen. Back then, users were compensated for the long outage with a free one-month subscription, a one-month PlayStation Plus membership extension, and two free games between five PS3 and four PSP games, which included some solid games like the first entry in the inFAMOUS series.</p>

            <p>Following the lengthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">PSN outage this weekend</a>, Capcom has assured PS5 players that it will hold an additional Monster Hunters Wild open beta test "at a future date".</p>
<p>With only two open beta tests planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release at the end of this month, PS5 players have not only missed out on playtime over the weekend, but also participation bonuses.

            <title><![CDATA[Civilization 7 is Coming to VR for the First Time Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-vr-first-time/</link>

<p>In just a couple of days, players worldwide will get their hands on the long-awaited release of Civilization 7 (stylised as Civilization VII). It has been almost a decade since the last major release in the Civ series, and fans are understandably very excited for the chance to drive empires forward once again.</p>



<p>Recently, an entirely new perspective on the Civilization series was revealed ‚Äì a <strong>VR version </strong>of Civ 7. It‚Äôs being developed by PlaySide Studios and 2K in collaboration with Firaxis and it‚Äôs coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S in the spring.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-truly-immersive">Truly Immersive</h2>



<p>Firaxis, PlaySide, and 2K worked to release a new trailer for Civilization 7, this one surprisingly showcasing a never-before-seen VR version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The world of VR has gone from strength to strength of late. The technology is sharpening, price points are dropping slightly, and the library of games and apps available on the best headsets is forever expanding. It‚Äôs still a tentative area for some, but some developers are investing much more in the technology, which is great for those who love the immersion.</p>



<p>This is the first time in history that a Civilization game has been available on VR platforms, and it‚Äôs coming <strong>exclusively </strong>to Meta Quest 3 and 3S ‚Äì which isn‚Äôt an unheard of thing these days. These headsets dominate the market, and as a Quest 3 owner, I can say that they‚Äôre generally the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>The trailer shows exactly how this‚Äôll work, with a unique UI and configuration created solely for VR users to enjoy the relatively complex experience that Civilization 7 promises to offer. Given how long the average game of Civ 7 lasts, it could be pretty exhausting and you might need an external battery on your headset, but those are choices for you to make.</p>



<p>Do you think you‚Äôll pick up Civilization 7 on Meta Quest? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has given an actual reason for the PlayStation Network (PSN) outage that brought the service down for roughly 20 hours on Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>In a post late Saturday night on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company blamed the outage on an ‚Äúoperational issue‚Äù. Specifics on the issue weren‚Äôt given nor was anything said about preventing another issue. However, PlayStation  did, once again, apologize for what happened.</p>



<p>‚ÄúNetwork services have fully recovered from an operational issue,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience.‚Äù</p>

<p>As a make good for nearly a full day of service being lost, PlayStation is giving all PlayStation Plus members five extra days. The extension will automatically be added to all plans.</p>



<p>The PSN <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally went down</a> on Friday, February 7 around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store. It started to come back around 3:40PM ET on Saturday, February 8.</p>



<p>As the service was offline, the company didn‚Äôt provide any updates to players aside from an acknowledgement of PSN being offline hours after it went down. The next update came to state that service was restored. </p>



<p>What do you think about the reason PlayStation gave for the PSN outage? What about receiving five days of PlayStation Plus for the troubles?

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week brings with it a fresh batch of Games Workshop products up for pre-order, and this week we're taking a quick sneak peek at a few important new releases for&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>. Games Workshop provided me with preview copies of two new Death Korps of Krieg units, as well as a PDF of the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K Crusade: Nachmund Gauntlet</em>, which brings campaign play back into the 41st millenium! Read on for my first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Crusade - Nachmund Gauntlet</h2>

<p>Enclosed in this massive tome is everything you need to start running your own&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>campaign with your gaming group, compatible with the latest edition of the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=rrjN1Ntn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=yONWzMBc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Step into war on the bloody streets of Sangua Terra!</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet - Storytelling At Its Finest</h3>

<p>This massive book, which clocks in at around 120 pages, dives deep into the story so far - we learn of the warlords seeking to lay claim to the world of Sangua Terra, one of the fortified bastions against Chaos in the famed Nachmund Gauntlet.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the lore of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>, and want to know the latest in the story the underpins the events of the game as a whole, this is a treasure trove of fantastic storytelling. One of the aspects I most love about all the Codexes and rulebooks that come out for all Games Workshop products is the level of storytelling on display. This isn't simple "the baddies are moving closer to their goal" writing, we dive deep into the various factions at play, their machinations, and more.</p>

<h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Build Your Forces, See Them Through</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;many campaign rules for this game, it's hard to cover it all in a preview. So I'll keep it brief for the sake of discovery. In this Crusade book, you'll find rules to help guide a campaign over a series of missions, and there's a truly robust ruleset designed to help you play through it all.</p>

<p>You'll order all players into the campaign into alliances (ideally based on the army they're fielding) split between Guardians who seek to protect Sangua Terra, Despoilers who wish to conquer the world, and Marauders who seek to use the turmoil on Sangua Terra to their own benefit.</p>

<p>There are also a whole suite of Crusade rules specific to this Sangua Terran war, including how to use Crusade Badges, Battle Traits, Crusade Relics, and rules on using Tactical Reserves, recording your missions, blessings, agendas, and so much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=JwMd1Xxb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=ur_LOfq3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from Games Workshop showcasing how the turmoil of the Crusade can look on your battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Missions</h3>

<p>As for the missions included in this book, you'll find fifteen distinct missions that see forces doing everything from securing drop sites to acting as heralds for larger incoming forces. One of my favorites is the Saboteurs mission, which sees the Attacker-designated player trying to get deep into Defender territory to use a special action to sabotage important points on the map.</p>

<p>All throughout, these missions seem to me to balance a bit of novel and thematic gameplay with well-balanced challenges. There's nothing in here that feels so story driven that you're at a disadvantage for being on the wrong side of the narrative. This is a seriously robust Crusade book, and if you've got a regular playgroup or a local shop running this campaign, it's well-worth checking out.</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg New Releases</h2>

<p>Many, many new releases are coming this week for pre-order for the Death Korps of Krieg army. We recently covered the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box" rel="nofollow">brand new Krieg Army Box</a> that just released for the forces, and many of the units that were bundled in the box are now available for pre-order separately. I'm now getting my first look at two additional units coming that weren't included in the box set: The Krieg Heavy Weapons Squad, and the Krieg Command Squad.</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Heavy Weapons Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=49PN03cC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=NhpYXT7D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Heavy Weapons Squad unleashes serious firepower.</figcaption></figure><p>The Heavy Weapons Squad is designed to be built and suited to your needs! Each unit contains three Heavy Weapons Gunner models and one Fire Coordinator model, and each model has both a laspistol and close combat weapon for when the battle gets a little too close to them.</p>

<p>But we're not here to talk about laspistols! The standard construction for these models is to have each Heavy Weapons Gunner equipped with a lascannon, which fires a single shot at a staggering 12 Strength, dealing D6+1 damage per hit. But you can swap these out as you see fit to include a Twin Krieg heavy stubber which hits hard with three Attacks per model and has Rapid Fire 3.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also build these models with a Krieg heavy flamer, which has the "ignores cover" and "torrent" keywords and deals d6 attacks at 2 damage each.</p>

<p>All in all, this unit is a great option if you want some heavy fire but don't like fielding tanks!</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Command Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=Ie3Xpszc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=AnF8d1_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Krieg Command Squad is great for getting those crucial orders issued to your army.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's take a look at the new Krieg Command Squad! This is the Krieg army knife of the army, with so many different weapon loadouts for the various members of the Squad. Where it really all comes together is in the Wargear abilities for the various bits, bobs, and gadgets attached to your models.</p>

<p>Let's chat about those abilities quickly: there's the Master Vox - which allows the Officer in this unit to issue orders up to 24" away, the Alchemyk Counteragents - which gives the unit the "Feel No Pain 6+" ability against mortal wounds, the Regimental Standard - which adds 1 to the Objective Control score of models in the unit (that's for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;model), and the Servo-scribes - which, once per battle, lets the Officer issue two Orders at once (and is marked with a very cool Servo-scribes model).</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the most out of issuing orders to your Krieg army, this unit is not only pretty tough, and full of great weaponry, but they'll help you get those orders out efficiently.</p>

<p>That covers everything we got a chance to check out early with this week's preorder previews! Let us know what you think about these new releases in the comments!</p>
