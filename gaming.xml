<p>The film's listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> (FTIA) website has seen a status update this week, with the former "Pre-Production" stamp changing to the much more promising "In Production" — that's what we like to see.</p>
<p>The main filming location is listed on the site as Wellington, New Zealand, a common spot for bringing fantasy lands to the big screen, as previously used for <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy, <strong>Avatar</strong> and <strong>King Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>The FTIA provides the following project summary for the upcoming movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce—an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we've known for a while that the Zelda movie would be shooting in New Zealand in November 2025, but it's exciting to see that production status change!</p>
<p>The film is set to release on 7th May 2027 — assuming there are no more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">delays</a>. The only casting that we know of so far is <strong>Renegade Nell</strong>'s Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and <strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong>'s Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, but we'd be surprised if we don't get a few more face reveals in the next year or so.</p>

                                        <p>Every decision counts in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. From the smallest lie in a conversation to the biggest choice between warring factions, every move you make ripples through the Arcadia colony--shifting alliances, rewriting quests, and redefining what kind of commander you are. Obsidian Entertainment’s latest sci-fi RPG doesn’t just tell you your choices matter--it makes you feel it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A colony on the brink</span></h2><p>Set in the new frontier of Arcadia, the sequel drops you into a world tearing itself apart. The Protectorate’s so-called benevolent rule is being challenged by rebels of a rising religious order, while opportunistic corporations close in to claim what’s left. As devastating rifts spread across the system, you’re tasked with uncovering their source--but who you trust (and who you betray) could decide whether Arcadia survives or collapses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Choices that echo through every mission</span></h2><p>In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, no two playthroughs will ever look the same. Dialogue choices can unlock alternate solutions, close off others, or completely change how characters respond to you later. Promise loyalty to a faction, and doors will open--but betray them, and those doors might slam shut for good. Even seemingly small moments, like a sarcastic quip or a quick act of mercy, can come back around hours later in surprising ways.</p><p>Obsidian’s trademark cause-and-effect storytelling is in full force here. You’re constantly juggling competing motivations--moral, political, and personal--as the colony reacts to your growing reputation. Maybe you’re a peacemaker trying to broker stability, or maybe you lean into chaos, playing every side until only yours is left standing. The brilliance lies in how the game never tells you which is right--it just lets you live with the fallout.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Relationships that remember</span></h2><p>Your companions are more than just party members--they’re witnesses to your leadership. They’ll react to your choices, question your motives, and sometimes even walk away if your ideals clash too deeply. The relationships you build (or burn) with them can alter entire questlines, shaping not only their stories but your own. Whether you lead with empathy, ambition, or pure self-interest, Arcadia, and the people in it, will remember.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A galaxy that bends to you</span></h2><p>Across its sprawling environments--from sun-scorched deserts to neon-drenched cities--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> keeps the focus on agency. Exploration feeds directly into consequence: the terminals you hack, secrets you uncover, and decisions you make along the way all inform how the colony evolves. There’s no “perfect” path through Arcadia, only the one you carve for yourself.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is available now as a day one release with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to shape their own version of Arcadia’s story. Whether you want to lead with diplomacy, deception, or pure firepower, Game Pass makes it easy to dive in on launch day and start rewriting the galaxy--one decision at a time.</p><p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/the-outer-worlds-2" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/the-outer-worlds-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox</a></p>

                                        <p>For RPG fans, there’s nothing quite like the moment a new world opens up before you--when the menu fades, the music swells, and you realise you can go anywhere. Role-playing games have always offered that rare kind of escapism: the chance to step into a different life, shape your own story, and lose yourself in a universe that feels alive.</p><p>With <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, Obsidian Entertainment captures that feeling again--the thrill of exploration, the satisfaction of choice, and the joy of seeing a world shift around your actions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every corner of Arcadia tells a story worth discovering.</span></h2><p>Arcadia, the colony at the heart of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, feels like a place built for wandering. Every outpost, settlement, and alien landscape tells its own story. The conversations you overhear, the missions you stumble into, even the way the sky shifts above you--it all makes the world feel lived-in. There’s a sense of texture to everything, like the game wants you to slow down and take it in rather than rush to the next objective.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every build tells a different story about the kind of player you are</span></h2><p>Part of what makes RPGs so magnetic is the chance to decide who you’ll become. In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you build your commander from the ground up--their look, their skills, their attitude. Some players might choose a smooth-talking diplomat who navigates danger through dialogue, while others prefer a stealthy tactician or a fearless brawler. However you play, your approach changes how the story unfolds and how the world responds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The story evolves around the paths you choose to take</span></h2><p>Every decision in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> feels like it matters. The alliances you form, the people you help, and the promises you break all ripple through Arcadia. Sometimes the effects are immediate. Other times they echo hours later, catching you off guard in ways that feel human. It’s that balance of consequence and curiosity that makes RPGs so rewarding -- the sense that your version of the story truly belongs to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The Outer Worlds 2 captures what makes immersion feel so special</span></h2><p>At their best, RPGs give you space to disappear for a while--not to avoid reality, but to explore new ones. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> understands that pull completely. It builds a world worth escaping into, filled with choices that challenge you, characters that surprise you, and moments that stick long after you’ve logged off.</p><p>For anyone who loves rich storytelling and total creative freedom, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a must-play. It’s available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to Arcadia and everything it holds. Whether you’re an Obsidian loyalist or new to the series, this is the kind of game that reminds you why RPGs have always been the most rewarding way to play--because they give you the space to explore, to imagine, and to make every world your own.</p><p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/the-outer-worlds-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox</a></p>

From Obsidian Entertainment, the masters of sharp-tongued sci-fi and branching RPGs, this sequel catapults players into a brand-new colony--Arcadia--for a story filled with danger, discovery, and difficult choices that can change the fate of an entire galaxy.</p><p>Set in the far reaches of space, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> casts you as a daring (and, as the game cheekily reminds you, “most likely good-looking”) Earth Directorate agent tasked with investigating mysterious rifts tearing through reality. These fractures threaten humanity itself, and your mission to uncover their source leads you straight into Arcadia--a colony at war with itself. Here, the Protectorate’s iron-fisted rule is being challenged by rebellious religious orders and encroaching corporate powers. Every side claims to be saving the system, so it’s up to you to decide who to believe… or who to betray.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2>A new world, shaped by your choices</h2><p>At its heart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is everything fans loved about the original--moral grey areas, biting humour, and choices that actually matter--but turned up several notches. Every skill point, dialogue option, and faction alliance can shift how your story unfolds. Whether you’re a smooth-talking diplomat, a chaos-loving gunslinger, or someone who just likes to press every sarcastic response possible, Arcadia reacts in kind.</p><p>This time around, Obsidian gives you even more freedom to define your character. You can build your commander from the ground up--complete with unique strengths, flaws, and backstory traits that influence how others see you (and how you see yourself). Your abilities, decisions, and even your mistakes ripple out into the world, altering relationships and rewriting your path as the story progresses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A crew worth crossing galaxies for</span></h2><p>No space-faring hero travels alone, and the companions you recruit along the way bring their own secrets, loyalties, and motivations to the mix.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired between thirty and forty GTA developers </a>across its offices in Canada and the United Kingdom, triggering accusations by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) that the game studio sought to prevent their attempt to unionize. The IWGB claimed that all those developers were working to that end, and vowed to defend their rights through 'every legal claim possible'.</p>



<p>Initially, Rockstar Games only stated that they had been fired due to a rather generic 'gross misconduct'. Now, though, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received a more detailed statement from a company spokesperson</a>. The GTA and Red Dead Redemption developer claims these employees were 'found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum', in violation of Rockstar's policies. As such, the terminations had nothing to do with union busting, according to the spokesperson.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the IWGB isn't much convinced. Its president, Alex Marshall, replied with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Rockstar is afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</em></p>



<p>Currently, the IWGB <a href="https://x.com/IWGBunion/status/1986081909278212100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is protesting</a> outside Take-Two House, 30 Cleveland Street, London, in solidarity with the fired workers. </p>



<p>There are indeed multiple public forums dedicated to the Grand Theft Auto series, chiefly GTAForums, which is often a source of leaks. However, it doesn't seem like any significant leak was shared there or elsewhere recently. Still, Rockstar Games has taken a deadly serious approach to security following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alleged-gta-6-videos-schreier-its-likely-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big Grand Theft Auto VI leak</a> that occurred on September 18, 2022. A couple of months later, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-reaffirms-that-gta-6-leak-wont-influence-development-or-anything-of-the-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the leak would not affect the development of the game, but Rockstar (and Take-Two) aren't taking any chances now that the finish line is finally in sight.</p>



<p>Originally targeting a Fall 2025 launch window, the most hyped game of all time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now set to launch on May 26, 2026</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X. Of course, a delay could still happen, as shown by Rockstar's track record. Hopefully that won't be needed, especially as it would further delay the PC version (though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CEO of Corsair Gaming</a>, PC gamers might not have to wait as long as with previous franchise entries).</p>

            <p>Oi, gaffer! I know you're busy trying to work out the exact moment at which we should park the bus and start unleashing the long throw-ins, but you'll probably want to know about the chunky patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> devs Sports Interactive have released into Steam beta. It's aimed at fixing a lit of the initial issues which've been causing ire since release earlier this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update delivers over three hundred fixes and quality of life improvements," the studio wrote in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3551340/view/615431029997437073?l=english">Steam announcement</a> of this beta patch. "Key highlights include new preferences for adjusting attribute colours, a preference to turn off/alter the speed of UI transitions, as well as a 1.5x Match Speed option, all introduced in response to your early beta feedback."</p>
<p>Beyond those, some tweaks which've caught my eye include "substantial crash and stability fixes", "further fixes to matches Freezing at start of the second half in single-player career", and "manually scouting a player will now correctly delegate an appropriate scout". Alright, if I'm being honest, those ones just strike me as useful, the following really caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where white match ball would be used in snowy weather</li>
<li>Fixed issue forcing user to holiday past end of season team meeting</li>
<li>Overall start/until dates within Club &gt; Finances &gt; Debts &amp; Loans will no longer display 01/01/1900</li>
<li>Fixed issue where player would reject the own asking price that they themselves had set</li>
<li>Manager attire choices will now save correctly</li>
<li>'Exit Talks' button now functions correctly within Contract Negotiations</li>
</ul>
<p>This barrage of tweaks is just the start, with Sports Interactive revealing: "The next update for the beta track is already underway (details to follow), and it’s set to introduce a legacy preference to advance through messages with the spacebar, which we’ve been working on since the initial beta feedback came in."</p><p>So far Football Manager 26's critic reception <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/football-manager-26/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">looks pretty mixed</a>, while user reviews have skewed much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/#app_reviews_hash">more negatively</a>. We've got our own review in the works, so make sure to look out for that if you're taking the wait-and-see approach before donning your monogrammed tracksuit.</p>
<p>To give this beta patch a go, you'll need to head to the manage button on the game's listing in your Steam library, then properties, then betas, and select public beta from the private betas drop-down menu. It's the standard path you'll be familiar with if you're a veteran of Steam betas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few years ago, NetEase Games helped fund several game development studios based in Western countries and Japan. Over the last year, though, many of those were abruptly shut down in the middle of developing those projects that NetEase had expressed interest in the first place.</p>



<p>This includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a> (spearheaded by a Mass Effect writer, who was working with his team on a sci-fi action/adventure game), <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jar of Sparks</a> (founded by former Halo Infinite developers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouka Studios</a> (the only one to actually release their game, Visions of Mana, before being shut down), and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>. The former studio has received an unexpected second wind thanks to a few veterans and directors who decided to invest in retaining the name; the latter now has an expiration date of November 17, although founder Greg Street is still trying to secure funding until the last possible moment. </p>



<p>NetEase must have mandated that November 17 date, as it's the same expiration date that another developer, the Montréal-based Bad Brain Game Studios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicated a few hours ago in a LinkedIn post</a>. Sean Crooks, Studio Head and former Ubisoft developer on Watch Dogs games, is still trying to shop around the game they were working on, The Midnight Riders:</p>



<p><em>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</em></p>



<p>To help showcase their work, they shared a sizzle reel, which makes it look a lot like a proper Stranger Things game. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-brain-game-studios-qa-building-an-open-world-spielberg-ft-king-coming-of-age-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed Sean Crooks in June 2023</a>, he shared his vision for a 'Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King in an open world with a coming-of-age story'. The game was also clearly set in the 1980s.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are other studios whose fate is currently uncertain, such as Jackalyptic Games, which is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a Warhammer-based massively multiplayer online game</a>. Unfortunately, there has been no official update, only rumors that Jack Emmert and his team are also looking for another publisher. Even a high-profile hire such as Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has only been given enough resources to finish his game, and according to reports, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't even want to pay for its marketing anymore</a>.</p>

                <p>This year, Naughty Dog is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a studio, which had humble beginnings compared to its current status as one of Sony's most important first-party developers. Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin formed the company when they were still teenagers, and the foundation they built continues long after they left Naughty Dog. Now, Naughty Dog has shared a retrospective video for its 40th anniversary that revisits some of its greatest hits while looking ahead to the future.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_EIOxtOVY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rT_EIOxtOVY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gavin and Rubin discuss the company's earliest origins, which date back to their time in school. The video doesn't focus much on the company's largely forgotten early titles, including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior. Instead, it marks the debut of the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter franchises as a turning point for Naughty Dog.</p><p>From there, the retrospective moves on to the company's cinematic action era that began in 2007 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune/" data-ref-id="5000-26749">Uncharted</a>, and continues through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part 2</a> and the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. A few brief scenes from Intergalactic was shown as studio manager and head of operations Alison Mori said, "I know our studio will continue to create amazing story-driven, character-based games that touch upon the human experience."</p><p>"I hope the future holds more of what Naughty Dog has always done," added Rubin. "Being at the forefront of making entertainment that is of the highest possible quality, telling the stories it wants to tell, with depth and meaning."</p><p>Earlier this year, Gavin shared his opinion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-co-founder-says-one-simple-change-made-crash-bandicoot-remakes-worse/1100-6533250/" data-ref-id="1100-6533250">the change made to the Crash Bandicoot remakes</a> that made the games worse. Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-reveals-why-he-decided-to-leave-the-last-of-us-tv-show/1100-6534673/" data-ref-id="1100-6534673">stepped away from The Last of Us TV show</a> to focus on his work at the studio. Druckmann has since teased that Intergalactic has "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">the deepest gameplay we've ever done</a>." However, the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Arcades may be largely a thing of the past, but some of the bigger cabinets of the '90s offered players co-op battles and head-to-head match-ups that consoles of that era couldn't match. Now, one of those games, Namco's Tokyo Wars, is finally getting its first console port after debuting in 1996.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55XrAWvTksk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/55XrAWvTksk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tokyo Wars is coming to modern consoles as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives and Arcade Archives 2 collections. The game lets players control a tank or a team of tanks as they face off against a rival team in Tokyo's downtown district or the city's bayside dock. In the arcades, up to eight players could take part in Tokyo Wars' head-to-head battles if four two-player cabinets were linked together. The cabinets also featured an air-powered recoil that simulated the sensation of tank fire.</p><p>It's important to note that the Arcade Archives version for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch don't have as many options as the Arcade Archives 2 version on other consoles. In the former, players will get the original arcade game, a high-score mode, and a caravan mode that gives players 10-minutes to come out on top. Each of those modes will support online rankings.</p><p>However, only the Arcade Archive 2 versions on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Switch 2 will offer split-screen multiplayer, a time attack mode, and VRR support. Tokyo Wars' Arcade Archive 1 and 2 versions are both available now on their consoles' respective digital storefronts.</p><p>If you're looking for a quieter arcade experience, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/golden-tee-arcade-classics/" data-ref-id="5000-682677">Golden Tee Arcade Classics collection</a> was released earlier this year. But if you want to play the action-packed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> arcade game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-its-own-arcade-game/1100-6530277/" data-ref-id="1100-6530277">Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars</a>, you'll have to find a Dave &amp; Buster's or another modern arcade.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bots keep players from waiting "possibly forever" to get into games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has taken to social media to clear the air about how Battlefield Studios uses bots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer to keep players engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s latest entry in the Battlefield series notoriously uses bots to populate standard matches that struggle to fill teams with real-world players. It’s led to some confusion in the community, as fans attempt to grasp when, how, and why BF Studios has been implementing them in online matches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986035968592204179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X/Twitter</a> to shed light on bots, explicitly calling attention to “confusion” in the player base that he hopes to clear up. The thread of posts comes with an explanation for why some may see more bots than others, as well as the promise that EA and BF Studios will continue listening to feedback from Battlefield 6 multiplayer fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have noticed bots in standard multiplayer playlist options, especially for game modes with large lobbies like Conquest, since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10. EA proudly touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch"><u>it had managed to sell 7 million copies</u></a> in just three days, leaving many to wonder why they are being tossed into bot-filled matches less than one month after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland explains that players should only find themselves fighting against Battlefield 6 bots in unique situations. Specifically, if the pre-round waiting period takes longer than about three minutes, than bots will be introduced as a last resort, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be forced to work with dozens of AI teammates for the duration of a 30-minute Conquest match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At that point, the game starts, and you can play with the bots instead of waiting,” Sirland explains. “Other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist - will join this server (as it has you on it). Each time a player joins, a bot leaves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sacrifice that gets players into a match with as little waiting as possible at the cost of filling a lobby with real people. Even if bots only temporarily fill a match, it sounds like BF Studios prefers the trade, with the alternative being wait times that could last forever for servers with low population.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">2: you see no other players<br>Well, the reason for that is you are first. You need to stick it out (or atleast give it a minute or two, or how may you are willing to try and wait for)<br>We can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in, but please spread the word!</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986037104405582136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037656707342653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exception to the rule</u></a> that sees bots eventually traded out for real players involves beginner playlists, such as Initiation Breakthrough. As made clear via an in-game mode description, bots will stick around in these matches to help players warm up for the typically more tense matches filled with real people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bots have remained a hot topic for the Battlefield 6 community for months, with BF Studios having addressed concerns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-increases-xp-gain-addresses-progression-complaints-and-targets-xp-farms-taking-up-server-space">regarding XP farms</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-bots-in-the-open-beta-insists-theyre-only-in-the-training-grounds-playlists">open beta bots</a> mutliple times in the past. Battlefield Portal fans and multiplayer playlist regulars have almost certainly encountered bots at some point, and many will no doubt continue to have their complaints as post-launch development continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like I stated in this thread earlier today - bots are only there to seed servers so they start,” Sirland said in response to a fan who expressed concern about the bot system. “The alternative would be no server under those circumstances. We will of course check for issues here too, and when and if servers spawn in the wrong way or when they shouldn’t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team at EA and BF Studios has continued listening to fan feedback as post-launch development continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to hold firm high up the leaderboards on almost every platform since being released on October 30. The third-person extraction shooter has proven to be a refreshing change of pace for many fans of the genre, introducing a post-apocalyptic landscape that encourages social interaction and collaboration rather than mindless combat.</p>



<p>It’s a sensational title that has proven it can hold its own against the titans of the genre, so much so that it has managed to earn high enough ratings to become the top-rated <span>multiplayer<strong>-only</strong></span><strong> </strong>shooter in almost ten years.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-the-shooter-of-the-decade">ARC Raiders is the Shooter of the Decade</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has stumped up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Metascore of 87</a>, which is admirable for a new IP created by a relatively young studio whose debut game earned a Metascore of 80. In terms of Metacritic alone, ARC Raiders is now the highest-rated multiplayer-exclusive shooter to hit the market in almost a decade.</p>



<p>It’s topped only by Overwatch (2016), which earned a Metascore of 91 and has a similar operating model in that it <strong>only </strong>accommodates multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p>If it weren’t for Overwatch, ARC Raiders would be lining up to be the highest-rated multiplayer-only shooter <strong>to ever be released</strong>. It’s topped in the shooter categories by games that came before, like Halo 2 (95), Gears of War (94), and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (94), but they’re all games that feature other modes and elements, including single-player campaigns.</p>



<p>With a Metascore of 87, ARC Raiders is on par with some truly heavy hitters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>



<li>Subnautica</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>



<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>



<li>Forza Motorsport 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Halo Infinite</li>



<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>



<li>Fallout 4</li>



<li>Silent Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders also shines in the ‘User Score’ rating on Metacritic. At the time of publishing, ARC Raiders boasted a User Score of 8.9, which is <strong>glowing</strong>. That aligns it with games like Metal Gear Solid, Max Payne, Resident Evil, Half-Life, StarCraft, A Link Between Worlds, Bloodborne, Portal 2, and Mass Effect 2, to name just a few games.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has created something truly special in ARC Raiders, and as the studio plans to support the game for the next ten years, it’s likely it’ll be evolving for some time to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98this-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-god-of-war-creator%E2%80%99s-graveyard-joke-draws-criticism.1345294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, a user on social media uploaded an image of their father’s grave, recalling memories of being bought their first Xbox and falling in love with gaming. By way of a tribute to that, the user had placed two Xbox controllers on the grave, saying that their late father could ‘play along from up there’.</p>



<p>David Jaffe, the creator of God of War and Twisted Metal, quoted the post and wrote ‘This is an XBOX’, echoing Microsoft’s recent marketing campaign and prompting many to criticize the developer for an ill-timed and inappropriate comment.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-david-jaffe-mocking-the-deceased">Was David Jaffe Mocking the Deceased?</h2>



<p>The recent post on social media by David Jaffe has not been met with a positive sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Jaffe was most recently in the news for uploading a YouTube video explaining that Connie Booth, a 34-year veteran of Sony, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/connie-booth-was-fired-from-playstation-its-claimed/">was <strong>fired </strong>out of the blue</a>.</p>



<p>Under the graveyard post on social media, Jaffe attempted to defend his position after gamers came for him, but his response just stoked the flames further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh shut up, you f***ing babies. My parents are dead as well, it sucks. And even WHEN they died- my dad died on Halloween and you can BET we laughed about it- we tried to accept and grieve and mourn and at the same time we didn’t become a bunch of overly serious assholes<a href="https://x.com/davidscottjaffe/status/1986283772808138817"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments under the post cast aspersions, and while some understood that Jaffe might have meant something different, most bagged on his timing and the nature of his comment.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘How desperate for attention are you?’ While another said, ‘Just because you made fun of your dad dying, it does not give you the right to do it to other people, you stinky loser.’</p>



<p>Do you think David Jaffe was in the wrong for what he said? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-process-release-date-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-finally-has-a-release-date-for-the-process-and-it%E2%80%99s-three-hours-long.1345285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>OpTic is preparing to <strong>finally release </strong>this year’s edition of The Process, a feature-length documentary detailing the ascension of OpTic Texas in this year’s Call of Duty League and Esports World Cup tournaments.</p>



<p>It has been a long time coming, with fans sitting on the edges of their seats eagerly awaiting the drop. It has been more than four months since OpTic Texas won back-to-back CDL Championship trophies, and mere weeks later went on to win big at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-trust-the-process">Trust The Process</h2>



<p>In a graphic uploaded on social media, the OpTic team revealed that The Process will be released on November 11. OpTic Roger later noted that the construction of the project was something monumental:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely appreciate the patience people have had for this project. I’ve sunk a countless amount of time into this movie and it getting the extra time made a difference. </p>



<p>18TB of footage all condensed into a 3 hour monster of a documentary. </p>



<p>Excited for you all to watch</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada in June, becoming the first team in COD esports history to claim back-to-back world titles. It came after a horrendous season that saw OpTic secure a historic losing streak, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/">failing to secure a map win</a> in <strong>eighteen attempts</strong>.</p>



<p>It was a horrific scene that had fans baulking at the squad’s prospects for the season, but a rejig of the roster seemed to turn things around when needed, and OpTic Texas stormed through the bracket at COD Champs.</p>



<p>I caught up with OpTic Texas in Kitchener during the Call of Duty League Championship, and Shotzzy, one of the team’s superstar players, informed me that winning at COD Champs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-shotzzy-completely-wash-year-champs/">would ‘wash the year’</a> of all the negativity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Consider the year well and truly washed clean.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Workers To Protest Outside Take-Two’s London Office Today]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fired-rockstar-workers-to-protest-outside-take-two%E2%80%99s-london-office-today.1345279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, it was revealed that around thirty Rockstar Games employees were fired by the company, under claims that the workers were participating in leaks and prohibited discussions about the development of GTA 6. Those dismissed by the company insist they were let go because they were unionizing.</p>



<p>In a bid to rebel, the IWGB, a UK-based workers’ union, has arranged a protest outside Take-Two’s London office, due to kick off today at 8 AM UK time.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-you-had-to-do-was-follow-the-law">All You Had to Do Was Follow The Law</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to social media, the IWGB Union explained the lay of the land, telling how Rockstar Games had ‘betrayed’ the employees let go for unionizing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar, makers of GTA, have crossed the red line. They’ve fired over 30 members of staff, all IWGB Union members, in a blatant act of union busting. They’ve done this for no other reason but to try to terrify and silence staff.</p>



<p>Not only is this illegal, but this is also a complete attack on workers’ rights and peoples’ well-being.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the development of the much-awaited GTA 6, Rockstar have chosen to take on the role of their classic game villains by breaking labor laws and firing hard-working staff making the game, betraying both workers and fans alike.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, the IWGB has arranged a protest to take place outside Take-Two’s London office later this morning.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that the employees were dismissed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for leaking information</a> about Grand Theft Auto 6 on a ‘public forum’, but many have pointed out the coincidence that every employee let go is a member of the IWGB Union.</p>



<p>The situation has drawn a mixed response from social media users, with some suggesting that ‘they must have done something wrong’. Others backing the fired employees have suggested they sue or arrange a class action lawsuit against Rockstar Games and Take-Two.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the IWGB protest will go ahead this morning in London.</p>

<p>If we find out anything else about this first game update for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, we'll let you know. And if you want to learn more about this new Hyrule Warriors game, check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>

<p>Sony’s Resident Evil film looks to be taking place in Raccoon City, according to set photos. Additionally, it seems to be taking place during winter, if all the snow is an undead giveaway. </p>



<p>Directed by smash hit Weapons’ Zach Cregger, Resident Evil is set to be the next big video game adaptation. With its release on September 18th, 2026, there’s a lot riding on the title in celebration of the game’s 30th anniversary. While we know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-film-cast-severance-emmys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s in the cast</a>, story details have been quite surface-level. What we did know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it wouldn’t be an adaptation</a>, but take from the games. Well, according to new set photos of the film in Prague, it’s taking a whole city with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-raccoon-city-to-appear-in-resident-evil-film-according-to-set-photos">Raccoon City to Appear in Resident Evil Film, According to Set Photos</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FIRST LOOK: Zach Cregger’s RESIDENT EVIL has transformed Prague into a snowy Raccoon City, filming large-scale action sequences with gunfire, explosions, and stunt driving. 🧟‍♂️🎥</p><p>📺 RE Movie Details: <a href="https://t.co/RSwZ1e2Pzk">https://t.co/RSwZ1e2Pzk</a><br>📅 Release Date: Sept 18, 2026<br>🔍 Source: The Prague… <a href="https://t.co/FGBTRPq9hj">pic.twitter.com/FGBTRPq9hj</a></p></div>— RESIDENCE of EVIL (@ROEnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/ROEnetwork/status/1985670620508463237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Prague Reporter</a>, <strong>filming has begun on the Resident Evil film</strong> in the Karlin district. The outlet was able to get photos on-set and reveals some interesting details about the shoots. For one, it seems the town <strong>will serve as Raccoon City</strong>, as one photo <strong>shows a map of the town and bus decals</strong>. Police cars with Colorado plates are also visible, indicating <strong>its version will not technically be in the Midwest</strong>. In addition, everything is covered in artificial snow, meaning the film will, in some way, <strong>take place during Winter</strong>.</p>



<p>The outlet <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also reports</a> that <strong>action scenes involving fast cars and explosions were filmed</strong> in the area. Residents there were told that filming would take place from 3 pm to 3 am from October 29th to November 2nd. The night is a fairly common element of Resident Evil, so the film looks to go all in with it. Given its upcoming release, we could see more information revealed before the year’s end. Still, the addition of Raccoon City is sure to be of note, given that a majority of titles, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-has-been-turned-into-an-arcade-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3, take place there. Perhaps we’ll see some familiar faces with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-will-not-feature-leon-kennedy-director-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon</a> and Jill? We’ll just have to wait and see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airtags-are-going-for-nearly-free-for-early-black-friday-amazon-has-sold-10k-units-today.1345204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage creates instant panic and wastes hours of your day retracing steps or tearing apart your house. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem by turning everyday items into trackable objects through the <em>Find My</em> network. A single AirTag usually costs $29 but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings a 4-pack down to $64 from the usual $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker instead of $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How AirTags Work in Real Life</h2>
<p>Each <strong>AirTag pairs with your iPhone or iPad with just a tap</strong> during setup, and immediately shows up in the Find My app amongst the rest of your Apple devices. An integrated speaker plays a sound whenever you trigger it through the app to help you locate items that are wedged between the couch cushions or deep in your bag. You can also ask Siri where your keys or wallet are, and the associated AirTag will start to beep-beep-beeping without your needing to open any apps.</p>



<p>The real magic happens when your item leaves Bluetooth range which extends about 30 feet in open space. Apple’s Find My network leverages hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the world that anonymously detect nearby AirTags and report their location back to you in a crowdsourced way. This kind of tracking works passively in the background on other people’s devices without them knowing or needing to do anything.</p>



<p>Lost Mode is the feature that turns on when you mark an item as missing in the Find My app. Immediately,<strong> the AirTag will alert you when any device in the Find My network detects it</strong>, and that provides real-time updates on where the item might be. You can also include a phone number with the AirTag, allowing a person who finds your lost item simply to tap their iPhone or any other NFC-capable smartphone on it and display your contact information to get in touch with you to return it.</p>
<p>The sharing feature lets <strong>up to five people track a single AirTag</strong>, which is perfect for household items that multiple family members use. Your partner can locate the shared car keys just as easily as you can, and everyone gets notifications if the item gets left behind. Each AirTag runs on a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year before needing replacement, and the Find My app notifies you when the battery runs low. The<strong> trackers are rated IP67 for water and dust resistance</strong> which means they survive splashes and brief submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $16 per AirTag in this 4-pack versus $29 individually, you’re getting the coverage you actually need at a price that makes sense.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-knocks-1400-off-this-laptop-i3-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-now-goes-for-pocket-change-with-299-in-free-accessories-2000641509</link>

              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

<p>Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in October, Game Freak has now rolled out Version 1.0.2.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese website for the game, this update contains bug fixes tied to Mega Evolutions, side missions and "other issues", and also makes some adjustments to ranked battles. Here's the rundown courtesy of a rough translation, and if we get hold of the English patch notes, we'll update this post.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Version 1.0.2 (6th November 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>The following bugs have been fixed:</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59syqwlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>If you have not opened the box screen since the box was full before the first Mega Evolution battle, you will definitely fail to capture a Pokemon. Also, if you proceed with a side mission that allows you to obtain a Pokemon in that state, you will not be able to complete it.</li>
<li>In some side missions, if the day/night change occurs at the same time that a skill is hit on a target, it will no longer be possible to hit the target with a skill, and the side mission will no longer be able to progress.</li>
<li>During a trainer battle, if the opposing trainer switches Pokemon and the player simultaneously Mega Evolves, the opposing trainer will not be able to send out a Pokemon and will be unable to proceed.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rank Battle Balance Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustment of points earned based on ranking so that points are not reduced depending on the outcome of the match.</li>
<li>Some battle rewards that can be received for each battle have been added and increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>*The latest update data is required to play online features.<br>
*Local communication is not compatible with previous versions. Please make sure that you and the people you play with have the same update data version.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we hear anything else significant about this latest game update, we'll let you know. And in case you missed it, The Pokémon Company has also announced it will be sharing some news about the upcoming DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a> later today, so be on the lookout for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games says it didn’t fire employees for attempting to form a union. Rather, the studio behind Grand Theft Auto 6 says that staff let go were done so for leaking company information.</p>



<p>In a new report from Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, the employees were giving out company secrets in a forum with non-Rockstar staff. This led to more than 30 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p><strong>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,”</strong> a Rockstar spokesperson told Schreier. <strong>“This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-union-s-response">What Was The Union’s Response?</h2>



<p>It just so happens, however, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone who was let go</a> also took park in a private union chat on Discord. The only people outside of Rockstar involved in the chat, they say, were labor organizers.</p>



<p>The president of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, Alex Marshall, said that Rockstar was simply <strong>“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to&nbsp;GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive for comment on the situation. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In the meantime, Take-Two Interactive is preparing for its latest quarterly earnings report on November 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ball x Pit Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ball-x-pit-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ball-x-pit-review.1345180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a new, all-consuming obsession, and that obsession is Ball x Pit. I didn't set out to replace all my free time with grinding its roguelite take on Breakout, but its reliance on strategy (with a butterfly kiss of luck) and enticing upgrade paths both on and off the playfield grabbed a hold of the primal lizard parts of my brain to the detriment of all other civilized activity. I am <em>hooked</em>. In fact, Ball x Pit is the only video game I've played since I first started it a couple weeks ago. I cannot break free from its satisfying loop of running a level and upgrading my balls, upgrading my city to unlock more balls, and then jumping right back in. It's a sickness, a sickness with no cure – and, honestly… I'm not even sure I'd want to be healed from the madness that has taken hold of me. I’ve been recommending it to everyone and, so far, those who have taken my advice inevitably reach out to tell me the same thing: "You ruined my life, you sicko." It’s fantastic. Join us. We all bounce down here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a distance, Ball x Pit looks like one of those crappy games you see advertised on TikTok or Reels. You know the ones: "We're playing a game the comments said was fake part 17," or something like that. At first blush, it does look like some endless runner game trying to hook you with playtime gems or whatever predatory garbage is in vogue these days. But, crucially, it’s <em>not</em> one of those games at all, as it’s entirely free of microtransactions and actually respects your time as it vacuums it all up. It doles out satisfying upgrades in each level and then gives you the opportunity to build up more permanent powers in your home base. There's nothing cheap or underhanded about it. It makes you feel powerful, not cheated, and even with an element of RNG in each level, it requires you to make the most out of every opportunity rather than rely on dumb luck or random chance. When you beat a level, it feels like you earned it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual gameplay seems straightforward on the surface, too: Your character, or characters, march up the playfield firing bouncing balls at wave after wave of enemies. The balls are weaponized, the enemies are crushed under the onslaught, and eventually you get to a given level’s unique boss. That's the basic loop, but the operative word there is "basic." Because, friends, Ball x Pit is much more complex. For starters, there are different kinds of balls to fire. For example, your initial character, the Warrior, starts with a special ball that imparts a "bleed" status effect that stacks up to cause extra damage on successive hits. As you defeat enemies, you’ll also pick up gems in order to level up, which then gives you a choice of balls and other power-ups to use during that specific run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are special balls with status effects or area-of-effect damage, balls that spawn more "baby balls" (weird), and loads of other options. Then there are buffs, passive effects, defensive boosts, and even allies who'll join you in the march forward, dealing out damage or even health. Some of the power ups are much better than others. The Earthquake ball, for example, deals damage around the enemy it hits and, like most of the AOE balls, becomes incredibly powerful when fully upgraded. Others, like the Wretched Onion, kind of suck. Part of the fun is finding out which upgrades work best in any given level, as well as discovering what happens when you combine certain balls with Fusions and Evolutions that mix or modify their powers even further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fusions can simply save you a slot by mashing two effects onto a single ball, but specific combos instead get the chance to evolve into a new power. For example, fusing the Horizontal Laser with the Vertical Laser creates my personal favorite, the Holy Laser. It shoots beams of pure fiery death vertically <em>and </em>horizontally on hit while also dealing AOE damage, which is as useful much as it just rules. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that fusing balls both scales the damage you are dealing and gives you room to add even more. It's hard to keep track of all the possibilities, but there's an in-game encyclopedia that shows you the combos you've unlocked. I'm more than 30 hours in and I still have fusions I haven't found yet, which I find pretty damn exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, the laser balls in any configuration do a crap-ton of damage, searing rows and columns, sometimes adding stackable status effects like radiation while also doing normal, hot laser damage. When you're fully powered up and the RNG gods have held you in their favor, it's a beautiful bloodbath. Lasers and explosions and effects are going off constantly, and the damage counters fill the screen as entire rows of enemies evaporate into experience gems, as well as gold you’ll spend back in your town between runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The town is the other half of Ball x Pit, one that's enormously important to growing your characters. In addition to earning permanent stat boosts just by playing as them, constructing certain buildings and character houses will provide buffs and bonuses as well, which you’ll absolutely need in order to make it through the later levels. But while it’s very important, the city-building part of Ball x Pit is extremely clunky – in fact, it’s probably the worst part of what I think is otherwise a flawless game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete a level, whether or not you did so successfully, you're thrown back into the town interface where you’ll build structures from blueprints you gathered out in the field. You also build resource tiles: forests for wood, fields for wheat, and rocks for… well, rocks. Those resources, in addition to gold, are required to build and upgrade new structures. Thankfully there are plenty of ways to gather resources outside of just harvesting, including during runs and with passive buildings like the stone quarry, but collecting it manually is the most fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the harvest phase, you use your unlocked characters as balls, taking aim from the bottom of the board and letting them rip, Beyblade style, in the direction of the stuff you want to hit. They then bounce off the walls and buildings, collecting resources from the resource tiles and upgrading any buildings you marked for improvement. This process is amusing but also fairly tedious, as you can move buildings around before you harvest in order to optimize their placement, but there isn’t really a convenient way to do so. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>City building is the worst part of an otherwise a flawless game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I usually end up doing is moving everything off to one side of the map, then shuffling all the parts and pieces back again to where I want them at that specific moment. It almost seems like Ball x Pit is aware of how cumbersome the city building is, because there's no penalty or resource cost for moving tiles around. What I'd love to see is some kind of option to wipe the slate clean without needing to go through and manually remove every building, or maybe a holding pen where I could drop structures temporarily while I reconfigure my layout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you will be reconfiguring your layout a lot. Building upgrades require your characters to bounce off the buildings multiple times, and if that building is in a weird location, good luck getting the trajectory right to consistently hit it enough times during the harvest phase without reorganizing half the town. I often ended up moving relevant buildings down near the launch area, which meant moving all the other stuff away… and then reorganizing it again after all is said and done. I don't like it at all. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Seth's Game DNA</h3><p>These are the games that made me the gamer I game game game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a bummer because you can’t really ignore this, as city layout is extremely important to how powerful you are in the levels themselves. Some buildings provide buffs that make the effects of other nearby buildings stronger, so their placement is crucial to your continued success. That need for careful planning is at odds with the reality of constantly shuffling tiles around when it comes time to harvest, build, and upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, building-specific issues aside, I do really like how your town structures contribute directly to the action itself. The better your city, the better your characters, and the more blueprints you find, the more options you have when it comes to a new run. It may be cumbersome to move everything around, but the results are meaningful and can sometimes be surprising in a way that is ultimately a positive. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Double Down on Strategy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat early on, you unlock a building that lets you bring two characters into battle instead of just one, adding another layer of complexity and experimentation to each run. At first, it almost feels like cheating, but it would be functionally impossible to get much further without it. I'm still figuring out which combinations work well and which ones are total crap. Since you still gain gold and experience even on a failed run, I don't even mind when I pick a total dud combo because I've still made some progress. There have also been several times where I thought I'd figured out some god-tier combo, only to get three-quarters of the way through a level and realize I have made a terrible mistake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The worst was when I paired The Warrior with The Flagellant for a New Game+ run of the first level. Balls shot by the Flagellant bounce off the bottom of the screen instead of the top, and The Warrior has no special attributes other than being your starting character. The first level boss, the Skeleton King, requires hits to the back of its skull to inflict damage. The RNG gods had graced me with some decent fusions, but all of them ended up bouncing harmlessly between his two arms out front, leaving me almost completely ineffective. An errant baby ball would sometimes bank off the wall to register a tiny amount of damage, but I ended up losing on purpose just to back out of the level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As frustrating as that was, it's emblematic of something I love about Ball x Pit: it requires strategy in almost every facet. The balls and upgrades offered to you are at the mercy of RNG, sure, but you also have the choice of which ones to use and which ones to fuse and evolve. I was able to identify good combinations and bad combinations of characters based on their attributes and would make mental notes about which pairings would work out for my specific needs as I pushed through each level. The Juggler, for example, throws balls over enemies – pairing him with The Shade, whose balls shoot from the back of the field, and then following a heavy AOE upgrade path allowed me to clear out basically any row of enemies on the board while still getting a ton of damage from balls bouncing in the back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combination of strategy and knowing how to best upgrade any given character combination for a specific level is what keeps bringing me back, over and over again, until I'm bleary eyed and tired. When everything aligns and you're wiping out entire fields of enemies, when the screen is absolutely filled with lasers and explosions and baby balls scattering in every direction, you feel an enormous sense of power. From an outside view, honing in your upgrades combined with careful building placement and frequent stat leveling from buff buildings makes it seem like Ball x Pit would feel easier over time. But it does a rare thing: instead of feeling easy, it makes you feel powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I finally did beat the main story and watched the credits around the 20-hour mark, I immediately started up New Game+. I never do that. But the entirely inconsequential story is just a small part of Ball x Pit for me. The real joy here comes from building up your powers and combos and seeing what delights will unlock themselves during the course of a run. I play for moments when the music is nearly drowned out by the sounds of explosions and laser blasts, or when I get a gold bonus for clearing the field of enemies and then doing it two, three, even five more times in a given level. It scratches an itch deep within my lizard brain. Hard work pays off, but the right combinations of upgrades mixed in with a touch of luck pays off even more.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Ball x Pit is my favorite game of 2025. Even with a clunky city building phase you can’t afford to ignore, the actual action of its Breakout-inspired runs is enormously fun. I get stuck in a "just one more run" mindset every time I sit down to play what I swear is going to be a quick round or two. Its strategies run surprisingly deep for a simple brick-breaker, rewarding smart planning and forethought more so than RNG and luck alone. It's a rare game that I’m still excited to play well after I beat the main story and, in a lot of ways, I wish I were playing it right now. If you want your life to be completely upended by a seemingly simple brick-breaking roguelite, I cannot recommend it enough.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ball-x-pit-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is all about making the most of every run as you amass a backpack full of loot and try to make it back to Speranza in one piece. And while the majority of what you find while scavenging topside will be useful materials and weapons, you'll also occasionally come across items that are designed to be sold for some extra cash. These items, known as trinkets, are designated by a small diamond symbol on their icons to indicate that they can be sold for profit. But they're not all created equally.</p><p>Trinkets come in four rarities: Common (White), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), and Epic (Purple). While there is occasionally variation between selling prices even among trinkets of the same rarity, these identifiers help to give you an idea of whether you've stumbled upon something truly special or not, with higher-tier items typically bringing in a bigger chunk of change.</p><p>In addition to being a way to rake in more money, a few trinkets also have uses back in Speranza. Whether it's an item a trader is seeking for a quest or a material to aid in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-all-scrappy-upgrades-and-where-to-get-the-items/1100-6535951/" data-ref-id="1100-6535951">upgrading Scrappy</a>, you'll want to be certain you don't sell something you're going to need later.</p><p>We've compiled all of the trinkets in Arc Raiders alongside their rarity, selling price, and information about whether you need them for a quest. There are certain to be additional trinkets added down the line, too, so we'll be sure to update this when that time comes.</p><h2>All trinkets and prices in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Here is a list of every trinket currently available in Arc Raiders sorted by selling price. Please also note that it lists whether or not you'll want to hang on to it to complete a quest or upgrade.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Trinket</th><th scope="col">Rarity</th><th scope="col">Price</th><th scope="col">Quest Use</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Faded Photograph</td><td>Common</td><td>$640</td><td>Lance's Tea Party (x2)</td></tr><tr><td>Rubber Duck</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>Lance's Tea Party (x2)</td></tr><tr><td>Bloated Tuna Can</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Torn Book</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cat Bed</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$1,000</td><td>Scrappy Upgrade Tier 4 (x1)</td></tr><tr><td>Coffee Pot</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Expired Pasta</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Empty Wine Bottle</td><td>Common</td><td>$1,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Dart Board</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Film Reel</td><td>Rare</td><td>$2,000</td><td>Movie Night (x1)</td></tr><tr><td>Air Freshener</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Painted Box</td><td>Common</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Light Bulb</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Poster of Natural Wonders</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Very Comfortable Pillow</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>Scrappy Upgrade Tier 5 (x3)</td></tr><tr><td>Pottery</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Rosary</td><td>Rare</td><td>$2,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Music Album</td><td>Rare</td><td>$3,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Silver Teaspoon Set</td><td>Rare</td><td>$3,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Fine Wristwatch</td><td>Rare</td><td>$3,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Statuette</td><td>Rare</td><td>$3,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Vase</td><td>Rare</td><td>$3,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Music Box</td><td>Rare</td><td>$5,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Red Coral Jewelry</td><td>Rare</td><td>$5,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Playing Cards</td><td>Rare</td><td>$5,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Breathtaking Snow Globe</td><td>Epic</td><td>$7,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Lance's Mixtape (5th Edition)</td><td>Epic</td><td>$10,000</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's every trinket in Arc Raiders, so get out there and start looting so you can build up your savings.
