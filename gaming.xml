		<p>It’s time to roll through a brand new Katamari game, as Once Upon a Katamari has been revealed for Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s coming out on 24th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Upon A KATAMARI - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Mrm4i8L9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will let you roll through historical settings, like Edo Japan, as you build you Katamari ball by glooping up all things in your way. To help you do this you’ll be able to make use of pick ups like magnet and rockets.</p>
<p>And you’ll be able to style it your way with a customisable look and body shape. That will help you stand out in the online multiplayer modes which support up to four players, competing to make the biggest Katamari possible.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33.1258062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 580.88) for its GeForce graphics cards. It's optimized for the upcoming game Mafia: The Old Country, due to launch on August 8, as well as the highly acclaimed JRPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-1-4-0-patch-is-now-live-introducing-nvidia-dlss-and-intel-xess-frame-generation-support-visual-polish-across/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> yesterday, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has introduced NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation with update 1.4. NVIDIA has confirmed though that this actually extends to DLSS Multi Frame Generation, allowing owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs to run the game at even higher frame rates. </p>



<p>A recent update also added DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA support to the popular open world zombie survival game 7 Days to Die. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation in the game, with the option to activate DLSS Multi Frame Generation via the NVIDIA app override feature.</p>



<p>Today marks the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Take</a>, a first-person psychological horror game crafted by Surgent Studios, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera</a>. Featuring a cast of acclaimed actors (Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and even Remedy's Sam Lake), Dead Take offers players a nightly visit to a not-so-common haunted mansion. The game will include day one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, here's a video of F1 25 showing off its path tracing glory with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation accelerating frame rates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also had another announcement to make: after a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, GeForce GPUs based on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will transition to receiving quarterly security updates for the next three years (through October 2028). The company notes that lifetime support will reach up to 11 years, 'well beyond' industry standards. Furthermore, they will extend Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system's planned end-of-life, to ensure gamers continue to receive the latest day zero optimizations for new games and apps.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this Game Ready driver (580.88) adds support for 62 new G-SYNC Compatible displays. NVIDIA also fixed several bugs, as noted <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/580.88/580.88-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the driver's changelog</a>:</p>

            <p>
The office seems to be empty save for a grinning little girl who yells "hey mister, wake up!" in what sounds like amateur Simmish, then immediately vanishes around the corner. The building consists of grainy, glass-walled compartments lined with illuminated facades displaying kanji letters, arranged along a central corridor. I think I'm on the ninth floor.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It is all, dare I say, a bit liminal. The walls and desks have the texture of ash. The fluorescent ceiling tubes taper off and vanish into the black interiors of mirrored alcoves at either end of the corridor. There are piercing red bulbs here and there that could indicate the best route to the exit, and what I think are deactivated elevators with parted doors. 
</p>

<p>
It would probably feel less eerie if I were more mobile. As I may have mentioned, I'm taped to a chair. To move, I have to wiggle my body mass frantically with the WASD keys, while peering around with the mouse controls. I've never been taped to an office chair IRL, somewhat to my surprise, but Chairbound feels like a pretty authentic and hi-fi recreation of the experience, in that getting anywhere is maddening. Oh and yes, there's that LED timer strapped to my chest, its 10-minute countdown considerately angled upward. This creates a certain urgency.
</p>
<p>
I have attempted to beat Chairbound four times so far. Each attempt began with my squirming and writhing my way out into the central corridor, in pursuit of the weird little girl. There is always a squeaky rubber duck on a desk nearby. If I don't mind sacrificing a few seconds, I can trundle up close and seize the duck in my left or right hand. Then I can squeeze it, bringing a note of comedy to my tragic plight. It may be the duck has some other, grander role to play in this epic drama, or it may be that the developers/my captors have placed it there to fuck with me. I strongly suspect the duck to be a test of my character.

<p>
Once the question of whether to take the duck is resolved, I have to worry about getting down the stairs at the end of the hall. There may be other stuff to find in the other rooms, perhaps even a strategically hidden pair of scissors, but when you have a timer strapped to your chest, it's hard to think about collectibles. 
</p>
<p>
Each staircase has an access ramp that looks convenient but invariably tips me over when I reach the bottom, and when you flip over in Chairbound, you're toast. The first time it happens, I attempt to jerk myself across the landing to the next staircase down, hoping that I might tumble rightway up, but it's impossible to build momentum while prone. I contemplate waiting for the timer to run down, then take the coward's way out and hit the restart button.
</p>
<p>
The next two attempts go much the same way. On the fourth try, I make an important discovery, so epochal and historic that I am going to swathe it in spoiler tags. <span tabindex="0">There's another, unoccupied rolling chair I can shunt down the ramp to serve as a buffer, breaking my slide and stopping me falling over.</span> Armed with this knowledge, I can brave the mysteries of the eighth floor. What will I find there? Let's reconvene to discuss my progress tomorrow, 1st August, when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281410/Ells_Tales_Chairbound/">Chairbound releases on Steam</a>.

Along with rebalanced weapons and other improvements and adjustments, players should have new loot to grind for and more challenging hunts to contend with. </p><p>The bad news is that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still isn’t where it deserves to be on PC in terms of performance, and the general sluggishness with which new content updates have arrived has arguably led lots of players to bounce of into other multiplayer games. <em>Monster Hunter Worlds </em>had a faster cadence of new updates culminating in the much-celebrated<em> Iceborne</em> expansion 18 months later. In addition to having a spottier post-launch calendar, many fans also feel like Wilds has had deeper problems it needs to address right out of the gate, especially on PC. </p><figure id="" data-id="a23a86e643dbf2566accc1bc51d35f56" data-recommend-id="image://a23a86e643dbf2566accc1bc51d35f56" data-format="png" data-width="584" data-height="404" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows new game sales by Capcom.

In fact, the four-year-old game almost sold <em>more</em> than <em>Wilds</em> over the last three months as the latter has fallen off a cliff even while rival games like<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> continue going strong, likely thanks at least in part to great word of mouth.</p><p>Multiple shareholders asked Capcom about the situation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/stock/meeting.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/stock/meeting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a meeting earlier this month</a></span>. “There have been concerns raised regarding recent titles, including insufficient content volume and optimization issues,” said one. “What are the Company’s plans for addressing these matters going forward?” Another asked, “Are the development staff aware of the feedback being shared on social media and message boards regarding <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>?” The company said it reviews all feedback but didn’t have anything more concrete to offer at the time. </p><p>While an “overwhelmingly negative” rating on Steam with just 14 percent of the last 14,000 reviews being positive is certainly doing the game no favors, I think some of the issues go deeper than just a lack of optimization on PC. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ main campaign <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">is fun and breezy but also streamlined to the point of making much of the game feel perfunctory</a></span>. The battles and combat are top-notch, but the overall progression and expiration leave much to be desired. It’s a good game but not the type you rush to convince your friends to play with you at the moment. We’ll see if August’s updates can begin turning that around. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-quest-difficulty-talisman-update-1851787394]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, this one notably bringing sweet relief to couples forced to have a third wheel everywhere as it adds in a highly requested two-player expeditions mode. This new option doesn't change the game all that much--it simply lets two people play together as opposed to the solo and trio options that were available before. You'll now also find that the Expedition Type setting name has been changed to Number of Players, and the game has apparently been balanced for just two players as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of quality-of-life improvements listed in the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-102?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NR_Patch102" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a>, one big one is that new filtering options are available on the relic effect filter screen so you have a "more precise selection of relic effects." If you choose multiple effects for one condition, any of your relics that match up with your chosen effects will show up too, but if you choose multiple effects for several conditions, only relics that have those exact conditions will be displayed. You can set up to 100 relic presets now as well, and there's an option to sell and favorite acquired relics in the rewards and purchasing menus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A movie adaptation of Bloober Team's psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>is in the works, with production duties being handled by&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;It</i>&nbsp;writer Gary Dauberman through his Coin Operated banner.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Dauberman has secured the rights to the IP, but the movie has yet to find a writer or a director. Naturally, that also means casting hasn't started yet; it's likely to be a while before we know who's playing Marianne (assuming she's the lead) or who else will be joining her.</p>

<p>In a statement, Dauberman says&nbsp;<em>The Medium</em>'s "compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals" make it a "natural" fit for a movie adaptation. Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, meanwhile, says he has a "deep sense" that Dauberman is the "perfect partner" for his studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-medium-movie-dual-worlds.jpg?itok=MqpG18iU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-medium-movie-dual-worlds.jpg?itok=QmO4HyN5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>This movie is likely to be a separate entity to the TV show, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/medium-tv-show-announced-by-bloober-team" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2022</a> (and of which very little has been heard since). That show is a co-production with Polish studio Platige Image, whereas the movie doesn't seem to involve that outfit at all.</p>

<p>In his statement, Dauberman says he has "no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways", and it seems like he's not the only one who believes that.</p>

<p>Not only did Konami choose Bloober Team to develop its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, but the company has also teamed up with the Polish studio again for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em></a>, which is currently slated for release...well, sometime in the future, I expect.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-james-bloober-team.jpg?itok=WWLlCt-Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-james-bloober-team.jpg?itok=PSyGP_ny 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team appears to be the new steward of the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>is also far from the only movie based on a video game that's currently in the works. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-cast" rel="nofollow">Nintendo's live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>film</a>, a movie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow">based on ghost-hunting game&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, and, for reasons known only to Radagon himself, an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-delays-elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-due-to-tsunami-warning-in-japan-as-massive-earthquake-off-russia-triggers-evacuations-across-pacific">a short delay due to a tsunami hitting Japan</a>, FromSoftware has released Elden Ring Nightreign patch 1.02, which finally adds duos mode to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a> dropped players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. There was no way to play two-player co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first"><u>IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</u></a>, the Nightreign lead developer discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options for launch. When asked why there was no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a random matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.02, out now across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S, adds two-player expeditions, a feature sorely lacking from the multiplayer-focused Elden Ring spin-off since launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After downloading the update, you’ll be able to start an expedition with two players. In the patch notes, below, FromSoftware said to reflect this change, the “Expedition Type” setting name has been changed to “Number of Players.” The game balance will be adjusted to the current number of players, the legendary developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, new filtering options have been added to the Relic Effect filter screen to allow a more precise selection of Relic effects. The patch also increases the number of Relic presets that can be registered to 100, and adds a feature to sell and favorite acquired Relics in the rewards and purchasing menus.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other notable changes include several UI adjustments and improvements, an adjustment for the probability of shifting earth occurring in Limveld, and the removal of the feature that causes the session to be disconnected when a certain amount of time passes without any action when the number of expedition participants is set to “1.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And amid the ongoing debate about the game's difficulty while playing single-player, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-director-has-soloed-every-boss-without-relics-and-wants-players-to-know-its-very-possible-to-see-everything"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign's director has revealed he soloed every boss without Relics</u></a>, and wanted players to know it's "very possible" to see everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign Update 1.02 patch notes:<br>New features &amp; improvements</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Two Player Expeditions.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You may now start an expedition with two Players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Good things come to those who wait. In a world of instant gratification, Playdate are doing things differently with their ridiculously charismatic handheld. Some of that wait was unintentional, the team initially caught unawares by the popularity of their new handheld, but some of it was by design, with the console’s key games released weekly, as part of an ungoing season of releases. With Playdate now fully available, and the recent launch of its Season 2 games, it feels like the perfect time to review the canary-coloured console, amidst the stacked 2025 roster of handhelds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Say Hello to Playdate!!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdF3CnFvxg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Playdate is a handheld that’s built on classic design briefs, while adding in one almighty kick back against the status quo. On first impressions, it looks like a Game Boy Pocket that’s been squashed and stretched back out in a kitchen accident while rolling out pizza bases. That familiarity is enhanced by its simple face controls – a cross shaped D-pad and two input buttons – and its incredible-looking monochrome screen. There’s a joyful sense of nostalgia that’s hard to ignore, but Panic have made sure that there’s plenty to separate the Playdate from its forefathers.</p>


<p>First, primary, and most obviously is the metal crank. This little analogue crank arm with its yellow handle protrudes from the right-hand side of the console, and it’s there to disrupt, differentiate and innovate, which, let’s face it, is not what we’ve come to expect in the video game console market outside of Nintendo.</p>


<p>It’s there to give developers a new way to control their games, adding things like true fishing mechanics to some, and generally letting devs’ imagination run wild. One of my absolute favourite games from Season One, Crankin’s Time Travel Adventures, sees you turning the crank in an effort to get a stick man to his date on time, and it causes far too much hilarity for a console you can take on the bus.</p>
<p>After the crank, you can’t help but be drawn to the impressively sharp screen. Coming in at just 400×240 and launching without a backlight to illuminate it, this is a screen that manages to be thoroughly retro – if the light is being turned off, it’s time to stop playing unless you want to use a torch – while boasting all the clarity and precision you’d expect from a modern screen.</p>
<p>There’s a single front-firing mono speaker, with a cool little metal grill, and besides the wonderful bleeps and bloops that it delivers to your ears, it goes more than loud enough if you need it to. There’s also a 3.5mm jack socket for a wired pair of headphones, and while there is Bluetooth, it’s not currently usable.</p>

<p>While this is a retro-inspired handheld, the UI and the way your interact with it shows plenty of modernity. A silver lock button at the top edge apes modern smartphones, and a cute little home button brings up the central menu, giving you access to settings and other essential features. There’s 4GB of flash memory for storing games, and you can scroll through them in a simple rotary list, even using the crank to do so if you want. While there’s no Bluetooth support, there is Wi-Fi, and you can access the Playdate Catalog, the online store, or receive over-the-air updates with a suitable connection.</p>
<p>This is also how you’re sent the latest games each season, and one of the greatest delights of the Playdate is the flashing notification light that tells you a new game has arrived. Initially, the console launched with Season 1, which brought players 24 games across 24 weeks. It has to be one of the greatest ideas in console launch history, avoiding the highs and lows of game release schedules, and making each one an event.</p>
<p>From Casual Birder, a weird but wonderful little RPG about taking pictures of birds, to Boogie Loops, a fun diversion that lets you create musical loops while pandas and pizzas have a dance, there’s just a heap of creativity to everything that Panic feeds you, and that’s continued through into the brand new Season 2, which has been smaller in scale, with twelve titles rather than twenty-four, but has proven to be no less fun and characterful.</p>
<p>Chief among them, at least personally, has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/playdate-season-2-unearths-the-best-game-about-digging-since-minecraft/">Dig Dig Dino</a>. Some of that comes from a deep-seated love for dinosaurs that I share with my son, but this manages to make a fun and continually appealing game out of digging. Ostensibly, it’s like a roguelite with a spade, but there’s just something eternally endearing about the visuals, the mechanics, and how you can dip in and out of it.</p>

<p>I’ve also loved Fulcrum Defender. This shooter has a killer soundtrack, and uses the crank to turn your aiming reticule, attempting to pick off the approaching enemies, while levelling up your abilities, expanding your means of fighting them off with new weaponry or increased ammo. As with many Playdate games, it’s a true pick-up-and-play handheld experience, and you can dip in and out of the idiosyncratic lineup as you wish.</p>
<p>If you want a sense of the random, unexpected and darkly humorous thread that runs through Playdate’s output and outlook, then Blippo is the perfect example. This turns your Playdate into a black and white TV, with an 11-week-long showcase of the weirdest TV you’ll have seen since Channel 4 in the 80s.</p>
<p>There’s sci-fi shows, avant-garde dance programming, teletext-like sections, interviews about… well, I’m not entirely sure what they’re about, but you’ll find yourself frozen in front of your Playdate each week as you watch them. The fact that it’s a finite show – new content has been dropping each Thursday – makes it all the more special, but I truly hope that there’s more. The world in general needs more of this.</p>

<p>What makes Playdate even better is that it’s always waiting for you. Unlike most of the handheld devices I’ve owned in the past couple of years, Playdate holds onto power for up to two weeks, so when you pick it up, it’s ready to go. With eight hours of actual use, that’s a lot of rounds of Fulcrum Defender.</p>
<p>It also fits in your pocket. I laughably tried to put my Switch 2 in my pyjama pocket the other day, and while it didn’t fall out, I looked like I was trying to smuggle a chopping board. The Playdate, meanwhile, has a smaller footprint than most mobile phones, and you never feel that it’s a pain to take out with you, or to chuck it in your bag. Admittedly, frantically spinning the crank does get you a few odd looks on the train, but this is 2025 and, let’s face it, we’re all a little odd.</p>
<p>Playdate is an open platform too, and you can sideload games from places like itch.io, as well as design your own via the SDK and a web browser. Playdate is clearly Panic’s passion project, but they want it to be yours too. I’ve rarely been tempted to create my own game, but for the Playdate, I’m planning out artstyles and thinking out how the crank can be used. Thanks to the unique, retro-like framing, it feels genuinely approachable, while tinkering with Unreal Engine 5 is clearly not.</p>
<p>Are there any downsides? My biggest gripe is the lack of a backlit screen, not least because I often play late into the night, and while it’s briefly amusing to huddle up next to a lamp, or seek out direct sunlight, there is a reason we haven’t returned to the dark times before backlights. Heck, even a Kindle is backlit, so yes, if there was one thing I’d change, that would be it.</p>

<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fde7eddc2247/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Level-5 announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> would be treated to a Photo Mode in an upcoming July update. Rather unsurprisingly — given that today is the 31st July and all — the dev has revealed that the update has been pushed back to <em>next</em> month, but this is no bad thing, because it looks like it's going to be a big one.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250731/">Fantasy Life website</a>, Level-5 states that it is "currently working to deliver multiple new features in a single update," so ver. 1.5.0 will be much more than a photo op. The dev then goes on to outline some of the upcoming features, revealing that mounts will be getting an overhaul (hello, climbing and double jumps!), a new camera angle will be added, and you'll be able to switch up your party formation on the fly with a new Weird Pad option.</p>
<p>We imagine that there will be more than this added in the next update, but for now, here's a little more detail on the above features that will accompany Photo Mode in ver. 1.5.0.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Life i ver. 1.5.0 (Coming August 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Mount Performance Enhancements<br>
Dash speed will be increased, and mounts will be able to perform double jumps and climb cliffs.</strong></h3>
<p>You'll be able to ride mounts at a higher speed, and double jump will also be unlocked.<br>
In addition, a new feature will allow you to climb cliffs while remaining mounted.</p>
<h3><strong>New Camera Feature for Distant View at Base Camp<br>
New craftable objects will also be added.</strong></h3>
<p>The camera's movement range within your base camp will be expanded, allowing you to see farther into the distance.<br>
New craftable objects are also planned to be added.</p>
<h3><strong>Party Formation Management via the Weird Pad<br>
A new option will also allow you to remove players during multiplayer.</strong></h3>
<p>By using the Weird Pad, you'll be able to change your party's formation at any time.<br>
A new planned feature also lets you remove players during multiplayer sessions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-revenue-up-following-thousands-of-microsoft-layoffs.1257954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its fiscal information for the final quarter of 2025, as well as for the year as a whole, and despite thousands of layoffs earlier this month, the company's revenue continues to climb.</p>

<p>Per its Q4 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, Microsoft's revenue grew by 15% for the year overall, and its quarterly revenue jumped by 18% when compared to last year's Q4 earnings. There's pretty much no area in which Microsoft's finances aren't growing.</p>

<p>When it comes to Xbox, Microsoft's gaming wing is doing just fine as well. The Xbox division saw its "content and services revenue" increase by 13% compared to last year's fourth quarter, and, as noted by TweakTown's <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1950666422742393018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Derek Strickland</a>, Xbox earned a record-breaking $23.45 billion in revenue this fiscal year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=d1b5dt1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=-BMrdYBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's revenue was no doubt bolstered by releases like&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Xbox now has "500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices", and that it is the "top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter", although one would hope Xbox is the top publisher on its own hardware, honestly.</p>

<p>Nadella says that revenue from Game Pass reached "nearly $5 billion for the first time", which feels like another slightly strange way to phrase the achievement; "nearly" reaching a figure for the first time doesn't quite feel like the win Nadella seems to think it is.</p>

<p>Still, these figures will be very encouraging for Microsoft, although they won't be anywhere near as encouraging for the nearly-9,000 employees (there's that word again!) who lost their jobs as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive layoff wave</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>That layoff wave also saw Xbox subsidiaries like Rare and The Initiative affected; the former's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>was canceled</a>, while the latter's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot was shuttered</a>, along with the studio as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=DvXsbqdn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=hd0mdPlZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox canceled at least two projects earlier this year and shuttered one of its subsidiary studios.</figcaption></figure><p>Between those layoffs and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">several</a> earlier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">rounds</a> of job cuts, it feels particularly galling that Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home an eye-watering payrise</a> back in October, but that's just the hyper-corporate world we live in, I suppose.</p>

<p>Whether or not Microsoft and Xbox continuing to do these kinds of numbers will affect their approach to keeping staff on in the future is unclear, but I suspect the answer is no. Stay tuned for more.</p>

We commission each other, stream with each other, and need every community in order to exist. Lots of us are in multiple of these communities as well, participating in or hosting the things on both Steam and itch.io. I’ve seen people in each of these groups react, and give a call to action.”</p><p>There’s good reason lewdtubers feel Steam and itch.io’s censorship issue affects them too, especially given how the two fields so frequently interact. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/podgekinn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/podgekinn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podgekinn</a></span>, a goblin lewdtuber and adult voice actor, saw Steam and itch.io’s policy changes as part of a larger pattern. When they spoke with <em>Kotaku</em>, they directly pointed to Fansly’s Terms of Service update from late June, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/fansly-outlaws-furry-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/fansly-outlaws-furry-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effectively banned furry content</a></span>. At the time, Fansly said its guidelines were changed “to closely comply with our payment processors.”</p><p>“I don’t think VTubers are uniquely at risk, but we do definitely face some additional challenges,” Podgekinn told <em>Kotaku</em>. “For example, many creators using furry or furry-adjacent avatars have now had to re-design their models for adult content on Fansly, as well as delete all of their previous content using those models, or risk being banned.”</p><p>Kira mentioned the “overlap” between lewdtubers and various other fields. For example, some lewdtubers perform voice work for adult video games–Podgekinn included–and their work was hit in the latest payment processor-based censorship wave.</p><p>“I voice for some of the games that have been impacted and it has put a lot of fear and uncertainty into my career both as a voice actor and an 18+ creator,” they said. “The Fansly ban is the same payment processor issue that Steam and Itch are facing, and that pressure is impacting every adult creator to re-assess what we do, and in some cases completely shift gears on our content.”</p><h2 id="h770726"><a id=""></a>For VTubers, a sense of solidarity</h2><figure id="" data-id="04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-recommend-id="image://04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1381" data-height="943" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->YunadereVA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-recommend-id="image://04e55a659d4101644a2b45af35df1e1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1381" data-height="943" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="YunadereVA with a knife in her mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many VTubers are internet denizens of yore who are intimately familiar with online censorship. To them, Steam and itch.io are the latest casualties in a very lengthy war. One VTuber we spoke to referenced the Tumblr NSFW ban in a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>. Another lewdtuber, who originally began as an adult voice actor, described MasterCard and Visa as having “really strict and vague guidelines” that creators have had to manage “for years.” That lewdtuber, who asked to remain anonymous, also mentioned the wider issue of VTuber censorship on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, drawing a throughline between payment processor restrictions and ongoing censorship against VTubing as a medium.</p><p>“I think lewdtubers are especially vulnerable because they’re at the intersection of several groups that get treated the most harshly by restrictions online,” that lewdtuber told <em>Kotaku</em>. “VTubers are often censored and treated as inherently sexual on platforms like Twitch and YouTube, even if they don’t make NSFW content, so lewdtubers often get flack from both platforms and fellow VTubers. Payment processors are also quite weird about lewdtuber content and anime porn in general. There’s a lot of weird animosity between lewdtubers and IRL camgirls, too—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yoRdFoFJaCY-AGfD9W0wQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yoRdFoFJaCY-AGfD9W0wQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projekt Melody</a></span> for instance received a lot of negative backlash when she started streaming on Chaturbate and got super popular. Needless to say, it’s pretty rough out here.”</p><p>YouTube and Twitch are notorious for taking punitive action toward VTubers. ASMR VTubers commonly face warnings or strikes for their content on YouTube, even though their material follows the platform expectations. Meanwhile, Twitch bans often provide little context for VTubers to understand why they have been temporarily pulled from streaming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/YunadereVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/YunadereVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuna</a></span>, an adult voice actor and lewdtuber, stressed that creators across all content forms will increasingly have to ask themselves, “Will what I make be acceptable in the eyes of the platform?”</p><p>“A point that I’d like to see more in posts is that this affects more than just NSFW content,” Yuna told<em> Kotaku</em>. “Thinking ahead in the future, I’m worried that these companies (not just payment processors) will pressure us to conform to their ideals. I don’t want that, nor should you.”</p><figure id="" data-id="69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-recommend-id="image://69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Podgekinn</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-recommend-id="image://69718711afdd94d704110c2845d6e5d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Podgekinn, a goblin VTuber, next to a mirror." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The entire adult VTubing space is under increased pressure at the moment. Yet the feeling in the air among lewdtubers is one of unity and collective activism. Podgekinn encourages VTuber fans to speak with their wallet and get in touch with their local representatives. Yuna suggests others should “let the payment processors know what you think” and discuss online deplatforming “with friends or your platform no matter the size.”</p><p>Payment processor censorship is awful–remote, financial corporations dictating what can and cannot be sold or hosted on independent platforms goes nowhere good. But if consumers rise up and fight on behalf of their favorite content creators, be they game developers, lewdtubers, or something else, then change just might occur.</p><p>“I think for the fans, their power lies in their number,” Kira told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We can challenge the payment processors if we make them know how much of a concern this is for us, through sheer volume of calls asking for change.”</p><p><em>(Disclosure: Podgekinn has provided voice work for Shady Corner Games, a studio for which reporter Ana Valens is an affiliate.

            <p>It's been an interesting year for Capcom, so far. After the successful launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> earlier this year, the keystone franchise for the developer appears to have hit a snag, as sales have declined rapidly in the post-launch window. As the game released, it broke records for Capcom as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">its fastest-selling game ever</a>, and enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-biggest-physical-launch-of-any-ps5-game-in-japan">the biggest physical launch</a> of any game in the series.</p>
<p>Per Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">latest financial results</a>, however, it's clear that the initial fervour around the game has died down. In the last quarter, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies - that's only a bit higher than the 389k copies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> managed to shift in the same period. And that game is four years old.</p>

<p>This significant sales falloff is probably due to a couple of factors. Firstly, there has been plenty of criticism of the game for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">poor optimisation and lack of end-game content</a>. PC players, in particular, have been frustrated by a perceived lack of support for the game on the platform (with some player noting it was literally unplayable for a while due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-related-pc-improvements-coming-this-week-says-capcom"> issues with shader compilation and stuttering frame rates)</a>. Though Capcom has consistently been applying patches to the game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge"> it's clearly not enough</a> to stem the sales bleed.</p>

<p>The result? Capcom's share price has dropped significantly in Japan. The company's share price sat at t ¥4,283 at the end of Wednesday, as of this morning's market opening, it was down nearly 10 percent. Perhaps frustratingly for the company, though, it's operating profit was actually up 90.8 percent year-on-year - it's amazing to see what an impact the perceived slump in just the Monster Hunter series can have on the markets. Capcom insists brand health is still strong, going as far as pointing out the strength of legacy series titles:</p>
<p>"Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth."</p>
<p>Attempts to put Monster Hunter Wilds back on course continue, and just this week Capcom announced a rejig of the game's roadmap to address player concerns<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap"> and move planned features up the schedule</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the Devil May Cry series (which hasn't seen a wholly new release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition">Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition</a> in 2020) has proved to be a smash hit for the publisher over the past few months. Per the financials, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> sold 1.782m units in the last quarter alone (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-anime-boosts-devil-may-cry-5-sales-to-over-10m">bringing total sales of the game to over 10.5m</a>). The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-hd-collection">Devil May Cry HD Collection</a> sold 594k in the last quarter, and Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition sold 495k in the same time period. That means overall series sales rose 3m, up to 36m as of June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>Capcom attributes these bumper sales figures to "the series' synergies with the newly released anime series", despite a lot of criticism from fans about the quality of the animated show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Our reviewer seemed to like it to some degree</a>, although popular consensus would say that it's a bit too juvenile for most tastes (and deviates a fair amount from the source material, to boot).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Devil May Cry series has also seen plenty of sales over the past six months, and there was even a Humble Bundle deal (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/devil-may-cry-devil-trigger-collection">the Devil Trigger Collection</a>) that was live from 16th July through to 31st July that managed to shift 13,182 units, raising £25,285 for charity.</p>
<p>Overall? Despite share price woes in the short term, it's clear Capcom is still in a very healthy place, and - here's hoping - we'll get an announcement about the future of the Devil May Cry series soon. DMC1 remake, anyone?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter]]></content:encoded>

That sub-header quote from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> has made us sad now. Poor Agent 47. It must be lonely being an insane psychopath who spends his time flying around the world, looking cool, getting free clobber, and offing folk in trendy nightclubs.</p>
<p>However, chin up, baldy, as we've got some good news that involves you: Feral Interactive has just announced that Hitman Absolution is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 in late 2025 and TBC 2026, respectively.</p>
<p>This follows on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> alongside the Switch 2 back in June.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kihgwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here are some more early details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hitman Absolution features all the series’ hallmarks of stealth, distraction and disguise, while revealing 47 as a more complicated and thoughtful character, aware of the effects of his actions, for both good and evil.</p>
<p><em>Absolution</em>’s missions invite players to explore and experiment as they stalk their targets, engineering opportunities to strike from the shadows or, when the bullets fly, unleashing an arsenal of weapons, gadgets and anything else that may come to hand. Whether executing a silent hit or creating mayhem, players have no end of inventive ways to approach their targets, with opportunities to beat their high scores and meet each mission’s multiple Challenges."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think it's fair to say that Absolution was <em>quite divisive</em> amongst critics when it launched back in 2012, and for what it's worth, this writer did initially kind of hate it when it came out. It was just so far removed from the vibe and style of a 'proper' Hitman, it really didn't hit well.</p>
<p>However! It has to be said that a replay a year or two later, away from the excitement and noise of release week, well, it's a fine enough action game if you just take it on its own terms, really.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to iOS and Android, and Feral says that more details on the Switch versions will be coming "later this year". We'll keep you updated on this one as we find out more.</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilities—a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>
