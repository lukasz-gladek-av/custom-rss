If the option for Rest is greyed out, along with a somewhat vague “cannot use at current mission progression status” text, you’ll have some troubleshooting to do. The most likely culprit is that you’re partway through chapter five. This chapter is all about the weather in each region going crazy and has the environments locked to specific states. Yes, as weird as it seems, you’re introduced to this feature for only a few quests before having it temporarily locked away. Either way, <strong>reaching the final quest in chapter five will restore the Rest option.</strong></p><p>That should fix the problem for good, although you might see this restriction again even after completing chapter five.

Leaving the party and resetting the game should do the trick. Another solution that’s reportedly helped some is talking to a Support Desk Palico at one of the base camps. Claiming any leftover content or completing your Limited Bounties could set things right again. Otherwise, your best bet is to reset the game or try to play in offline mode.</p><hr><p>Whether you’re on the hunt for specific endemic life or vying for another go at an area’s Apex, rest is a great shortcut. Just try not to use up all your guild points doing it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survive-the-fall-the-first-preview.1163979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/survive-the-fall-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hands-on with the first few hours of this promising post-apocalyptic action RPG.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Long before Bethesda took the reins of the series and Walton Goggins smeared on the ghoul make-up for his spellbinding turn in its adapted TV show, Fallout was an isometric action RPG viewed from a bird’s eye perspective. It’s that classic style of wasteland-wandering that the upcoming Survive the Fall appears to be using as its reference point, at least if the first few hours of the game I got my hands on are anything to go by. This deadly post-apocalyptic tale of survival builds on the original Fallout’s template – quite literally in the case of its robust camp development system – and its squad-based combat and scavenging help it craft an experience that feels fresh, even if the somewhat static story presentation prevents its personality from totally shining through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike so many other post-apocalypses, Survive the Fall’s ruined world wasn’t caused by man’s own nuclear negligence. Instead, it seems that humanity got a dose of the sort of disaster that made the dinosaurs drop dead, when a comet collided with the earth and wiped out a significant slice of the world’s population. It also left a smoldering crater that leaks a toxic mist called Stasis, and those who survived either avoid it like the interplanetary plague it is or embrace it, absorbing its otherworldly power to mutate into stronger forms at the expense of their own humanity. Throughout Survive the Fall, your growing squad of scavengers must build bonds with the various factions found scattered around its three biomes in order to survive and thrive, from the Stasis-huffing Shroomers to the mysterious cult known only as the Sighted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I undertook each new task from Survive the Fall’s countless quest-givers, I took an instant liking to its squad-based setup. As you steer your party of up to three survivors around the sprawling national park area that serves as the setting for the beginning of the story, you can either manually search through abandoned chests for chemical compounds or chop down trees for lumber, or you can just tap a button to delegate the gruntwork to one of your cohorts allowing you to divert your attention elsewhere. It just feels more natural to divide each task up rather than forcing you to be hands-on with everything yourself while your AI companions stand around like bored children, and it speeds up the process of ransacking each settlement you come across. The only downside is that my view did become a little cluttered with button prompts anytime there were a number of interactive elements bunched together too closely in the environment, but thankfully those occasions were rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also team-based. I tended to approach each encounter with the various marauders and ghouls with stealth as my priority, given that rifle and shotgun ammunition seemed so scarce at least in this early part of Survive the Fall’s story. Thus I treated each infiltration of an enemy camp not unlike a careful stalk through the recent Commandos: Origins – hiding in long grass, throwing stones to create distractions, crouch-walking around the clearly marked enemy vision cones and finally slitting their throats before ordering one of my post-apocalyptic pals to hide the body for me. There are also some satisfying environmental hazards to take advantage of, from obligatory explosive barrels to dangling cargo pallets that can be dropped onto a patrolling guard with a well-timed rifle shot.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Survive the Fall - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It felt good to carefully clear out each cluster of cultists, but during the instances that my cover was blown things did get a little bit fiddly once the firearms were drawn. I suspect there would have been a bit more precision offered with mouse and keyboard, but with a controller I found it overly fussy to get a bead on an enemy’s bonce using the lasersight, and more often than not resorted to hammering the melee attack and dodge move to chip away at their health bars in close quarters. Thankfully I was at least able to make good use of the ability to pause the action and direct my squadmates to focus on certain targets – reminiscent of similar systems in Wasteland or Mutant Year Zero – relying on them to wear down the beefier cult leaders while I mopped up the flamethrower-toting support crew. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a hard day’s mutant-murdering and loot-harvesting out in its deadly badlands, Survive the Fall shifts gears into a base-building management sim back at your camp. Documents recovered out in the world can be researched in order to earn knowledge points, which can then be invested in a sizable technology tree to unlock the ability to craft everything from bunk beds and kitchen areas to water filtration systems or even an armoury. Resources like timber can be crafted into planks which are then assembled into frames for new structures like plant boxes or gates to block nighttime raiders, while foraged herbs or meat salvaged from wolves and deer can be prepared into meals and stuffed into the backpacks of whichever group of adventurers you choose to send out on your next expedition. There seems to be quite a lot of depth here, and I can definitely see myself spending a considerable amount of time transforming my settlement from rusty rubble to cozy bubble in the finished game.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of my own base I found a number of intriguing areas to explore. From a crashed passenger plane that had been converted into an enemy fort to a farmstead that was crawling with Stasis-infected ghouls, Survive the Fall seemed to reward me with distinct locales in any direction I pointed my compass in. The impressive level of detail in some of these areas was also to its detriment, however, such as the swamplands of Mycorrhiza which dazzled with luminescent mushroom clusters but also dragged with a framerate that was more volatile than any of the toxic substances oozing from the earth. It was also plagued by the occasional game-breaking bug, and on a handful of occasions during my play session I was forced to quit and reload my save after getting stuck in an inventory screen or building menu. Thankfully there’s still another month or so before Survive the Fall’s release for developer Angry Bulls Studio to optimise the performance further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Survive the Fall seemed to reward me with distinct locales in any direction I pointed my compass in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s probably not quite enough time to draft in actors to record lines of dialogue, though, and that’s a slight shame because interacting with your squad or the various NPCs you meet along the way feels a little flat when it’s done exclusively via onscreen text. Although I did get a few laughs out of the odd character here and there – particularly from a quirky character named Blooper who referred to the Stasis smog as “fart wind” – much of my conversations just served to cue up the next fetch quest rather than really give me any lasting impressions of each faction member I met.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the bonds will deepen over the course of the full journey, and we won’t have to wait long to find out. Survive the Fall is due for release on PC this May and it’s full of post-apocalyptic potential. Assuming that the existing rough edges found on its controls and performance can be polished up by then this could well be a survival-based action RPG worthy of your hard-earned bottlecaps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor based in IGN's Sydney office.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launched on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC three weeks ago, and according to data from Circana, it has been the best-selling game in the US each of those weeks.</p>
<p>Executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana Mat Piscatella took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24">BlueSky</a> on Monday and announced that Shadows has stayed in the top spot for weekly game sales in the United States since it launched on March 20, 2025.</p>
<p>Piscatella also confirmed that Assassin's Creed Shadows is now the second-best-selling game in the United States for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's smash success to start the year, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>"<em>Here's a fun one...Assassin's Creed: Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market, according to Circana's Retail Tracking Service (dollar sales, latest data through April 5th)</em>," Piscatella wrote on BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em>Currently ranks #2 year-to-date trailing only Monster Hunter: Wilds</em>."</p>
<p>Just two days after launching, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed Shadows had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/">surpassed 2 million players worldwide</a>&nbsp;after it broke <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/">one million copies sold</a> on launch day. A week after it launched, Ubisoft confirmed it had gone even further and blown past <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/">3 million players</a>.</p>
<p>These milestones and financial achievements are enormous wins for Ubisoft, a company that desperately needed a win after 2024 was filled with major financial misses. Both of Ubisoft's big-budget games for 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>,&nbsp;missed the mark in several ways, including commercially, which made the cloud above the company only grow darker&nbsp;as more and more pressure weighed on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows success.</p>
<p>Ubisoft recently underwent a significant structural change, with its biggest series, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, all being moved to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/"> a new subsidiary</a> in which Tencent is a minority partner.</p>
<p>Plans for this new subsidiary are still unclear, with a<a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/"> recently leaked internal memo</a> including hints that layoffs could still very well be coming as the company adjusts to its new structure. We can only hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows's major success helps alleviate some of the losses, should they still occur.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/white-knuckle-has-you-falling-from-cloud-9.1163961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that defines the roguelite genre, it’s ascension. Climbing a peak until something – and almost always something unexpected – knocks you back down to the bottom of the mountain. It’s never going to be a breeze, but it’s worth it to know that the wind at the top is going to feel so much better. <em>White Knuckle</em> takes this sentiment to a literal extreme and then some.</p>

<p>This is the debut title from Dark Machine Games, a first-person roguelite parkour platformer, and published by DreadXP, who have been on a tear in the indie horror scene for quite a while now. From the jumpscare jamboree of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortuary-assistant" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a> to the downright inspiring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dread-delusion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, if there’s a forefront, DreadXP are standing there with arms wide open. As it stands, sprints, and springs, <em>White Knuckle</em> is a definitive example of that.</p>

<p>You play as a disembodied pair of hands, stranded at the bottom of a brutalist spire. An autonomous female voice occasionally spouts warnings and staff updates from the intercom, but beneath her announcements, and your own feet, something is bubbling below you and rising up. You’re tasked with climbing this seemingly endless tower to freedom, before you fall victim to the horrors of this facility’s work.</p>



<p>Even in this primitive state of “Early Access”, what’s fascinating to me about <em>White Knuckle</em> is how emboldened it is with crafting an identity for itself. It doesn’t take long for the core, or rather, cores, to open up layer by layer as time goes by, which is admirable, if a little bit foolishly noble for something so eager to make a statement.</p>

<p>It starts off as a goofy precision platformer in first person, like if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow"><em>Human Fall Flat</em></a> was in VR, where you control your jerky hands and elastic physical movement with the mouse buttons. How big your hitbox is exactly isn’t known, but that seems to add to the general fun of figuring out how you can cheese the climbing system.</p>

<p>One of <em>White Knuckle</em>’s sneaky assets is the inventory system, which is populated over time with pitons you can hammer into the wall to create new routes, weapons, and temporary health buffs. There is a limit to how much you can carry, but for better or worse, the game is reluctant to portray this information, or indeed, any information necessary to retain. With how stripped-down the game is, GUI-wise, it’s exceptionally difficult to figure out what your buffs are doing, even when they’re unlocked for further use.</p>



<p>Then there’s the aesthetic itself, remarkably cold concrete that only becomes colder as it’s smothered in brutalist architecture and PSX-style dithering. It’s not exactly retro, it’s more that it’s lending itself to how direct and suffocating this Soviet-era construction could be, alongside the generic announcements that pertain to employee retention and on-site alerts of failing power units. However, it won’t be long before the voice gives you a fairly direct warning: “It is below you”.</p>

<p>Now the horror kicks into gear, and indeed, the mass underneath you slowly rising up, sludge spitting out to stick to your boots is a threat, and you’re on a timer. You can’t sit there and strategize, this thing is constantly climbing, the same as you, and you’ve gotta pray that you can close the door behind you. You can take minor breaks in interludes that serve as vending machines for equipment, enhancements and extra lives, and this is where the roguelite elements come into play.</p>

<p>Despite this four-piece matinee of mechanics and design trying their best to work in tandem with each other, something still isn’t right. There’s another piece to the puzzle that was exceptionally difficult to ascertain as I threw myself through the monkey bars and motions that <em>White Knuckle</em> presents. It’s not just that the game feels unfocused, but there’s an element in play that’s actively sabotaging the rest of it quite successfully.</p>



<p>Indeed, I kept pushing further, looking for answers when and where I could. In time, I discovered small narrative snippets that present themselves in brief glimpses of the facility’s history and encounters with remnants of individuals designated to the same fate as you. I couldn’t ruminate on them for long, or indeed, at all, because I was on the clock, and there was a good chance I’d lose it if I didn’t make it up in time, which happened a lot, to my rage-fueled chagrin – and that’s when it hit me.</p>

<p>You can point to any number of influences <em>White Knuckle</em> wears as a pinstripe suit, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/portal-2-tale-of-two-female-icons" rel="nofollow">Portal</a> </em>to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/half-life-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a> – hell, even <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/infra" rel="nofollow">INFRA</a> </em>– but one thing that shines through more than anything else is its synonymy with rage-bait platformers, your <em>QWOP</em>s and your <em>Getting Over It</em>’s. This, in turn, seeks to dismantle the outrageous amount of promise White Knuckle inhibits, to the point where every other core is actively sabotaged by one another.</p>

<p>The roguelite elements tend to be undermined by how linear the platforming elements have to be, lest you’re softlocked by a lack of resources, which happens more often than you’d think. <em>White Knuckle</em>'s extra lives system works as such: If you die after using one, you’ll spawn back at the computer you used the floppy disk on, BUT, you lose your entire inventory upon death unless you acquire a perk, and if you can’t find a piton or rebar rod before you come across something which requires it, you can only jump against the wall and await death.</p>



<p>The progression system is undermined by the sheer reluctance <em>White Knuckle</em> shows when trying to convey information, largely reducing the player’s power to contextless icons and minor screen flashes. What’s the difference between the effect of a syringe, and the effect of a medicine bottle? Who knows! One flashes red, and the other flashes blue, but you’ll be damned to the goo before the game tells you what it’ll do!</p>

<h2><em>White Knuckle</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Fear is replaced by frustration, and discovery is replaced by dismissal. In its current state, <em>White Knuckle</em> isn’t a well-oiled machine juggling its various gameplay features, it’s the Olympic logo warped to “OOOOO”. Thankfully, this infancy can be nothing but a learning curve, as despite so much vigor in their chest, and pep in their step, <em>White Knuckle</em> has been summoned in a disillusioned state that doesn't know where to jump to.</p>

In this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review, I'll go over my experience traveling above a ruined Earth, warts and all.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="670cb0ae-b83d-4879-95e2-a5fc28b63dc2" href="https://techraptor.net/games/forever-skies" rel="nofollow"><em>Forever Skies</em></a>&nbsp;takes place on a futuristic Earth that has been overrun by the "Dust", an amalgamation of mutated flora and fauna that has rendered the surface toxic and uninhabitable. This has also caused the birth of new diseases, including the "Grey Plague", a terrible malady that is bringing humanity to the brink of extinction — and now, it's up to you to cure it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=ZTVpwddb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=MuhUbXWN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're anything like me, you'll likely spend a few hours in the early game collecting crafting materials so you can build out your airship.</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking to the Skies</h2>

<p>Your adventure begins after emerging from a drop pod that descended from the <em>Ark</em>, a space station that is home to the handful of humans who have escaped Earth entirely. The Grey Plague is slowly killing them, and you are their only hope to fix it. But first, you'll have to get on your feet.</p>

<p>As with many survival games,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;starts you off on a tutorial tower where you learn the basics of the game on foot. You'll assemble a basic Airship toward the end of this tutorial zone and take to the skies in search of answers and valuable crafting materials.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>, your Airship is both your means of transportation and your base. You'll only have a small airship with one balloon and one engine at the beginning; eventually, you could build it out to a multi-level leviathan with multiple balloons, engines, turbines, and automated turrets that collect debris to fuel your crafting.</p>

<p>You'll be limited to a handful of different types of towers in the early hours of the game. Adding some turbines and unlocking key crafting recipes will let you access taller buildings and open up new areas of the map. Eventually, though, you'll have to descend below the surface.</p>

<p>The early parts of&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em> are all about landing at towers to get the raw materials you need for your airship. Your main concerns will be keeping up your survival stats, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">building your airship</a>, and avoiding falling off a tower into the ground below. Eventually, the story will take you to your first underground area in the "Underdust."</p>

<p>The surface of Earth is a very different beast. The air is totally unbreathable, and you'll need to rely on a small oxygen tank to survive, supplemented by oxygen stations throughout the Underdust that you'll have to power up.</p>

<p>Early Underdust areas won't have much in the way of hazards save for the oxygen limit and the occasional harmful flora. Later areas, though, will have you fighting against actual enemies. Combat isn't all that difficult, especially when you're using a ranged weapon.</p>

<p>The Underdust is often home to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a>&nbsp;that can't reliably be found elsewhere, such as Crystals, as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed3c7773-13d3-4637-9df8-7dc7ad9cce99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-trading-guide-how-to-buy-and-sell-items" rel="nofollow">trading kiosks</a>. Although you only need to visit each of these dangerous locations once, you'll often find yourself returning to them multiple times to fuel <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7e81d8e6-64ca-49e2-8cf2-d6225e3a402f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-crafting-and-unlocks-guide" rel="nofollow">your crafting</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">Airship building</a> — all the more so when you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="995f762e-ef6c-4c8d-92de-c850561bfa1d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">playing multiplayer</a>.</p>

<p>The Underdust is indeed filled with mystery, but it presents another problem — these handcrafted story locations often tanked my framerate.</p>

<p>The PC I used to play the 1.0 beta version exceeded the recommended requirements on the Steam page on every metric — I have a much better processor and graphics card, and more than enough RAM. For some reason I don't understand, however, my framerate would randomly drop to 10 FPS or worse in many of these Underdust areas.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon happened with bad weather. Whenever it rained, my framerate would go right into the gutter. Saving and restarting the game seemed to help, so my gut tells me that there may be a memory leak or some other unresolved optimization issue.</p>

<p>I was not alone, either; I spent some of my time playing in multiplayer with my girlfriend and a good friend. The three of us all met the minimum and recommended requirements, but our framerate would go to hell in the Underdust, and while it was raining.</p>

<p>This wasn't the only performance issue I encountered, mind; at a certain point, adding or removing pieces from your Airship caused the game to freeze for a moment. As with most survival games, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;gets a little bit laggy when you start building big.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=_8tHK0_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=y31_n3mV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're freaked out by bugs, you might want to avoid&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>...</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'll close out this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review with an inevitable comparison: yes,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;feels a lot like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="43038c34-13cb-4306-a71a-537928a67c0a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/raft" rel="nofollow"><em>Raft</em></a>. You take your base with you, going from story location to story location and stopping at smaller points of interest along the way to collect <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and decorations for your ship.</p>

<p>If you (and your friends) enjoyed<i>&nbsp;Raft</i>, you'll find a lot to love in&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>. If you've never played a game like this before, the sci-fi setting and light first-person shooter elements may be easier for you to pick up than the coconut technology found in&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>.</p>

<p><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;is a fine game in its own right, and Far From Home may very well deliver some excellent post-launch content. However, all of this great game design and fun exploration is hampered by performance issues that should have been sorted out before launching a 1.0 version; one hopes that the developers will fix these problems sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911811628124742117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Respawn's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-completes-acquisition-of-respawn-entertainment" rel="nofollow">parent company</a> EA invites players to "engage in turn-based tactical combat" with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>&nbsp;and confirms that the game will be revealed in full during the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>celebration on Saturday, April 19th.</p>

<p>There, a panel will be held involving Bit Reactor, Respawn, and Lucasfilm Games, during which "a world-exclusive first look" at&nbsp;<em>Zero Company&nbsp;</em>will be shared. Not much more information than that is available right now, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xcom-bit-reactor-star-wars-zero-company.jpg?itok=8HORDqWu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xcom-bit-reactor-star-wars-zero-company.jpg?itok=t4F6GdUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>'s developers previously worked on franchises like&nbsp;<em>XCOM</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer behind&nbsp;<em>Zero Company</em>, Bit Reactor, counts veterans from&nbsp;<em>XCOM&nbsp;</em>and <i>Civilization&nbsp;</i>studio Firaxis Games among its number. Founded back in 2022, the studio was first revealed to be working on a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game alongside Respawn <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-respawn-star-wars-games-in-works" rel="nofollow">in January that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, it's been a bit of a rocky road for Respawn; one of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>games, an FPS being worked on by Respawn exec Peter Hirschmann, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">canceled back in February last year</a>, which is also when around 5% of EA employees were laid off.</p>

<p>As part of that layoff wave, Respawn employees working on the battle royale hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">were let go</a>, leaving the future of Respawn's tactical&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game in question.</p>

<p>Happily, it seems that the game was still being worked on all this time, and a full reveal is scheduled for the weekend. If you've been clamoring for something a little different from the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>property, this might well be it.</p>

<p>We'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company&nbsp;</em>on Saturday, when it'll be revealed in full. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And yes, you’ll be absolutely correct to notice that it’s so far missing the two most important Pokémon species, Mimikyu and Mantine. But given there’s not even a Snorlax, perhaps like so many other ranges on the store, there will be more added as time goes on. Or perhaps not...</p><p>So far the releases have mostly focused on all the starters, including of course Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur, with a bonus addition of Pikachu and Mew. The range is called “Adventure Partners Plush Key Chain,” suggesting that maybe it’ll be more limited. But that doesn’t really explain the Eeveelutions or Mew. But, with every starter present, that means there will be at least one everyone loves, and then also Chimchar and Popplio.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4415be2c08ea24746073f6b1e396d6a8"

<p>Star Wars Zero Company will receive an official “world exclusive first look” on April 19 through a panel with Bit Reactor, Respawn, and LucasFilm Games.</p>



<p>Star Wars Zero Company is an upcoming single-player turn-based tactics game that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>earlier last month. The official reveal will be live-streamed from a ‘Galaxy Stage’ on April 19 as part of the Star Wars Celebration event. Respawn will produce the title, while Bit Reactor will lead the game’s development. Star Wars Zero Company will be <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911816230908121249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on</a> PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-star-wars-zero-company-about">What is Star Wars Zero Company About?</h2>



<p>Not much has been officially revealed about the game besides its title and genre; however, some details have surfaced early through leaks. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from March, early images of the game showed gameplay reminiscent of popular tactical turn-based games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2. We also saw a Mandalorian character fighting against a Storm Trooper, with the bottom screen showing the actions a player can take in this situation.</p>



<p>However, the screenshots were from an earlier game build and are subject to change or removal with the final build. The only way to know what Star Wars Zero Company is about is by tuning in for the official reveal on April 19, where we might get to see some gameplay and hopefully a release date, too.</p>



<p>In other news, Star Wars: Hunters will shut down<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in October 2025</a>. The Star Wars Eclipse developer was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by NetEase’s restructuring</a>.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is continuing to be a successful launch for Ubisoft amid all of the company uncertainty. According to the latest information from Circana, the game is one of the best-selling games in the United States (US) so far this year.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> on Monday, Circana’s Mat Piscatella revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US in each of its first three weeks on the market in terms of dollar sales. </p>



<p>It was added that it’s the second-best-selling game year-to-date trailing on Monster Hunter: Wilds. Monster Hunter: Wilds released just about three weeks—February 28—before Assassin’s Creed Shadows did on March 20.</p>

<p>Though specific numbers haven’t been revealed by Circana, Ubisoft has said publicly that more than 3 million players have played the game as of its first week. That number, however, is likely to include those who received a copy from Ubisoft or are subscribers to Ubisoft+. It’s unsure, as of publishing, what the official units sold count is for the game as it reaches a month on the market. </p>



<p>That information is likely to come at or around the time Ubisoft holds its next earnings call on May 14.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows being at the top of the sales charts in the US since its release? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <p>
EA's Star Wars strategy game, confirmed to be in the works back in 2022, has been given a title - Star Wars: Zero Company - and a first bit of artwork ahead of a full reveal this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
Little has been heard about Bit Reactor's game in the years since its announcement - although the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">studio did break its silence</a> to confirm the project had been unaffected by the EA layoffs that accompanied the end of Respawn's shooter - but all that's about to change.
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
EA has <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911811628124742117">taken to social media</a> to share the first official details about the project, calling Star Wars: Zero Company a "single-player turn-based tactics game", and sharing a first bit of concept art. The image features a motley crew of unnamed characters (plus one luxuriant moustache) including a Jedi, Mandalorian, and Clone trooper - with the latter suggesting Zero Company is set in the prequel era. That's further supported by the appearance of a battle droid displayed on the holographic device held by our moustachioed friend.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there's not much more to report - but that will change this weekend as part of 2025's Star Wars Celebration convention. EA says it'll be sharing a "world-exclusive first look" at Zero Company as part of panel this Saturday, 19th June. Expect those details to start working their way across the internet shortly after.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/marathon-will-be-a-premium-title-but-it-wont-be-full-priced/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/marathon-will-be-a-premium-title-but-it-wont-be-full-priced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> will not be a free-to-play game, but it also won’t be a ‘full-priced’ title, the company has said. How much will it cost, though? Well, you’ll have to wait until the summer to find out.</p>
<p>Responding to a erroneous quote pulled from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/">now amended Gamespot article</a> with details on the game, the Marathon social media account states, “Marathon will be a premium title. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title.”</p>



<p>The implication is that the game will not be priced at the now expected $70 price point, but will come in somewhere lower, similar to other Sony game releases over the last year, where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> were both $40 games. Of course, those games were literal polar opposites in terms of how well that worked out, and there’s been a fairly negative view of what Bungie revealed over the weekend for Marathon.</p>
<p>As was showcased during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">gameplay reveal</a> over the weekend, Marathon will take the extraction shooter template – teams of players will drop into maps on the planet of Tau Ceti IV, look to scavenge resources and complete objectives against AI enemies, survive encounters with other teams of players, and extract or die trying (and lose everything you’re holding – and seek to spin it out into another broad live service shooter with battle passes, an overarching narrative and more.</p>

<p>For Destiny fans looking for a new fix, that is a huge change of pace to what’s on offer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, where everything is delineated between PvE spaces and missions and PvP. It’s also fair to expect that the story being told will likely have the feel of how narratives are threaded through seasons of Apex Legends and Fortnite – again, comparisons to Helldivers 2 with its cooperative community goals and Concord with its plan for weekly character-building cinematics will be made as more about Marathon is revealed.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of doubters out there, but if there’s one thing that Bungie knows how to do, it’s make great-feeling first person shooters, and Marathon has all the potential to be exactly that, adapted to another fresh setting for the studio.</p>
<p>Marathon is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set to launch on 23rd September. A closed alpha test is coming later this month.</p>

			<p>This coming Saturday, April 19, 2025, EA and Bit Reactor will reveal the previously announced single-player Star Wars turn-based tactics game, which we now know is officially titled Star Wars Zero Company.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company was one of EA's last few remaining Star Wars games after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/">unannounced shooter from Respawn</a> was canceled earlier this year. We're also still waiting for news on the third installment in Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series, though that seems to be further off considering Star Wars Jedi: Survivor only released two years ago now.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company will be showcased during the Star Wars Celebration this weekend. The celebration officially kicks off on Friday, April 18, and runs until Sunday, April 20. Zero Company will be unveiled during a <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/en-us/explore-the-event/panels.html#/event/bit-reactor-developer-panel-featuring-respawn-entertainment-and-lucasfilm-games">one-hour panel</a> with EA, Respawn,&nbsp;and Bit Reactor that will kick off at <strong>1:30 pm PT /4:30 pm ET/9:30 pm BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of a turn-based tactics game set in the Star Wars universe has had many speculating that this will be a Star Wars-skinned take on XCOM, though this coming Saturday's reveal will be the first time we see if that's the case or not.</p>
<p>At the very least, Star Wars Zero Company will be a different kind of Star Wars game than we've been getting in recent years. Star Wars Outlaws might not have featured any Jedi, but it was still a third-person action-adventure game, like Respawn's Jedi series. As far as other different or new Star Wars games are concerned, we're still waiting to hear about Star Wars Eclipse, which seems to be delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/">beyond 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, if that even is still in production.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-is-what-all-sports-games-should-be-its-just-fun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Though I was only able to play for a few hours during my limited time with the game, one thought kept coming back to me while I was playing Rematch: this game is really fun.</p>



<p>Rematch is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-is-a-new-soccer-game-from-sifu-developer-sloclap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming online soccer title</a> from Sloclap, the developers of Sifu. Featuring 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 online matches, players control their individual player on the pitch. Think of it as Rocket League but for the actual sport it’s based on.</p>



<p>You can control your player either using mouse and keyboard or controller. I attempted to use both, but found a few bugs with the mouse controls that left me going back to the controller for most of my time. The bugs, like not being able to fully turn the camera with a mouse, I expect to be flushed out in future betas and with the full release on June 19.</p>



<p>In the beta that I had access to over the weekend, we were able to play 4v4 and 5v5 matches, private games, and see some of the customization options. The customization options are a solid way to differentiate your player on the field, but it’s not something I care too much about, personally, with games like this so I didn’t spend too much time see what was there. One thing I did notice with the customization, however, is the ability to have prosthetic arms or legs. It’s a nice little touch that is sure to make those with prosthetics feel seen from a genre that they may not normally go to those lengths.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fast-paced-gameplay-of-rematch">The Fast-Paced Gameplay of Rematch</h2>



<p>On the field is where you see everything with Rematch come together. The field size changes based on the team sizes, and the environments of the fields are unique and just make the game feel special. </p>



<p>From the fluidity of your player’s movement to the responsiveness of the controls and everything in between, everything feels polished. Even in a beta state, there weren’t really any moments where I felt like my player didn’t do what I had intended or what I felt it should’ve done. </p>



<p>Within the action, everything is manual and skill based. Your passes and shots go where you aim them, and you need to get to the ball in order to gain possession. It’s not going to stick to your feet if you are somewhat close, which makes your positioning and attack all that more important. You also have to decide how you want to hit the ball when you have possession. There are light, medium, and high-powered hits that are used for passes, lobs, clearances, and shots. The most difficult part when learning Rematch is aiming your shot or pass while trying to get the right spin and power behind it. It’s a lot at one time to get, but once you get the hang of it, it feels incredible to pull off. </p>



<p>When you can’t make the shot or pass you want, however, you could find yourself creating your own meme-worthy moments like smacking the ball along the wall over…and over…and over again. </p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Slidetackle.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>There are even various dribble moves that are easy to learn but require the right timing to master and get around a defender. A mistimed flick of the ball will lead to a scoring opportunity the other way and a team of players wishing they can call you names in the chat—luckily, they can’t. But there is in-game voice communication that, at least for this, was far more pleasant than any other online game I’ve been a part of.</p>



<p>There are no fouls, offsides, and the ball just bounces off the wall rather than go out of bonds. It’s all designed to keep the action going and the play hectic. And it works beautifully. Playing defense is just as rewarding as offense, especially with a well-timed slide tackle to break up a play.</p>



<p>Lastly, Sloclap has managed to make playing goalkeeper fun without being intimidating. When in goal, you simply need to stay in position and time your save attempts in order to keep the ball out of the net. Some shots you just won’t have a chance to stop while others will have you making a save that even you can’t believe you pulled off.</p>



<p>As I said earlier, it’s just fun. </p>



<h2 id="h-teamwork-is-key">Teamwork Is Key</h2>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goal.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Aside from how <em>you </em>play and control your own player, how you play as a team is key to finding any sort of success on the field. If you go into a game of Rematch thinking you are going to be a Leo Messi against a bunch of children and dominate everyone, you’re going to immediately be humbled. Trying to solo everything will lead to goals against and a team that will just exclude you from play. It’s not a fun way to enjoy the game and will lead to more losses.</p>



<p>Timing passes properly, finding the gaps in coverage, and finding open teammates on a run will serve you better than any other strategy you can think of. Hell, there were even games where my team decided to dedicate ourselves to specific positions for an entire game, and it resulted in a crisp game where we controlled the ball for what fell like all but 30 seconds.</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-final-thoughts">Rematch Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>In Rematch, every match feels different even if you’re playing with the same teammates. With each game you find yourself getting better and better with a willingness to try more outlandish play ideas or shot attempts. Whether you want to try an intentional pass off the wall above the goal or make a pass to yourself off the side wall, the thrill off successfully pulling off these moves is something that other sports games rarely replicate. </p>



<p>Obviously with this being a beta, I can’t give a full review on Rematch and what Sloclap has to offer. But what I can say is that if what I was able to play is any indication, Rematch is looking like a strong contender for sports game of the year for 2025.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty developer Pete Actipis, who is the game director on CoD: Warzone at Raven Software, has teased Activision's plans for the OG map, Verdansk, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/" data-ref-id="2900-6387">just recently returned to the game</a>.</p><p>As many may recall, Warzone's original battle royale map was featured in the game from launch in March 2020 to December 2021. It was gone for years until its return earlier this month. Actipis told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Activision "brought Verdansk back for a reason."</p><p>"It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it," Actipis said. "So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there."</p><p>Actipis declined to get into specifics on Activision's plans and strategy for Warzone map rotation, but the developer did tease, "We love Verdansk."</p><p>Actipis added: "It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1170698227"

data-ref-id="1100-6530610">helped the game's player populations grow on Steam</a>. Actipis said the return of Verdansk has been "pretty successful" so far. Actipis pointed to Warzone having positive sentiment on Reddit as an example of how the company has turned things around to a degree at least.</p><p>"Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it," Actipis said. "We recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going."</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall. For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">Black Ops 6 was 2024's best-selling game in the US.</a></p>

                <p>The Advance Wars lookalike tactics game Warside, developed by Lavabird and published by First Break Labs, is out now on PC. However, fans have pointed out that it's buggy and seemingly unfinished, reflecting its Mostly Negative reception so far.</p><p>Warside looks eerily similar, if not almost identical, to Advance Wars. The maps, buildings, battles, and troops look very much like the ones in Nintendo's tactics franchise. The biggest differentiator is that the Commanders in Warside have a more realistic pixel art as opposed to Advance Wars' anime art style.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews section</a>, there are several features and gameplay mechanics that are missing. One player said that Warside feels like an early access release, with multiplayer lobbies and local multiplayer functionality nowhere to be found, even though both features were advertised as available.</p><p>Another player noted that the game's economy is broken as income needed to purchase troops is unavailable. However, it seems like the developers have already quickly fixed that issue.</p><p>Warside isn't the only game that's attempting to capture the spirit of the Game Boy Advance era, as the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-classic-fire-emblem-inspired-rpg-launches-in-march/1100-6529734/" data-ref-id="1100-6529734">Dark Deity 2</a> is inspired by Fire Emblem games from that period.</p><p>Warside currently has a 10% launch discount and will be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox at a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/warside-launches-april-14-for-pc-later-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later date</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-2033-redux-is-free-on-steam-gog-and-xbox-for-48-hours-to-celebrate-metro%E2%80%99s-15-year-anniversary.1163856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-redux-is-free-on-steam-gog-and-xbox-for-48-hours-to-celebrate-metros-15-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Metro series, developer 4A Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-legacy-an-upcoming-expansion-mod-shown-in-first-trailer/">Metro 2033 Redux</a> will be&nbsp;free for the next 48 hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a>, and Xbox.</p>
<p>A short clip of gameplay from Metro 2033 Redux announces the giveaway with a post on the series' official X account. The post showcases the definitive version of the first installment of the series, which launched back in 2010. Redux, the version that is free for players to grab, was released four years later, in 2014.</p>
<p>It's unclear why PlayStation players are left out of the loop or if they'll be included in a future giveaway. For now, though, you're better off running to one or all of the aforementioned digital storefronts to add a free copy of Metro 2033 Redux to your library.</p>
<p>The Metro series celebrated its actual 15-year anniversary on March 16, 2025, and at the time announced that there would be "<em>events, deals, and celebratory content</em>" posted throughout the year. In addition to getting Metro 2033 Redux for free, you can also get the rest of the series on sale on Steam and GOG. Though&nbsp;Metro 2033 Redux isn't available for free on PlayStation, it is heavily discounted, along with the other games in the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="15 Years Of Metro  -  Celebration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbADeT1-HLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metro 2033 Redux will take you back to the series' origins, but so will the most recent game in the Metro series, last year's prequel VR title <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/">Metro: Awakening</a>. But no new mainline entry has pushed the story forward in years.</p>
<p>Regarding what's next for the franchise, formally 4A Games Ukraine, now Reburn studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/4a-games-confirm-theyre-making-the-next-metro-with-dmitry-glukhovsky/">confirmed</a> that they are working on a new Metro game with the series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky. Still, there's been no news on this new title in some months. It'll be a while longer before we get any new word on how the title is progressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, grab Metro 2033 Redux for free while you can, especially if you missed it being free on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-and-metro-2033-redux-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Game Store</a> a few years ago.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>'s remake is near upon us, going by the Loud Noises online. Somebody's finally managed to get a response out of Bethesda regarding the much-tipped Oblivion comeback, and it is that special flavour of non-committal that attracts the true believers like wasps to a capsized icecream van. "We have no official information on an Oblivion remake," observed the company's Support staff in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1909296361503174761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1909296361503174761%7Ctwgr%5E874b2fca725c12b2e6308c72ab0ce2fe03d343f8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Foblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information%2F">response</a> to some nosy parker last week. "Apologies for any confusion."</p><!--more-->
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information/">The Gamer</a> for spotting the above. I've been avoiding a lot of the rumours because frankly, many of them read like people converting to <a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Unitology">Unitology</a> after stumbling on an extra-twisty Nik Nak. But there are now enough of them that I can mash them all together like I'm turning junk bonds into triple-A securities, and pass the results off as reporting. Seriously, though, there's quite a lot of smoke in the air. It feels increasingly like there's an announcement in the offing. Here's a quick round-up of the most substantial and/or recent pieces of gossip.</p>
<p>- Back in 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared</a> a 2020 planning document with details of several possible projects, including a new version of Oblivion.</p>
<p>- This January, MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">dug up a former Virtuos employee's CV</a> which makes mention of an Unreal Engine 5 Oblivion remake, detailing improvements to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking.</p>
<p>- But a few days ago, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game Of The Year Steam page <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/900883/history/">was updated</a> to remove some older trailers. Routine housekeeping?</p>
<p>- Jeff Grubb, a dependable disseminator of insider gossip, has claimed on Giant Bomb's 7th April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI">The Power Block</a> video that the reveal is definitely coming this month.</p>
<p>- <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">NateTheHate</a> claims the remake will be revealed <em>and</em> released this month, in comments green-ticked by <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1900289910801916177">Andy Robinson</a> of Vero Gusto Computing. Andy Robinson once beat me at Mortal Kombat in front of Netherrealm and I despise him to this day, but I have never known him to tell a fib about a video game.</p>
<p>If you're ambivalent about Oblivion, or disinclined to engage with anything Microsoft-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">in light of recent reporting</a>, you might prefer to check out certain community initiatives that take inspiration from Oblivion, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-gets-a-whole-gamejam-dedicated-to-persuasion-pie-co-hosted-by-a-dont-nod-developer">this persuasion-themed game jam</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jyh4fx/oblivion_remake_official_footage/?utm_name=web3xcss">this fun demake</a> co-starring Bethesda's indefatigable Adoring Fan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
