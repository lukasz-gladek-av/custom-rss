            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-pinball-game-announced-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> pinball machine is coming next year. Wizards of the Coast is extending the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG into the realm of old-school time wasters thanks to a deal with Stern Pinball.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Pinball Machine Announcement</h2>

<p>The official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> account announced the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine via a <a href="https://x.com/Wizards_DnD/status/1874138499051298872?t" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>The post contained little detail. It was a collection of eyeball emojis followed by a thirty-second teaser trailer. The trailer was barebones, showing illustrations of a dungeon, a battle map, a d20 being rolled, and a blink and you'll miss it face of a red dragon. The name of the pinball machine, <em>The Tyrant's Eye</em>, alongside this imagery strongly implies the machine will involve toppling a red dragon tyrant.</p>

First, there is a limited supply of these pinball machines. Second, the machines will only be shipping to the mainland United States. Sorry, EU and UK fans. Third, purchases of these pinball machines will only be available to All-Access Stern Insider members.</p>

<p>As for the price for one of these maines? The Pro and Premium editions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> pinball machines will be sold at an MSRP of $6,999. Furthermore, there is a Limited Edition machine available for $12,999.</p>

<p>This does beg the question as to what these pinball machines contain. What novelty will they bring to the game of pinball? Will certain creatures and characters be showcased like the conniving Xanathar or the magnficent Mordenkainen? Those details will be revealed by Stern on January 3.</p>

<p>The release of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine is a natural extension of the game's growing popularity. One that has surged thanks to the rise of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-10-year-anniversary-live-show-announced-includes-fjord-and-jester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> alongside the critical and commercial success of Larian Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earth Defense Force 6 is the pinnacle of a series that many people view as being a fairly mindless shooter. Despite that, it also has the best use and interpretation of time travel of any game I've played. It does that without leveraging new-fangled fancy graphics, instead relying on quality storytelling and some very cool meta decisions that change up the usual “just pick the next mission” grind that’s present in these games. EDF 6 uses all of these things to great effect, and it makes the time-travel concept almost feel believable.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Earth Defense Force 6 spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The fact that time travel is ingrained into basically every aspect of the story means that, while it's not as visually striking as the time travel offered in something like Dishonored or Titanfall, it's more engrossing. The way it's interwoven into the mechanics as well makes for an incredibly novel take on the concept I’ve not seen before, especially when it ends with somehow being more over-the-top than killing a god.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Future Is Filled With Bugs</h3><p dir="ltr">EDF 6 kicks off a few years after the end of EDF 5, when the Primers wiped out the majority of humanity. Despite the fact that you manage to kill what might be a god, humans still have to escape underground to try to survive against the alien menace.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is that, at the start of EDF 6, you shoot a bunch of giant frogs with guns. You shoot them with guns, but they also have guns--you follow? These are older versions of the same foes from EDF 5, but they don't move like they want to fight: They move like they're sick of this never-ending war. Nevertheless, you fight them off, and after a few levels, see a brand-new ship that opens up a strange portal.</p><p dir="ltr">You then watch a bunch of other new ships go into the portal with no idea of what's going on. You find a weak spot on this strange vessel, and after shooting it, everything fades to white, as you get welcomed to EDF 6. This is where you're booted back to levels from EDF 5, and boy howdy, is that wild.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416859"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Another One</h3><p dir="ltr">You eventually find yourself in the future once more, but things are a bit different. Terraformers darken the skyline, and new enemy types have appeared, but how can this be possible if this is just a loop? Well, guess what: You fight for a bit, find the same portal ship, destroy it, and are welcomed to EDF 7. This loop continues until you hit EDF 9.</p><p dir="ltr">It sounds like that should be arduous, but each time, EDF throws a new load of missions at you, with some being brand new, and some being slight tweaks on missions from EDF 5, but with subtle changes to allude to the time-travel storyline. The missions you tend to actually replay-- the futuristic ones--also come with small tweaks. Sometimes that's new enemies, and sometimes it's something in the background. Most importantly, though, you and the one scientist who knows what's going on are always aware of these loops, and you're learning, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Through repetition and study, the scientist concludes that time travel is happening and convinces the world of this fact. How do you fight against a foe that can keep traveling back in time and, more importantly, one who can keep upgrading their tech as well? This isn't a loop; it's an endless spiral of an arms race where neither side can actually win. How did this begin anyway?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416860"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Time Travel Is The New Meta</h3><p dir="ltr">This segment covers the first 132 levels, which are, thankfully, far better-paced than that of any other game in the series, and all of them contribute to the strange feeling you and the characters will have about the whole time-travel aspect. This is where EDF 6 does something truly incredible: It temporarily stops giving you new levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, that's what it looks like, anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">EDF 6 has six mystery missions marked with ??? in your missions list for you to stumble upon as you're trying to figure out what's happening. Each of these represents a key victory that you haven't managed in any timeline. Maybe you rescue someone who's always died otherwise; maybe you find a way to destroy a specific ship earlier than usual. Once you've completed them all, you get to the final version of the future, and that's where the concept goes from well-done to awe-inspiring.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416861"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">The End Is The Beginning</h3><p dir="ltr">The first major event in this final future is that you once again find the portal ship, but upon destroying the control unit this time, the ship itself isn’t destroyed. You aren't hurled back through time, either. Instead, the portal remains open, and enormous tentacles and turrets start to come out of it to kill you and the remainder of the EDF. Things are different this time, but you find two new weaknesses on this ship and destroy it. The war is won, yay! Well, no.</p><p dir="ltr">An entirely new portal opens above you, and an enormous flying metal dragon emerges. It's hard to describe just how large this thing is, but fighting it involves consistently leading your shots because the sheer scale of your foe makes it hard to target. The game states it's over 1km in length, and it feels it. It turns out this is the newly upgraded version of the portal ship, but one from several centuries in the future, because the Primers you're fighting have all the time in the world to keep upgrading their tech and sending it back.</p><p dir="ltr">After a long fight, you seemingly destroy this ship, only to see that the head of it has been replaced by the final boss from EDF 5: a godlike being with the power to alter reality and create life from nothing. As you continue to fight, you learn that the EDF has discovered these aliens come from Mars. They launch a rocket at the planet to try to destroy them at their source--the present--even though you're fighting a version of them from the future. You can't read that and tell me it's anything less than incredible, and it gets better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416862" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416862"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Timey-Wimey, But With Ants And Gods</h3><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the Primers started attacking Earth because of this missile, but you only ever sent this missile because they attacked Earth. This, dear readers, is a paradox, and that's not great for any timeline. Gameplay-wise, you just keep fighting until you've won, but the way the game justifies this confusing loop is far cooler.</p><p dir="ltr">The scientist explains that this paradox has to be righted, because if it exists, then all timelines might collapse. The paradox will, as a result, simply choose a victor. Your aim is to weaken the Primers and their god to the point where they are the logical choice as the loser, and as you keep fighting, you eventually tip the scales out of balance and into the favor of humanity. The timeline erases the Primers entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Earth still suffered losses, but now, society gets to prosper with tech that's been through multiple timelines and create a proper utopia. Why isn't all of that removed from reality entirely? I've no idea, but there's simply no other game that makes time travel feel as much a part of its DNA as the actual gameplay. Earth Defense Force 6 one-ups killing a god by having you kill a time paradox, and that's metal as all hell.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>That concludes the 2024 Steam Awards, and these are all of the winners across each category. It's no surprise that Black Myth: Wukong has swept up a ton of awards, especially considering how well they've done for themselves in every other ceremony despite being a widely controversial game.</p>
<p>There are some surprising winners on this list, with games like Red Dead Redemption taking the best soundtrack when games such as Silent Hill 2 and Horizon Forbidden West were competitors in that category. However, Silent Hill 2 did net one award for the best visual style.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of Balatro and the fact that the game was nominated in multiple categories, it didn't win any awards at this particular ceremony. However, it has been successful in other ceremonies, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards</a>, where it picked up a couple of awards and was even nominated for Game of the Year.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this year's winners of the Steam Awards 2024?</p>

<p>The next 12 months are shaping up to be some of the best for Microsoft and the Xbox Series X|S systems since they launched in 2020. While there have been some great games over the last four years — Forza Horizon 5 and STALKER 2, just to name a couple —  for the latest Microsoft consoles, it’s been a bit hit or miss for the most part of this generation. In 2025, that appears to be changing. So, let’s look at the biggest Xbox games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether it’s an Xbox exclusive or an anticipated multiplatform title, there’s no shortage of games coming that will leave you wondering how you are going to find the time (and money) for everything.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest PlayStation Games Coming in 2025</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-exclusives-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Exclusives Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-avowed">Avowed</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Avowed is the upcoming first-person RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment, set in the high-fantasy world of Eora, the same universe Pillars of Eternity. The game was originally scheduled to release in October 2024, but was pushed to February 18, 2025 by Xbox Game Studios in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order to let the game breath</a> more rather than releasing it so close to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>The game will feel familiar to fans of Skyrim and other fantasy RPGs, with various abilities and skills to help you experience the world how you like. For those concerned about the game being first-person, fear not. Avowed will have the option to play in third person. It will also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developers of We Happy Few and Contrast, South of Midnight takes players to the deep south of the United States. The game sees you play Hazel who becomes a Weaver after a storm hits her home of Prospero. According to Compulsion Games, a Weaver is a “magical  mender of broken bonds and spirits”. </p>



<p>“Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous creatures, untangle the webs of her own family’s shared past and -if she’s lucky – find her way to a place that feels like home,”  the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>No release date has been announced, but the game is planned to release in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Officially announced in 2020, Fable has been in development for nearly a decade. Not only is it the fourth main installment of the series, but it’s also serving as a reboot for the franchise.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a couple trailers</a> for the game so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">each more promising</a> than the last. The game also features Richard Ayoade as a giant who doesn’t seem too fond of the main character, or heroes in general.</p>



<p>Fable is scheduled for 2025 — rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have it scheduled for late 2025</a> — and will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A prequel set 14 years before the original game, Gears of War: E-Day centers around young versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. The game’s story — that we know so far — has players deal with the locust horde during Emergence Day. Not much else is known about the game’s features, but that should be coming over the coming months.</p>



<p>Gears of War: E-Day hasn’t been confirmed for a 2025 release, but <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1801291340569071619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest rumors</a> are pointing to the possibility. This is one Xbox exclusive, however, that could be come in 2026 instead.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-games-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-gta-6">Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Did you think this would be a list of biggest games and not include GTA 6? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated game of the year</a> — and likely the last decade or more — GTA 6 is currently planned for a 2025 despite countless rumors of an eventual delay to 2026.</p>



<p>It’s been nearly 12 years since the last game in the series was released, and, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-world-record-broken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer alone</a>, GTA 6 could go down as the biggest launch in video game history. The anticipation for the game isn’t just with fans, either. Even those in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">industry are making decisions</a> about their releases around what Rockstar decides to do</p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First revealed by Insider Gaming</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to 2016’s DOOM. A single-player game, DOOM: The Dark Ages “tells the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage.” According to developer id Software, the game sees you control DOOM Slayer as he tries to protect a kingdom against the demons from Hell.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the game at the moment, but that should be coming over the next few months. And for those on PlayStation 5 who were worried about not getting the next DOOM game, it should be noted that the game will launch on PS5 the same day.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game from Obsidian Entertainment coming in 2025, The Outer Worlds 2 was first announced at E3 2021. At the time, the developers bluntly stated that there was nothing else ready to be shown to players. Three years later, and fans got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a> along with a confirmed 2025 release window.</p>



<p>The game took “three times longer to make” and will be at least “two times bigger” according to the fun gameplay reveal trailer. Like the first, The Outer Worlds 2 will be a first-person RPG that takes players to the new Arcadia colony where a factional war has broken out that you have to navigate. In addition to launching on Xbox, the game will be available on PS5 and Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>By the time it launches in 2025, it’ll have been six years since Borderlands 3 was released. While fans have gotten Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and New Tales from the Borderlands in between, it still felt like something was missing. With Borderlands 4, players will explore a brand new location with four new vault hunters along with a cast of returning characters.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-trailer-first-look-at-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at gameplay</a> was shown at The Game Awards 2024 that should quench the thirst for Borderlands content until Gearbox starts giving more deep dives into the game. One thing to expect is less <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“toilet humor”</a> this time around, according to one of the game’s developers. Borderlands 4 is set to release in 2025, and Take-Two has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that it won’t release</a> around GTA 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BioShock Creator Ken Levine "Not Overly Impressed" by Generative AI]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-not-overly-impressed-by-generative-ai.1071861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine has expressed skepticism regarding generative AI, admitting its usefulness for technical tasks but doubting its ability to "tell [him] a really compelling story".</p>

<p>In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Levine is asked for his opinions on generative AI and its "capability to react to players". Levine says he doesn't want to "underestimate" the technology, but that its biggest limitation right now is "persistence".</p>

<p>He gives the example of ChatGPT's video generator Sora, which he says is capable of generating a "beautiful" street scene featuring a woman walking down the street. However, if that woman were to "turn around and walk backwards", Sora wouldn't "remember where she has been".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=A5rCS0Qf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=MLoF-X4n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>won't be using generative AI for its art or narrative.</figcaption></figure><p>It's this lack of persistence that Levine says means AI can't tell him a "really compelling story that has a three-act structure"; in fact, AI can't "even tell [him] multiple scenes", he says, going on to say that he's "not overly impressed" by the technology as it currently stands.</p>

<p>Despite that, Levine acknowledges that generative AI has its uses. He says that it's useful for "training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations", for instance, or "clearing [the&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>dev team's] analytics database".</p>

<p>However, he hasn't used it for concept art, largely "because there's some legal issues" around how generative AI sources its images. In case you're not aware, generative AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can often use art without crediting the original artists</a> when generating content.</p>

<p>The full GI.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> is well worth reading, especially if you're interested in keeping up with Levine's work on&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>. He discusses everything from the game's approach to player choice all the way through to his work on&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>.</p>




<p>Levine isn't the only person in the industry to express skepticism when it comes to gen AI. Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">declared that it had no plans</a> to use the tech in its games, acknowledging similar IP rights issues to Levine.</p>

<p>However, that hasn't stopped companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceo-pledges-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-and-cutting-edge-tech-to" rel="nofollow">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;from going all in on generative AI. It looks like this is a debate that isn't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Swimming In Naiad Is So Good]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/naiad-indie-game-review-steam-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-swimming-in-naiad-is-so-good.1071858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/naiad-indie-game-review-steam-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The swimming in recent indie game <a href="https://www.hiwarp.com/naiad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naiad</em></a> absolutely rules, which is good because you do a lot of it. You play as a water nymph who drifts around doing little nature tasks in the fringes of the human world, exploring the interplay between the environment and the creatures in it. It’s not quite as chill a game as that setup would suggest, but the visuals and swimming mostly make up for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I really cannot say enough good things about the swimming. Made by a solo developer, the basic task of <em>Naiad</em> is to guide your character through rivers, lakes, streams, pipes, and other bodies of beautifully-rendered water to move through its levels. You can dive and rush short distances, or sing to attract schools of fish to follow you on your journey. Basking in pools of sunlight makes your character “grow up,” getting bigger and gaining new abilities to help on her journey. The movement feels exactly as floaty and pleasantly imprecise as being a water-based creature would, and it feels wonderful to find your own path along a river that follows its own path through the landscape. The game shows the world from a top-down perspective, and each area is full of gorgeous vegetation and rocks and light. It’s a lovely game to look at and be in, as you can tell from its trailer:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Naiad - Extended Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2a79VL-PQNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Story-wise, there’s a twee cloud who guides you, and also a swirling black mass that threatens you. There’s also a lot of humans, who do all sorts of bad human things: chop down trees, pollute, crash their cars, argue. Sometimes you stop the humans by scaring them off or interfering with their tasks, but other times you help them by assisting them in building bridges or finding their boat oars. <em>Naiad</em> mostly seems to want to tell a very basic, heavy-handed story of “people bad,” so this fuzzy relationship between your naiad and the humans can feel a little unclear at times.</p><p>I had way more fun with tasks that ignored humans altogether. Most levels have baby ducks you can reunite with their mother, and I spent entirely too long herding distractable ducks around. There are also some frogs you can compel to lily pads, but I would recommend avoiding this unless you want to be driven mad; the frogs want to go everywhere <em>but</em> where you so obviously want them to go, and while I appreciated their rebelliousness, it wasn’t always the fun kind of annoying to try to steer them.&nbsp;</p><p>In between all of this is some puzzle solving, which is where <em>Naiad </em>starts to go a little bit off the rails. The game starts with basic navigation puzzles, simple enough to fit its chill vibe, but they soon become inconsistent and a bit illogical. Why does zipping through these flowers–sometimes in order, sometimes backwards–sometimes break rocks? Why does breaking this human’s vehicle cause a gate to open, when other gates are opened by compelling humans to open them? It’s not always clear why an action leads to a particular consequence, nor where the solution to a puzzle can be found, which means I did a lot of swimming around the edges of levels looking for secret passages, or singing at various objects or creatures to see if anything would happen. This could be particularly frustrating in levels that were large bodies of water instead of narrow streams, where the top-down perspective made it difficult to know where I was supposed to go or if I’d been to an area already. A game where you just move from the top of the screen to the bottom might be too simple, but it feels <em>so good</em> to just do that that other activities sometimes felt clumsy in comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>But the thing that frustrated me the most about <em>Naiad</em> was how long it spent telling me its story was about to end and then not ending. The ominous black swirl starts off sowing doubt in you, in comparison to the cloud’s gentle encouragement, and as the game goes on it keeps warning you that the end is near. But then the game would continue, and the gameplay felt mostly the same, until I felt a mismatch between what the narrative was telling me and what was actually happening. I started feeling impatient for the game to be over–not always because I wasn’t enjoying it, but because it kept hyping up an end that kept not coming. The actual end game is drawn out so long that it almost felt comical; I kept popping into Aftermath’s Slack to express my frustration, but I thought I was so close to the end that I didn’t want to just quit out.</p><p>Some of this is in service of the larger narrative <em>Naiad</em> wants to tell about the cycle of life; when the credits told me it was made in memory of the creator’s grandparents I felt like a monster for yelling “Why aren’t you over?!” at it so frequently. When I’m playing a game for work, I always try to stay aware that my circumstances are different than the average person’s; something might feel too long to me because I’ve been playing a game more than I otherwise would, or because I’m on a deadline. In <em>Naiad</em>’s case, where there was no deadline or requirement, my play session stretched out because the game kept telling me I was close to finishing it and I wanted to see what would happen. It’s not a long game, but it feels like it could have been much shorter.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how negative this all sounds, the look and feel of <em>Naiad</em> is so good that it mostly trumps the rest of my frustrations. It is a simply beautiful game that feels great to navigate, and the first half is wonderfully chill and peaceful. If you take more breaks than I did, its pacing problems might not frustrate you as much. It might be best as a game to play a handful of levels or a chapter in a go, taking time to revel in all the lovely things about it and swimming around with the fish. (Not the frogs, though. Screw the frogs.)</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence.1071843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New information from the latest Circana report, as posted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lejpf37m3k2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella on social media</a>, shows that Marvel Rivals is still taking top spots across multiple platforms. This is the hit new hero shooter, where players can pick a number of Marvel characters to play and battle against others in teams. On <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Steam</a>, Marvel Rivals is in the 1st position and has retained that position for at least a week now. On both Xbox Series and PlayStation 5, the game takes the third spot. It's worth noting that the data for these games only pertains to the US. It isn't too surprising that Marvel Rivals is continuing to be highly successful, with Call of Duty taking the top spot for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, Project Zomboid has shot up the rankings again on Steam and has entered the top 15 on Steam. It takes the 11th spot on Steam after previously being ranked 48 last week. While there doesn't seem to be an ultimately strong cause as to why this has happened, it's possible that it was due to the update that they released for the game on December 17. However, it's an unstable build that only people who opt-in to play them can access, and it's expected that there will be bugs and issues along with the new content. This title has been in Early Access since 2013, and even now, the game is still in Early Access despite receiving a plethora of updates, making it uncertain as to whether this game will ever fully launch.</p>
<p>Another game that has seen a resurgence is Sonic Frontiers. What was a well-received game in 2022 has now ended up taking the 14th spot in the PlayStation 5 rankings. This is due to the game being added to the PS+ catalog, allowing those who are subscribers to get the game for free to keep it until they are no longer subscribed. Other titles such as Jurassic World Evolution 2, Coffee Talk, Aliens: Dark Descent, and Temtem were all added to December's catalog, providing a wide variety for those who are PS Plus members and those who have access to PS Plus Premium and Extra.</p>
<p>Among these titles are games such as Fortnite, Helldivers 2, and Roblox, which doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. These games have been popular throughout the year and have been mainstays for audiences across the globe.</p>
<p>On Steam specifically, Path of Exile 2 has dropped by one ranking and is now down to the 3rd position. While this game has proven to be popular since entering Early Access, they have lately been experiencing an issue where <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-in-security-crisis-after-hackers-raid-players-accounts-stealing-valuables/">accounts are being compromised</a>, and users are losing out on their valuable items, with Grinding Gear Games making no promise to return them.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sifu-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-right-now.1071840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the next free game that you can download and keep right now on its store, and it's perfect for fans of martial arts-based action brawlers, although its relentless difficulty might take some getting used to.</p>

<p>That's right: your next <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free Epic Games Store game</a> is Sloclap's&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, which was actually an Epic Store exclusive on PC until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/martial-arts-brawler-sifu-comes-to-steam-and-xbox-in-march" rel="nofollow">its release on Steam and Xbox</a>&nbsp;in March last year.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a string of free games Epic has been offering up on the Store for the last couple of weeks. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>, along with plenty of others (which you can no longer redeem, unfortunately).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=koXWYtYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=Vk0fyERH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is free to keep right now on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>launched in February 2022, it's received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/show-off-your-style-and-moves-in-sifu-free-summer-2022-update" rel="nofollow">a number of updates</a> bringing features like new game modes, extra modifiers, and more. If you played this one back at launch, it's worth giving it another shot, especially if you were into the core gameplay loop at the time.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, it's a martial arts brawler in which you must battle your way through a series of dungeon-like environments in order to avenge your father.</p>

<p>The game's unique gimmick revolves around a magical talisman you wear; each time you die, you're resurrected, but you age a number of years, gaining attack power in return for a smaller health pool.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>adopts a structure that's not dissimilar to a roguelite; you can either press on with your current run or start again with the permanent upgrades you've already unlocked to give yourself a better chance of reaching the last boss while still young.</p>




<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>isn't the only free game you can claim on PC right now, either. If you head on over to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vambrace_cold_soul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, you can grab yourself a copy of roguelite RPG&nbsp;<em>Vambrace: Cold Soul</em>, and you won't have to pay a penny.</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vambrace&nbsp;</em>has also benefited from a number of updates over the years, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vambrace-cold-soul-update-features-difficulty-tweaks" rel="nofollow">difficulty tweaks</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devespresso-games-announces-new-game-and-more-changes-for-vambrace-cold-soul" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, and plenty more. Again, if you gave it a try at launch but put it down, you might want to pick it up again, especially since it won't cost you anything!</p>

<p>An area of development for two of Hideo Kojima’s upcoming games have been delayed. In a post on social media, Kojima said that both OD and Physint have been impacted by the current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Kojima gave players an update on where things stand with his three main projects — Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint. Regarding Death Stranding 2, he says that the team “started to play and build up the game” over the summer after working on music production, Japanese voice recording, and more. For the other two games, however, there have been hiccups. </p>



<p>First, with OD, Kojima says that game development continued along with actor and environment scanning. In the second half of the year, though, scanning and filming was suspended due to the strike. For Physint, casting was suspended because of the strike.</p>



<p>Kojima said that the hold is to resume next year. That’s as long as a deal reached, of course. The current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July</a> after 18 months of negotiations over AI protections for video game actors. As of publishing, there is no update on where the talks stand.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SAG-AFTRA strike leading to delays for Kojima’s OD and Physint? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Infinity Nikki</h5><p><span>December 5, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Typically, I don't do gacha games. The way they work just doesn't gel with me, as I don't want to get sucked in and end up spending money on it, especially when there are tons of other games that I can play where I don't need to spend money to get ahead or be better in the game. Luckily, Infinity Nikki's gacha system is pretty fair compared to some of the others on the market right now. For the most part, there isn't a bad thing I can say about Infinity Nikki, as it is much like the games I used to play when I was younger and loved dress-up games. As an adult, this brings back many feelings of that childhood joy I experienced and allows me to get sucked into a cozy world full of whimsy and color.</p>
<p>To play this game on PC, you must download the independent launcher or play it via the Epic Games Store. I <span>chose to use the&nbsp;<a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent launcher</a> because I find that games launched through the Epic Games Store just don't run well at all for me, possibly because the launcher is not</span> optimized. Of course, the game is also available on PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Although I knew that the former Director of Zelda, <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">Kentaro Tominaga</a>, was working on Infinity Nikki, it still shocked me just how, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it was not just in the sense of the grand exploration, but also from the trials that you can undertake to get Whimstars. The aesthetic of the trials, in particular, is very reminiscent of those from Tears of the Kingdom, especially ones where you have to use your Purah Pad to be able to get from point A to point B.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-000539.png"></a></figure>

<p>The atmosphere and the aesthetic of the game is breathtaking. Even when you approach the first Warp Spire in the game, the location you get it at is so well decorated and bursting with vibrancy and realism. It's hard not to play Infinity Nikki and take a ton of pictures. Even if you aren't taking pictures of the costumes you unlock for Nikki, there is so much beauty in the surrounding world, especially once you start to progress through the story and discover new locations.</p>
<p>Even without doing the questing, I found myself getting lost in the expansive world, collecting materials that I could use later on to craft new dresses. I've always loved games where I can collect resources and hoard them, and Infinity Nikki allowed me to do just that. Every flower and herb was immediately pocketed, and I continued on my journey.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there wasn't much about Infinity Nikki that I&nbsp;<em>didn't</em> like. The game was magical and everything that younger me would have dreamed of. It definitely appealed to the inner child and allowed me to reminisce about days when I would play dress-up games online. Most controversially, the one character I didn't like was Nikki's sidekick, Momo. They were reminiscent of Paimon from Genshin Impact, and both have voices that I just don't like. Compared to Paimon, Momo was significantly more tolerable but still a touch annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about Infinity Nikki was the game's performance. Admittedly, I do have a pretty powerful PC that I play it on, but when it comes to Unreal Engine 5 games, they don't have the best reputation for how they perform on PC specifically. For example, Silent Hill 2 was a game that ran terribly for me, even after many patches. However, Infinity Nikki felt like a breath of fresh air with how well it ran, even on Ultra settings. Once I got to the central city, the game was a little bit laggy, so I turned the settings down, and it improved significantly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-181551.png"></a></figure>

<p>Florawish was a particularly great city to explore, and I loved being able to climb up buildings, stand on the peak, and look over the people and terrain below. There wasn't a single part of it that wasn't teeming with life and vibrancy, and it was the perfect game to slow down, stop, and smell the roses. There's a lot of exploration to do in Florawish alone, with there being hidden chests in nooks and crannies that you may not even spot unless you're traversing the rooftops. It was fun trying to find everything, and I'm sure even now, I've missed a ton of stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, Infinity Nikki is a fantastic experience and is well-optimized, considering it's made in Unreal Engine 5. I had a lot of fun with the game, and I can't wait to see what is added to it with new updates. My main issue is the fact that you can't change the key binds. As someone who is left-handed and suffers from dexterity issues in my hands, I find that using a controller becomes painful after a while. I would love the option to change the key binds to make the experience more comfortable and streamlined.</p>

				<p>Infinity Nikki is a fantastic game, and you can play it while avoiding most of the gacha elements. It's a great gacha game that doesn't require you to pay any money to it to be able to succeed. It's a game full of whimsy, wonder, and most importantly dressing up and being able to customize Nikki to your liking, depending on the outfits you collect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-2nd-edition-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everyone was dead. She was sure of it. The huge monster of a man wielding a machete had hacked Ranger Sandy to pieces right in front of her eyes, and she had been running for what felt like hours ever since. Even if they had survived, they wouldn't have left her. Would they? She had heard the car start, and she did wonder why the others had sent her a different way to the car. Maybe they would come back for her once they had found a safe place to hide? Hopefully, before that killer found her.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Don't Look Back 2nd Edition</em>! We covered the original <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">Don't Look Back</a></em> box set a few years ago, and recently we covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hametsu</em></a>, also by Black Site Studios.</p>



<p><i>Don't Look Back </i>is a horror miniatures tabletop game that can be played cooperatively against an AI-controlled killer, or with the latest edition, a player can take control of the killer and try to slay their friends. The 1st edition of the game released in 2021, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the 2nd edition update is essentially the same, but with a lot more content in the rulebook.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=iQw3udLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=6zXylbO6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't Look Back</em> captures the horror genre superbly with its mechanics [Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Difference Between The Don't Look Back 1st and 2nd Edition Rulebooks?</h2>

<p>The core rules for <em>Don't Look Back</em> are the same as they were in the 1st edition, with a focus on the layout and presentation of the rules to make them as clear as possible. What the 2nd Edition <em>Don't Look Back</em> core rulebook now contains is a lot more options and background, which includes:</p>

<ul><li>2 new characters (on top of the 6 original 1st edition)</li>
	<li>Rules for randomly generating your own plots&nbsp;(in addition to the five classic&nbsp;core plots)</li>
	<li>Optional rules for vehicles&nbsp;and companions</li>
	<li>Trilogies - Originally a separate book, the new rulebook includes these rules for creating a series of 3 linked games</li>
	<li>Final Call - The 2nd edition core rulebook includes rules for creating your own character, playing as the killer, and also running the game as a games master</li>
	<li>Pack Hunt - It also includes the rules for including multiple killers, and hordes of enemies in your games</li>

<p>The core rules for <i>Don't Look Back</i> are very simple, which is essential for a narrative and theme-driven game as it allows you to focus on what's going on, rather than flipping back and forth through a rulebook, ruining the immersion.</p>

<p>With each turn in <em>Don't Look Back</em>, fright tokens are generated to represent noises, shadows, and eerie effects. The killer can randomly appear from fight tokens, or they might just generate terror for nearby characters. When characters gain terror points, they increase the movement and combat skill of the killer targeting that character, and also reduce a character's rolls, making it more difficult to achieve tasks. If a character ever has double the amount of terror points of their fright value, they are removed from the game, succumbing to panic.</p>

<p>During the game, players need to complete the scenario objective while avoiding the killer and controlling the terror points on their character. Players do this each turn by working together to search areas and removing fright tokens by investigating and shining light tokens on them. They can also lure the killer to an area to allow other characters the freedom to search with the 7 Minutes in Heaven action with another consenting character, in a true horror trope.</p>

<p>As with all miniatures games, you will need a few items on top of the <i>Don't Look Back</i> core rulebook to play:</p>

<ul><li>Three types of dice (D20s, D10s and D6s)</li>
	<li>A measuring tool</li>
	<li>A 3x3 playing area with an assortment of terrain</li>
	<li>A miniature to represent The Killer</li>
	<li>A hero/character miniature for each player</li>
</ul><p><em>Don't Look Back</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, which means you can use any miniatures from any system you want to represent the killer and characters, but <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/dlb" rel="nofollow">Black Site Studios</a> have a whole range of killers (and their rules) and character miniatures, along with scenery that's perfect for the North Wood setting.</p>

<p>We loved <i>Don't Look Back </i>1st edition, it's simple rules let you explore the theme very well without distracting, allowing full immersion. The mechanics complimented the theme perfectly, and nothing has changed in this edition, other than giving you a huge amount of content in a single book. Everything that made <em>Don't Look Back</em> great is still there, only now there's more of it. The added scenario generator, character generator, and ability to play as the killer, or run it with a GM make this an incredibly varied system with a huge amount of replayability, built of a simple set of core mechanics that get it done.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>Even if you own the first edition of <em>Don't Look Back</em>, this updated rulebook has a huge amount of content, all between the same covers to stop you from carrying multiple books around. It's all presented better, with a great opening chapter on the setting and the North Wood area. If you're not a horror fan though, then you won't find much else in <em>Don't Look Back</em> as it's entirely built around the theme.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-says-upcoming-projects-od-and-physint-heavily-impacted-by-strikes.1071807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>creator Hideo Kojima has provided a year-end update on his upcoming projects, currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, and it sounds like SAG strikes heavily impacted both games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Kojima says that during 2024,&nbsp;his studio Kojima Productions "developed [<em>OD</em>] and had actor and environment scanning", but that during the second half of the year, "scanning and filming were suspended due to the SAG strike".</p>

<p>Of&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, Kojima says that "casting was also suspended" for the game owing to the strike. It sounds like&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>is currently a lot earlier in development than&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">the latter has an official trailer</a> (albeit a brief one) and the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">does not</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=DLlPabeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=OptHfXK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima's upcoming games&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>have been impacted by strikes this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, Kojima is likely referring to the July SAG-AFTRA strike, which saw voice actors and mocap artists going on strike after negotations regarding generative AI protections broke down.</p>

<p>The strike is technically still ongoing; at time of writing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">no overarching agreement</a> has been reached, although a number of gaming companies have signed agreements with SAG in order to protect its members from generative AI exploitation.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Kojima's message, he says that he and his studio "hope to resume next year", which evidently means that the filming, capture, and casting processes haven't restarted for either&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</p>

<p>Kojima also recaps the rest of his year in the message, as well as providing an update on the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>film, which is being produced in conjunction with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">movie production company A24</a>. He says preparations for the movie, as well as "other adaptations", are underway.</p>

<p>Kojima's message also comes just under two months after the surprise Xbox release of the original&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, which also saw Kojima Productions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights to the IP</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1337100/view/523078230806103089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post on Steam</a>, Carbon says that it's delisting the game "as our license reaches its conclusion", and that it'll no longer be available on any storefront. That means you won't be able to buy it on Steam, Meta, or Viveport.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will first be removed from Steam on January 10th, which is also when support for the game on that platform will be rescinded. Carbon says the timeline for delisting on Meta and Viveport is "still under review" and that an update will be provided "as soon as more information becomes available".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall-delisted-skeleton.jpg?itok=gchsYOoK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall-delisted-skeleton.jpg?itok=NKFe6LmA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will soon...well...fall.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that you'll still be able to play the game on your chosen platform if you've already bought it; as is usually the case with delisting, you simply won't be able to buy <i>Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>Carbon says it understands that news of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall</em>'s delisting "may come as a disappointment". It sounds like the studio had no choice but to pull the game from stores since the license holders (likely Games Workshop in this case) were unwilling to renew said license.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game based on a major fantasy license being pulled from stores soon.&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">also making its exit from digital storefronts</a> in February, although I imagine that's probably less sad news than&nbsp;<em>Tempestfall</em>'s demise for many.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=mNgC54Gi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=3kDBuy0g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game being delisted soon.</figcaption></figure><p>These two games join the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em></a>, racing game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Horizon 4</em></a>, and PlatinumGames' mobile action game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">World of Demons</a>&nbsp;</em>in the delisting vortex; it's no longer possible to buy any of these games on digital storefronts.</p>

<p>To combat games being delisted and support being removed from said games, digital storefront GOG recently launched its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which guarantees that any game belonging to the Program will be supported forever, regardless of whether its developers or publishers support it.</p>

<p>If you want to buy <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>before it's delisted, you can do so via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337100/Warhammer_Age_of_Sigmar_Tempestfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall/4617889574904734/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>, or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/8e1e49fc-e4df-4c3e-8387-df8cca8a8890?hl=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq3HWS0qANSe2mG4MZJk1fg5WhBIm24ZN04WPak9As-Q9oUaIjK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Viveport</a> right now. Be aware that you will need a VR headset to enjoy it, though.</p>

Heismay isn’t the bright-eyed optimist that you’d expect to find fighting for a better, more progressive world. He starts off as a recluse, accused of a crime he didn’t commit, all while trying to grieve his lost son. When the one thing that was your whole world is gone, what point is there in hoping for a better day? Heismay is a punching bag wherever he goes. He’s subject to prejudice for being a eugief and his own people have their own reasons for subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment. If there was ever a person who had a reason to cast all hope and compassion aside, it’s Heismay. But just because one loses their way without a light doesn’t mean they have to stumble through the dark. Heismay doesn’t have his son to care for any longer, but he still finds ways to honor him, telling stories of the child he lost so he never forgets the guiding light he once had.</p><p>Moving forward when you feel like you have nothing to live for can seem impossible, even if you have people who support you through your darkest moments. Heismay was nearly too far gone, feeling too weak to carry on. He was ready to die in the sandworm-infested desert and leave the uncaring world behind him. But finding something to live for in a world that feels rigged against you and makes you face constant heartache and loss is true strength. Heismay is half the size of his teammates but with twice the heart. He is the struggle of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> personified, finding hope in a world that has given him no reason to so much as look for it. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-recommend-id="image://ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-recommend-id="image://ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Indiana Jones has always had a terrific assortment of friends around the world.

Not some stuffy or stereotypical figure, Antonio’s a three-dimensional person and a delight. A moral figure but not a moralizing one, he’s a man who looks with fear on the turning of political tides around the globe but still wants to be able to savor the good things in life, like that humdinger of an American record that Indy brings him as a gift.</p><p>Played terrifically by Enrico Colantoni, an actor with an impressive resumé who I’m most familiar with from his work in <em>Galaxy Quest </em>as Mathesar, the leader of the Thermians, Antonio is thoughtful and believable, a crucial part of <em>The Great Circle</em>’s wonderful globehopping, pseudo-historical texture. And so, while the game<em> </em>saw me laying my eyes on the pyramids of Gizeh, on ancient statues of the Buddha, and on other wonderful sights and cultural wonders, it may be that the sight I’ll remember most is that of Antonio, this keenly intelligent, kind, wonderful priest who wears hearing aids, dancing with delight to the groovy sounds of the latest hit out of New York City. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-recommend-id="image://70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-recommend-id="image://70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Iris is an enigma through most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span>, but she’s also the most important character in its melodramatic science-fiction tale. At one point in time, she was just a teenage girl with teenage problems. She had a friend who annoyed her, a mother who thrust her expectations upon her, and like teenagers often are, she was never willing to open up to most people. When an alien invasion and an accompanying disease wiped out the rest of humanity, she was left alone with no one but clones of herself to carry on society. Iris became a god-like figure to her “daughters” and even as she ascended to a throne of her own making, the same anger, resentment, and insecurity she felt as a child grew with her. When the only people around you are copies of yourself, there’s no one there to check you as you rise beyond what any human should ever be. The farther you lift yourself above those you consider beneath you, the harder you’ll hit the ground when you fall. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Okay look, I’m no <em>Star Wars </em>lore expert—for that, we’d need Zack, but he’s not here today, so you’re stuck with me instead.

Droids in <em>Star Wars</em>, in my opinion, often kind of fall into this uncomfortable space. On one hand, the franchise sees them as unfairly discriminated against, but on the other, it’s long been wary of reckoning with whether or not droids actually <em>are </em>sentient—should we care if a droid is forced to do slave labor or has its memory wiped, or are they actually just robots that may put on a show of having real thoughts and feelings but remain just disposable machines?</p><p>Increasingly in recent years, however, it’s seemed to me that <em>Star Wars </em>no longer wants to treat the sentience of droids with any ambiguity, and ND-5 is one of the best examples yet of a droid whose inner life is clearly as rich and complex as that of any other living being. You can see the ways in which he’s torn between old loyalties and his desire to be a faithful friend to Kay Vess. In other words, he’s a terrific supporting character for a story set in the criminal underworld of <em>Star Wars</em>, one who illuminates all the shades of doubt and conflict that come with existing in that world, and the uneasy way that he and Kay work their way toward a kind of understanding and partnership helps make those elements feel personal. Here’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of these two. I really want to see where their adventures take them next. —Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-recommend-id="image://3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-format="jpg" data-width="1281" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-recommend-id="image://3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-format="jpg" data-width="1281" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span>, Curly is a haunting reminder of the consequences of his own actions. The game frames the captain of the <em>Tulpar </em>spaceship as the instigator of a crash landing that stranded him and his crew. His haunting burnt figure is mummified and he is left unable to speak, though he is kept alive and force-fed painkillers by his remaining crew as they try to survive the circumstances he ostensibly led them to.</p><p>While <em>Mouthwashing</em> adds a lot of nuance to Curly’s role in how everything went down, his design is one of the most striking of any video game character this year. His lone uncovered eye follows you through the room, you have to pry open his mouth to give him pills, and the visceral discomfort <em>Mouthwashing </em>creates every time you interact with him only grows as the psychological horror game goes off the rails in the second half. <em>Mouthwashing </em>turned out to be one of the breakout hits of 2024, and the image of Curly’s burnt figure has become one of the most iconic visual elements of any game this year. Despite its horrifying nature, Curly’s post-crash design has become a surprising cosplay trend online.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-recommend-id="image://ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-recommend-id="image://ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Year of Shadow is nearly over, and Sega delivered on bringing Sonic’s angsty rival back into the spotlight. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>did an excellent job of utilizing Keanu Reeves’ soulful performance, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span><em> </em>felt like an apology for flattening one of the <em>Sonic </em>series’ most complex characters for nearly 20 years.

A clerk at Toronto’s Royal Canadian Museum in 1914, Nancy’s got big dreams and a big intellect, but society isn’t so supportive of her ambitions of studying geology at the university. Not one to be daunted, however, she seizes an opportunity to investigate the discovery of a massive diamond in the remote town of Crimson. Her can-do attitude serves her well, too, as she winds up getting much more than she bargained for when the diamond claim becomes a murder investigation.</p><p>Like a good Agatha Christie mystery, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>features a colorful cast of memorable characters as suspects, and Nancy’s good-natured determination and practicality (she takes excellent notes!) make her the ideal person to hold down the center of this narrative whirlwind. It’s great to see the adventure genre get a bold new entry in the form of <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, and to see the genre’s pantheon of female heroes—Rosella, Laura Bow, April Ryan, Kathy Rain, and others—welcome a terrific new member. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-recommend-id="image://61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-recommend-id="image://61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Characters have always been BioWare’s bread and butter, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> has the strongest collective cast that the studio has ever put into its fantasy RPG series. There are no flops hanging out in the Lighthouse and scheming to stop the elven gods from taking over Thedas. Neve, the Tevinter detective, is a dutybound freedom fighter who still finds time to care about the little guy when the world is ending. The necromancer Emmrich spends hours waxing about the cultural significance of death but can’t just safely depersonalize it through study, instead needing to confront whether or not he’s actually at peace with what it means to manipulate death. Davrin, the elven Grey Warden, has spent so long assuming his life was forfeit that he has trouble conceptualizing a life for himself if he’s no longer doomed by the narrative.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is full of small moments that encapsulate big ideas. Taash struggles with their gender, and it plays into the push and pull they feel between the culture they grew up in and the one they’re drawn to. Bellara is inextricably wrapped up in the history of her people, the Dalish Elves, and she uses that history as a reference for her own fiction which you can stumble upon her writing. Lucanis has a demon inside him that takes over his body when he sleeps, so he drinks more coffee than an overstimulated college student. Harding begins <em>The Veilguard </em>in a drab, unkempt room in the Lighthouse, but as she stays there, her caring nature shines through as it’s gradually grown over by a garden of her own making.</p><p>No, the members of the titular Veilguard don’t bicker or want to kill each other like the characters in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games; instead, each of them is a beacon of light that shines all its own in a dark world that may grow darker if they don’t save it. Everyone wants to fight for a better Thedas, even as they each occupy disparate areas of BioWare’s fantasy world. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/31/game-of-the-year-2024-overall-winner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As the end of the year looms large, it signals the close of our awards season, too. We’ve celebrated this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/game-of-the-year-2024-best-visual-design/">incredible visuals</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/22/game-of-the-year-2024-best-gameplay/">innovative gameplay</a>, and each platform’s best titles, but someone has to be the winner, sitting atop this remarkable pile like a particularly proud mole. Our winner resoundingly stood out as a celebration of PlayStation, and gaming as a whole, focussing on fun, and evoking a purity of vision that is rarely found in AAA games.</p>

<p>It has been a good year for games, but with so many blockbusting new games and genuine surprises, more incredible remakes than you can shake a stick at, even games backed by hundreds of millions could struggle to stand out from the crowd. Diminutive though they might be, Astro did exactly that.</p>
<p>And with good reason — what started out as effectively a tech demo has blossomed into something that shows off the absolute best of PlayStation. Not only is it an absolute nostalgia fest, but it is an incredibly well-designed game.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that you are searching the universe for your missing buddies. Each level is a beautiful and moreish platformer, with upbeat music, colourful enemies and all manner of things to keep you entertained and engaged — like the special weapons and items that are key to your success. The level design is both varied and the right level of challenging, with super-hard optional side levels for those looking for sweaty palms.</p>

<p>As we said in our review, where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">we awarded Astro a very rare 10/10</a>, “Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>
<p>Well done Astro, you cute little guy, you are well deserving of TheSixthAxis’s Game of the Year Award for 2024.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>In other years, Metaphor could easily have been the one taking this prize home, but even though it’s been hopped over by the delightful Astro, it stands out as this year’s most immersive and impressive RPG. Coming from the team of developers behind the iconic Persona series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> could have just been Persona in fantasy land, but it’s so much more.</p>
<p>The new setting of Euchronia let Studio Zero really flex its creative muscles, giving us a world filled with interesting characters, unique races, and some of the most bonkers enemy designs you’ve ever seen. It’s little surprise that it took home this year’s Best Visual Design award, as it looks absolutely stunning. It takes the ‘living anime’ aesthetic and runs with it, bringing creative and fresh ideas to what can often be a staid and conventional genre.</p>
<p>The story, centred on the crowning of a new monarch following the king’s death, takes a series of unexpected turns and asks question after question about race, religion and the nature of democracy, all of which feel incredibly salient in the present day. Metaphor ReFantazio is a remarkable game, and one which everyone should experience.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Dropping onto the scene amidst a cacophony of patriotic explosions and grandiose orchestral music to fight bugs, bots and (as of a few weeks ago) the brainwashed masses, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was a smash hit. Even though it’s a sequel and follows a familiar formula and game design ethos for the team at Arrowhead, it rode the wave of modern co-op gaming.</p>
<p>You see, you’re dropping in and facing off against what often feels like impossible odds, only able to even things out with the use of bombastic orbital support – emphasis very much on the ‘bomb’ there – but when that support is invariably danger close and a delightful mix of massively and minimally effective, and being called in willy-nilly by everyone on your team…. let’s just say it’s a good thing you’ve got some spare clones.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 had some ups and downs through the year, though. Launch was hampered by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/helldivers-2-patch-notes-1-000-12-server-cap-limit-raised/">massive demand on the servers</a>, the early <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-update-1-000-100-brings-inevitably-unpopular-balance-changes/">balance updates took things in the wrong direction</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">there was the whole PSN fiasco</a>, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">the most recent update adding a third faction</a> and the balance in a bit of a sweet spot, it’s no wonder that player counts swelled massively once more as people answered the call.</p>

<p>Co-op games are alive and well, and many more are scheduled to be released in 2025 to fraternize with friendships and reinforce relationships—maybe. 2025’s co-op titles ensure plenty of reason to be optimistic if you enjoy playing on a couch with a friend, or online.</p>



<p>I come from a generation of playing PlayStation 1 and 2 games with friends in co-op. The feeling of sitting next to someone and experiencing the same whirlwind of emotions together as you beat a level is something the intangible nature of online co-op can’t replicate. However, I choose online co-op over no co-op at all—which is the way the games industry seemed to be heading for a while.</p>



<p>The art of co-op continues to thrive, and 2025’s biggest partner-up titles are already stirring up emotions again.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Who are you? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 is cutting back on the toilet humor</a>, but this shouldn’t detract from what is sure to be another wild Pandora ride. Co-op has been a big aspect of the series since its debut, encouraging you to team up with other Vault Hunters and take out gun-wielding corporate stooges, and deranged Psychos. Borderlands 4 looks to be more of what we’ve become accustomed to, and I’m so glad I can use a plethora of inane weapons to destroy with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ew. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>As an FPS enthusiast, I really can’t wait for Killing Floor 3. If you love first-person shooters with gory action, gratuitous violence, banging soundtracks, and replayability, Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is the answer. Its stylings and gameplay share a lot in common with modern DOOM, sure, but this isn’t a bad thing. In a world rife with hero, extraction, and military shooters, Killing Floor 3 is a gruesome breath of blood-soaked air. Lock and load with a squad of up to six friends to take down Zeds.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Disgusting and delightful. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Low and Alone are the new and curiously named protagonists of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—with the emphasis being on the plural. There are <em>two main characters</em> to escort through a seemingly inescapable journey of hell this time around; and you can do this on your own, switching between the two, or have a second person join you. It’s probably better for your sanity if you have someone to hold onto during Little Nightmare 3’s decidedly hairier moments.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dual dissection. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dying Light franchise continues with 2025’s The Beast. This standalone sequel sees Kyle Crane return to the main title role—hero of the original—and it’s set some 13 years later. Kyle is a grizzled, zombie-killing veteran at this point, but a second pair of veteran-like hands doesn’t go amiss. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> supports co-op, and buddying up improves your survival chances during the series’ neverending outbreak.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</h3>



<figure><figcaption>How to make the best better. Credit to Bandai Namco &amp; FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was easily one of the most shocking announcements from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. A fascinating crossover featuring FromSoftware’s Elden Ring world, and the influence of action experts—Bandai Namco Entertainment. It’s not DLC, this is a fully-fledged game, and one of the biggest differences between Nightreign and traditional Elden Ring is co-op. Nightreign allows you to team up into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio</a> (not two, sadly) and enjoy the splendor and sickness of an alternate Limgrave in harrowing harmony.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This ain’t no kitchen. Credit to Ghost Town Games Ltd.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to describe the angst and frustration caused by your fiancé failing to execute a last-minute beef patty throw to earn full stars on a level—but this was part of Overcooked’s charm. Ghost Town Games cooked up magic with the cooking simulation franchise, and the studio is moving to pastures new with Stage Fright. The team’s creativity looks to be in full effect here with Stage Fright promising two distinct worlds playing out side-by-side, and you need to solve puzzles and escape predicaments with a co-op cohort. This is one to keep an eye on for sure.</p>

<p>Finally, what better way to round out this list? Hazelight Studios is masterminded by the enigmatic auteur Josef Fares. The charismatic director has helmed iconic co-op games, including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, A Way Out, and It Takes Two—proclaimed GOTY by The Game Awards in 2021. Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> has the impossible task of trying to one-up It Takes Two, but the early signs are promising, and this task might be possible. It’s designed purely with co-op in mind, and has you taking part in a ton of mini-games and trying out many gameplay-shifting concepts. Split Fiction’s expectations are high, and it includes the lauded “Friend’s Pass” system again—meaning you only need one copy!</p>
