            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-pc-patch-upscaling-broken<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, publisher Bethesda and developer Virtuos released a patch for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>on the Microsoft Store "for a few backend tweaks", but it's done a lot more damage than intended, it seems.</p>

<p>The update, which runs about 2GB, wasn't intended to address anything "directly impacting gameplay", according <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp04r76/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to Bethesda</a>, but as the studio points out, the update has "affected some Microsoft Store players' UI settings for graphical settings".</p>

<p>More specifically, the update appears to have completely disabled upscaling functionality, and although Bethesda says any settings adjusted prior to the update "are still enabled and function normally", that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp05r7t/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem</a> to be the experience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp0c65e/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp099lj/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">having</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-upscaling-patch-field.jpg?itok=tdSl3uKs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-upscaling-patch-field.jpg?itok=ngTkBVzw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion Remastered</em>'s latest Microsoft Store PC patch is causing some issues.</figcaption></figure><p>I can confirm the issue still hasn't been fixed, and that Bethesda's comments about graphical settings that were enabled prior to the update doesn't seem to apply to me. When I booted up&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>this morning, my FSR had been turned off and I was unable to turn it back on.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this problem doesn't seem to be affecting Steam players, but since an awful lot of people are going to be checking out&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass, that's not as much of a salve as you might expect.</p>

<p>So, what's going on here? Well, some players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7lsaz/comment/mp08nz8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">theorizing</a> that it's possible Bethesda has pushed an update intended for Xbox consoles to the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>Resolution scaling is locked, like it would be on console, and it's not possible to change resolution scaling options anymore, which suggests the game "wants to force you to run at 60fps like a console would", as Redditor SnakeHelah points out.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why a lack of resolution scaling might be a problem, scaling is the only way many people with slightly less powerful gaming PCs can play&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>; it greatly raises frame rates and improves performance for a lot of folks.</p>




<p>If that is indeed what's happening, then it's pretty much par for the course when it comes to Bethesda; this is a studio well-known for technical gaffes, and although the remaster's development was handled by Virtuos, it seems it can't escape the shadow of its publisher.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Virtuos'&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, it's an updated version of the 2006 RPG that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdropped (i.e. launched without warning) last week</a>, although numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">leaks</a> had already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">pointed to the remaster's existence</a> prior to its official announcement.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it's also on Game Pass, although it might be worth holding off on playing that version on PC if you don't have a supremely powerful rig.</p>

All of this culminates in a shot of Joel and Ellie’s silhouettes walking side by side through the infected environment.</p><p>Well, it used to do that. Now that Joel’s met his end at the hands of Abby, HBO decided to make a little edit just to break your heart.

I have been ripping the show a new one in my recaps, but this is the kind of shit that stabs me right in the heart. Sure, Ellie might not be alone, as she still has so many people who care about her in Dina, Jesse, Tommy, and Maria, but when you’ve lost someone as important to you as Joel was to her, it probably feels like you’re walking through this infected world alone. That shit hurt real good. GG, Mazin.

<p>Star Wars Eclipse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced at the 2021 Game Awards</a>, where it was revealed it would have a High Republic setting. The affluent High Republic era is set around 200 years before the Skywalker Saga. (It's not to be confused the Old Republic, set thousands of years prior.) Happily, this means Jar Jar himself won't be featuring.</p>
<p>However, since that time, very little else has been heard of the game. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">the studio described Star Wars Eclipse as "simmering"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière said the studio's teams had not been impacted by cuts made by its owner NetEase. At this time, the company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">the studio was "continuing to develop our projects at full pace"</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, former lead writer for Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> and Star Wars Eclipse Adam Williams revealed he had left the studio after 10 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">He subsequently announced his new studio, Republic Games</a>, which is working on a handcrafted "dark, mature fantasy RPG".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As revealed by developer Cygames <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1916479480308420635" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>'s English version will be arriving on June 26th. Back in June last year, when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release" rel="nofollow">Western release was first announced</a>, it looked like the PC version wouldn't be joining the mobile versions, but PC has been officially confirmed for the West now too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's worth explaining what's going on here, at least to the best of my (limited) ability.</p>

<p>Horse girls who distinguish themselves get to go to the Tracen Academy in Tokyo, where they'll learn not only to be racers once again, but also to be Japanese-style idols.</p>

<p>The horses in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>are real-life animals, too; Japanese horses like T M Opera O, Rice Shower, and Mejiro McQueen make appearances in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, although naturally, even the stallions become pretty anime girls.</p>

<p>This game isn't the first&nbsp;<em>Umamusume&nbsp;</em>game to come West, either. Back in August last year, the party game <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby - Party Dash&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-finally-coming-west-with-party-game-for-ps4-switch-pc" rel="nofollow">launched for PC, PS4, and Switch</a>, giving many their first taste of what can reasonably be described as an unusual franchise.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is a gacha sports sim in which you race the titular Umamusume against one another, training them and trading them as you see fit.</p>

<p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cygames.umamusume" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/umamusume-pretty-derby/id6480433538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> on June 26th. Pre-registration and wishlisting are both open for all platforms now.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers Larian announced that they were working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>, neither of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dd-makers-also-want-a-baldurs-gate-4-but-say-they-wont-rush-to-a-sequel-it-shouldnt-take-25-years-mind">Baldur's Gate 4</a>. Now, fresh from the labour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees">pumping BG3 full of bees</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more about how Belgium's finest mindflayer-wranglers are organising development of these mystery projects. </p><!--more-->
<p>The idea is that one will spin out of pre-production just as the other completes production, avoiding the familiar problem where lots of animators, modellers and other staff have to sit around aimlessly fondling D20s, while management and the Ideas People work on the direction and schedule. Instead, production staff will work on one game while the other is in pre-production, reducing downtime. Vincke acknowledges that the odds of pulling this transition off flawlessly are low. "In practice, we will probably be miserable," he says, "and there's going to be plenty of stuff that went wrong." Words to live by.</p>
<p>All that's from an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9">Gamespot</a>, as passed on by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/larian-boss-swen-vincke-says-the-studio-is-deep-in-the-trenches-on-its-crazy-ambitious-follow-up-to-baldurs-gate-3-hopes-to-show-it-off-no-later-than-2030-because-my-wife-will-divorce-me-if-it-takes-longer/">PCGamer</a>. Vincke described the first of Larian's two new things as both "crazy-ambitious" and "shaping up quite well, actually". But he added that working on the first new game alongside the second, later project is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."</p>
<p>Still, Vincke thinks it's worth doing to avoid the stop-start pre-production/production issue. "When that very large group is finished," commented Vincke, "and the people at the beginning are not ready, then everybody is fucked, because everybody has to wait. That's what we're trying to avoid."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have around 470 people on staff as of 2024, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">currently operate seven studios</a> around the world. While the craven backlog-expanders amongst you may focus on the prospect of Larian releasing games at a faster rate, Vincke hopes that one outcome of running projects in parallel will be less ambiguity and a better quality of life for the developers.</p>
<p>"I hope I can tell you five years from now: We cracked it. We figured it out," he said. "This is what we're doing now. Here's game one, we're making this completely different thing. Game two, and when game two is going to be ready, we already have another thing that's gonna come. If we can make that work in a really good way, that we enjoy our lives, that's gonna be mission accomplished."</p>
<p>What could Larian's undisclosed somethings be? The boring smart money says that one of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-definitely-return-to-the-divinity-series-at-some-point-after-baldurs-gate-3">Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Still, "crazy-ambitious" covers a lot of ground. Perhaps they're making an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you play as a large body of water or the concept of Wednesdays. Perhaps they're conjuring a whole, actually new genre of fantasy - something the marketing people can't summarise by cramming "punk" onto the end of a familiar word and acting like they've just discovered penicillin.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-handheld-mode-resolution-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will be among the Nintendo Switch 2 games releasing in the system's launch window that will hit the maximum resolution offered by the system's screen, according to new information.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Japanese company <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/feature/magazine_2025special/sp/index.html?page=2&amp;device=sp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the digital version of its Nintendo Magazine 2025 Special Issue focused on the new system. While most of the information included in the magazine is not new, we did get on page 12 the confirmation that Donkey Kong Bananza will run at up to 1080p resolution, 60 FPS with HDR in handheld mode. Considering launch titles usually don't take full advantage of a new system, this is definitely impressive, although a more thorough analysis will be needed to see how often the game will indeed run at 1080p and how stable the 60 FPS target will be.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza feels like a new beginning for the character and its franchise, although the game is not a reboot, given Cranky Kong's presence. Besides featuring a new design for the iconic character, the game plays a lot differently from its predecessors, as Donkey Kong can now use his fists to destroy the environment. You can learn more about how these new mechanics shape the experience in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/"> preview.</a></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda has opened up suggestions for improvements to its hugely-popular The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster, and fans have begun weighing in via reddit and Discord with their requests. 
</p>
<p>
Among the top ideas, we've seen a few come up repeatedly - and those who've played the remaster already may well be able to guess what they are.
</p>
<p>
First off, is difficulty. "There must be a difficulty level between Adept and Expert!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k96i47/bethesda_is_taking_suggestions_for_oblivion/?sort=confidence">wrote WheelsOnFire</a>, to the agreement of many others who believe Adept is too straightforward, but Expert is too much of a grind.
</p>
<p>
"I'm still having moments of actually having to try at level 19 if I'm ganged up on, but for the most part my health barely goes down on Adept," another fan noted. "Even going out of my way not to over-level constitution. While expert makes even single mobs a slog at times."

<p>
"It's truly ridiculous," wrote another fan. "After a while Adept is just too easy so I've been playing on Expert and I die eight times every dungeon and go through like 30 potions it's insane."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of dungeons, there are several popular requests regarding those, too. 
</p>
<p>
"[A] cleared tag on cleared dungeons on the world map like in Skyrim!" suggested Kalameet7, to much agreement. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, also the world map automatically zooming in to your location when you're in a dungeon instead of having to manually do it from the over land view every single time," wrote the appropriately-named ITrageGuy. We've seen many similar requests from others about this too - and hopefully it's an easy thing to fix.
</p>
<p>
Other popular quality of life changes include the ability to see weight when looting, modify your character build later in the game, bundling the game's many keys onto a keyring, and better animations for the remaster's newly-added ability to sprint. 
</p>
<p>
Fans have also asked for a couple of other more modern features - a photo mode, and the ability to call your horse. Imagine seeing that gleaming horse armour trotting towards you!
</p>
<p>
We've seen a number of fans ask Bethesda to add proper mod support, especially on consoles, similar to that found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has already said it will not be officially supporting Oblivion Remastered mods</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">that hasn't stopped fans from quickly getting to work on PC anyway</a>.
</p>
<p>
But with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">huge popularity of Oblivion now, with over four million players</a> - could Bethesda change its mind?
</p>
<p>
And finally, here's one that would be fun: "Change it so when you wake up after your first sleep, you wake up in the back of the wagon at the start of Skyrim," wrote JustSomeGuyThing. You were trying to cross the border, right?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-8-0-two-more-exclusives/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-0-8-0-is-now-available-for-download-two-more-ps4-exclusives-now-run-on-the-emulator.1175190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-8-0-two-more-exclusives/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a variety of enhancements that should improve emulation of different games.</p>
<p>The 0.8.0 version, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.8.0">here</a>, doesn't come with any major new feature like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-7-0-amd-fsr-hdr-download/"> 0.7.0 version</a>, which introduced AMD FSR and HDR support, but it still packs a lot of technical core, libraries, GPU, shader recompiler, and GUI enhancements that should provide some welcome improvements to emulation in different games.</p>
<p>Even before the ShadPS4 0.8.0 version was released, some emulation improvements were already added to the PlayStation 4 emulator in work-in-progress versions. These improvements allow the emulator to run two additional PS4 exclusives, the racing game Driveclub and the open-world game InFAMOUS Second Son, although both games are not exactly in a playable state with visual issues and bad performance, as highlighted in the videos below shared by BrutalSam. Still, considering how Bloodborne went from barely launching on the emulator to being playable from beginning to end in just a few months, it shouldn't take too much time for the emulation of both games to improve, and allow PC players to experience two more games that are unlikely ever to get officially ported.</p>

<p><iframe title="inFamous Second Son on ShadPS4 v0.7.1 wip" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7QbrA0ijLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By making Bloodborne playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator opened the doors for modding projects that improved what is still one of the best games released by FromSoftware. Among these is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/"> Remaster Project by fromsoftserve</a>, which introduces visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flowers, first kills, and ‘okay’ kisses. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 3.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s episode of The Last of Us takes a moment to grieve and breathe after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-review">last week’s showstopper</a>. It also takes a little detour from the game; much of this episode depicts the reaction of Jackson’s people to the events they’ve just suffered, and their vote on if they should pursue Abby or not. This is all original material for the show, and so there’s actually very few scenes in this episode that are taken straight from the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four key sequences from this episode that are recreations of moments from the game, and here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Joel’s House</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/house-1745831568199.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the harrowing murder of Joel in episode 2, Ellie visits her deceased father-figure’s house to mourn. As in the game, the front yard is covered in flowers left by the residents of Jackson. Unlike the game, though, Ellie enters alone rather than accompanied by Dina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show’s version of Joel’s house features many of the same props that decorated this location in the game, including his workshop room full of carved animals. In Joel’s bedroom, the bed linen is the same blue and white sheets. More importantly there’s the same red box on the bed that contains his signature items: the broken watch and his revolver. Ellie takes these and holsters the revolver in the waistband of her jeans, just as she does in the game.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tommy’s Plans</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tommy-revenge-1745831590003.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The need for revenge begins to rise when Ellie talks to Tommy about what happened. While the broad strokes of this scene are the same in both show and game, particularly in tone, the actual setting and words are not recreated one-to-one. In both versions Ellie is angry and frustrated that Tommy wants to be more sensible about their next move, and so tonally the scenes match. However, where in the game this conversation takes place in a quiet, private room between just the two of them, in the show it’s conducted out in the open with Dina present.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of dialogue there are close matches – both versions of Ellie say that Joel “would be halfway to Seattle by now” if the situation was reversed. Both versions of Tommy also note that Jackson would be left vulnerable, although in the show this is a clear reference to the prior episode’s horde attack rather than the game’s more general assessment. In both scenarios Tommy says it’s ultimately up to Maria as to if they get to hunt down Abby, but in the show he says that it will need to go to a full town vote, while the game version says he expects there will be “folks she can spare”. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ride to Seattle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/horse-1745831609043.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie and Dina head out to Seattle on horseback in search of Abby and her group. In both versions Dina asks Ellie to recall the first person she killed, and Ellie proceeds to explain how she saved Joel from a bandit in the first game/season. While the show’s dialogue is not an exact match to the game’s script, the details are largely the same – Joel was attacked and Ellie pulled the trigger to save him. The conversation is longer in the game, however, as Dina reciprocates with her own story of her first kill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, the pair discover an overgrown car, which they consider a sign that they’re finally close to Seattle. This is, again, broadly similar to a moment from the game, even if the dialogue line is not a one-to-one match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6 out of 10</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/kiss-1745831633066.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode we see Ellie and Dina camped out in a tent. Before lights out, Dina asks Ellie a question: how would she rate their kiss at the dance out of 10? This moment is a recreation of a scene from the game, but the timing and content of this conversation is notably different to the original game version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Dina asks Ellie to rate the kiss while they are smoking marijuana at Eugene’s weed den. As we know from last week’s episode, this doesn’t happen in the show since it is Jesse, not Dina, who accompanies Ellie to Eugene’s den. It’s not just the time and location of this exchange that is altered, though. In the show, Ellie says that she’d rate the kiss a six, something that Dina is playfully upset about. In the game, it’s flipped – Ellie hesitates to answer, and so Dina says she’d score it a “solid six”. The two interpretations showcase very different dynamics; Dina in the game is much more confident and knows how to pull Ellie’s strings – she enjoys teasing her. Dina in the show, meanwhile, is depicted as more “teenage” in her approach, which emphasises the “young girls in the apocalypse” element of their love story.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-review">spoiler-filled review of the third episode</a>.

			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was definitely among the success stories of the first half of 2025<span>.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It sold two million units in the first two weeks</a> and received</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread acclaim from critics</a> and users alike. However, the game took a long time to make: there was almost a seven-year gap from the first installment's release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1kpjbR1Cg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with The Game Business</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Game Director Daniel Vávra has now openly revealed that he suffered health issues from the lengthy and stressful development. He also wishes that the 'AI revolution' could accelerate game development speed, especially since he has at least a couple of ideas that he believes might find as much success as KCD.</p>
<p><em>I want to rest a little bit. It was really tough. I had some serious health issues last year from all the stress and stuff like that, so I really need to slow down a little bit. I have a lot of ideas on what to do. Time is short. It really annoys me that the games take so much time to do, because I have more ideas than I have time.</em></p>
<p><em>There are a couple of projects that I would love to do, and I would love to prepare them properly so it's not as chaotic. I hope that maybe the AI revolution will help with this, that in the future we will not be replaced by AI, but we will be helped by AI a lot, so a lot of things could get easier and faster. I hope that it will happen, and it would be great if this happened.</em></p>
<p><em>Generally, I have a couple of big ideas that I would like to make that will require a lot of time and preparation, so maybe I will focus on those. Of course, there are some DLCs for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and stuff like that, but that was already announced. In the far future, there are</em><br>
<em>still a couple of projects that I would like to do, and in my opinion, they have as much potential as KCD.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Director also praised <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parent company Embracer</a> for giving Warhorse Studios a lot of creative leeway.</p>
<p><em>Actually, Embracer had - I believe it still has - the idea that Lars Wingefors, who is the CEO, is giving the studios a lot of freedom. So, generally, we had a lot of trust and we could do basically whatever we wanted. There was almost zero outside influence on the creative decisions on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is great if it works and when you are not insane. I understand that the corporation wants to have some control over the final product when it invests a lot of money, but generally we had a lot of freedom and it worked.</em></p>
<p>The game has three premium DLCs scheduled to launch within the next few months: Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesiae.</p>

<p>As discovered on a now-removed portfolio, and originally reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-star-wars-eclipse-concept-art-leak">MP1st</a>, the WIP and/or prototype images include shots of a Zenezian, a Rodian, and a Gungan. There are some characters who are described as smugglers, and a couple of possible character names: "Travis" and "Jotraaaz Kammzzzek", which suggests that Eclipse will walk an <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>-style path around the brainfarts of George Lucas naming conventions. One of the smugglers has a big white beard and a selection of slit visors. It's sort of Geordi La Forge trying to dress as Santa, but it's already Xmas eve and the only shop left open sells lumberjack supplies.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that many Star Wars races are extremely dodgy caricatures of non-white people, despite efforts to tidy away the stinker characterisations of the Phantom Menace era, and Quantic Dream are the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heavy-rain-detroit-become-human-and-beyond-two-souls-coming-to-pc">"a monstrously clumsy allegory for racism"</a>. I'm not sure I'd trust them with the Gungans.</p>
<p>There's still no release date for Eclipse. Earlier this year, Quantic Dream vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse commented that "one of the amazing things about working with NetEase is that they're not imposing release dates on us". I imagine another thing they're thankful for is that NetEase have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">so far spared Quantic Dream from any layoffs</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">wider cost-cutting</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Until Dawn is the latest video game to get itself a film adaptation, having made its cinematic debut on 25th April. At the film's close, its credits acknowledge the game it is inspired by, but no individual developer credits are highlighted.</p>
<p>Now, a former PlayStation narrative director has <a href="https://www.change.org/p/credit-the-until-dawn-game-creators">started a petition</a> "for the integrity of the Until Dawn creators", which they hope will see the film's credits updated so members of the original team "may be finally honoured".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the petition has 167 signatures.</p>

<p>"As a former Sony Interactive Entertainment and PlayStation narrative director who was firmly told that the IP I personally created would NEVER be credited to me as I was salaried (no royalties, no control, no ownership , no acknowledgement) I am struggling with the difference between [The Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann's favour and that of others in your company," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7321943561434796033?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7321943561434796033%2C7321958047344463872%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287321958047344463872%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7321943561434796033%29">Kim MacAskill wrote on LinkedIn</a> (please note, she is <em>not</em> talking about personally being a part of Until Dawn's creation, here).</p>
<p>"I've just left Until Dawn where the film director, writers etc were all credited but instead of you mentioning the leading game dev(s) who created this ICONIC game you're clearly proud of, you just wrapped it as 'based on the Sony game'."</p>
<p>MacAskill said members of the Until Dawn team had spent "years breaking their brains to make something incredible", and therefore "the world DESERVES to know their names" in the film's credits.</p>
<p>"Why should IP creators keep working for you? Film and TV, which is grotesque at the best of times, still own the need to note the importance of credit," MacAskill closed.</p>
<p>However, while there should absolutely be credit where credit is due, MacAskill fails to acknowledge that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-curious-about-how-people-will-react-to-season-2-as-elephant-in-the-room-is-dodged">Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann also works on The Last of Us TV show as a writer and director</a>. In Until Dawn's case, meanwhile, the game's writers were not approached to consult on the film, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">differs from the source material significantly</a>.</p>
<p>As for The Last of Us, the wider studio is credited under the banner that the show is based on the video game series.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/why-until-dawn-video-game-writers-arent-credited-on-the-movie/ar-AA1DD96a">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick - the pair who wrote 2015's Until Dawn video game release for PlayStation - have said they weren't surprised to see their names absent from the film's credits, and weren't seeking to be included now - although a nod would have been appreciated.</p>
<p>"I didn't assume anything, but I thought somebody would have bothered to throw in our names, even during the end credits," Fessenden said. "But there's no courtesy in show biz."</p>
<p>On this lack of credit, screenwriter and Writers Guild of America (WGA) member C. Robert Cargill - whose credits include 2016's Doctor Strange - pointed out this is common practice.</p>
<p>"This is one of those situations where credit is clear, but because the Guild doesn't know who to ascribe credit [for video games] in general, they don't have a hard and fast rule about how to do that," Cargill said.</p>
<p>"Technically, the studio's abiding by Guild rules."</p>

			<p>Music is often wrapped up in the waging of war, but that’s even more true in Unbeatable. Here, music has been banned, following an unspecified calamity that’s rendered tunes, tracks and songs enemy number one.</p>
<p>What better place than here to find that you’re in a band? Your group is fronted by Beat, the main character and lead vocalist, while you’ve got Quaver on guitar, Treble on keys and Clef nailing down the tempo on drums. For a world that’s banned music, it sure is obsessed with giving everyone musical names, huh?</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: GAMEPLAY TRAILER 2.0" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwKFOZeJukA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a big bad here, and it comes in the form of Harmony and Resonance Management. This corporate monolith is run by Rest, with her lackeys Apoco and Poco appearing at inopportune moments to channel the spirt of Team Rocket with a splash of Ryan and Sharpey from High School Musical. The mysterious Sforzando lurks at the end of a phone line, and they’re set on hunting down Beat and the gang for musical crimes against humanity. Or, something like that.</p>
<p>Unbeatable looks insanely good. Fusing comic book aesthetics with anime overtures, Unbeatable catches your eye, shoves it in its pocket, and refuses to return it. I’ve not stopped thinking about playing this game since I first saw it, and when those visuals are combined with rhythm action combat, it feels like a game designed to keep me up at night.</p>

<p>This isn’t some easy-going rhythm action either, and while Unbeatable’s demo gives you a rundown on how combat and music work, it then makes sure to shove you on stage with very little further preparation.</p>

<p>You’d think that a two-button rhythm action system would be basic, but in practice, it’s difficult to build up a streak as Unbeatable plays fast and loose with its mechanics, twisting them into a hybrid beat ‘em up that’s surprising and unique.</p>
<p>One button sees you leap into the air to attack the beats that sit there, or to dodge oncoming barriers. Meanwhile, the other keeps you more grounded, dealing with the beats on the lower level. At times you have to engage them at the same time, other band mates stepping in to help out, or hold one while tapping the other. If you’re given a police officer to deal with, there are points where you can mash the attack button until they drop, but only if you’ve hit the previous beats.</p>
<p>Rhythm action and music bleed into every aspect of the game, and besides the authoritarian police state, this is a glorious post-apocalyptic segue through musical interludes, gorgeous artwork and intriguing characters.</p>
<p>It’s tough though, and failing a musical battle may or may not see the narrative grind to a halt. If it doesn’t continue – your failure seemingly fitting into the story – it spits you back at the band’s headquarters and forces you to run all the way back to where you were. Hopefully, the dev team will add a retry option for the full release as that… well, makes a bit more sense. You don’t always take it from the top at band practice, after all!</p>

<p>Given the mechanical setup, storytelling feels like it’s going to be an aside, or an excuse to take you to the next musical number, but it’s absolutely not. Through our time with the demo, Unbeatable is nailing personal drama, wider conflicts and societal commentary with a surety I wasn’t expecting. It’s just immediately engaging, and so far, it’s proven to be an unexpected delight.</p>
<p>Unbeatable is shaping up to be a unique and genre-defying rhythm action game, combining compelling storytelling and tough musically-led combat. I can’t wait to discover more when it releases later in 2025.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, after largely praising the visuals and gameplay changes made by Virtuos, reviewer Francesco De Meo also noted that the performance was highly problematic:</p>
<p><em>The game runs pretty well in closed-off environments, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired in the open world. In two different benchmarking sessions, held in the sewers during The Path of Dawn quest to meet with the Sponsor to obtain the Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4 book, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode, Frame Generation Hardware Lumen and every setting at high, the game ran at an average of 141 FPS, 24 1% low, with minimal stuttering that did not impact the experience a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>In the open world, however, things are quite different, as the game ran at an average of 107 FPS, 15 1% low with frequent stuttering. My system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) should be more than capable of handling Oblivion Remastered well, at least based on the system requirements, so it's clear that more work is needed on the optimization front.</em></p>
<p>I experienced the same even on my more powerful rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5090). While the game runs smoothly in closed off areas, open areas and especially the open world are close to a stutter-fest.</p>
<p>The folks at Digital Foundry agree, too. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0rCA1vpgSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC video report</a>, published over the weekend, praised the remaster's visuals but cited 'dire performance problems'.</p>
<p><iframe title="Oblivion Remastered PC: Impressive Remastering, Dire Performance Problems" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0rCA1vpgSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia noted that history repeats itself, as constant hitches in the open world also plagued the original Oblivion. Even a lower frame rate cap to 60 FPS cannot really fix the issue. While hitches are very bad on the most powerful CPU available on the market, they're much worse on lower end CPUs. For example, the Ryzen 5 3600 exhibits 2 to 2 and a half longer hitches compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in DF's testing.</p>
<p>The only real way to slightly improve the stuttering/hitching issue is to disable hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination. Unfortunately, this also brings a noticeable reduction in visual quality, especially when it comes to water reflections, ambient shadowing and lighting. Needless to say, the only real fixes can come with an official patch from Virtuos. We'll keep you updated on any such enhancements, of course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed four million players</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-to-parry-consistently/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-%E2%80%93-how-to-parry-consistently.1175151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-to-parry-consistently/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features a lot of familiar role-playing game turn-based combat mechanics, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive twists them in some interesting ways to give players something else to do other than picking commands and watching characters carry them out. During both the offense and defensive phases, you will have to complete some straightforward quick-time events that increase the power of your attacks and completely negate damage from enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Completing these QTEs for attacks, however, is considerably easier than doing the same when defending against enemy attacks in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And significantly less important as well. While losing some damage is, ultimately, no big deal, missing a parry or a dodge often means the targeted character will eat a lot of damage, making combat feel more frustrating and considerably less fun than it actually is.</p>
<p><strong>Learning to parry and dodge consistently in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 requires you to do away with any preconception you may have regarding timing</strong>. If you're a big action game fan who has completed challenging parry-based games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you will learn straight from the first training duel against Maelle that the timing for parries in the game is very different from that of action games. Instinctively, the first few times, you will press the parry button right as the attack is about to connect with your character, but that will not work.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250427172317_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before you even attempt learning to parry in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, you should focus on <strong>dodging</strong> first. The timing for dodges is considerably less strict than for parries, thus you will be able to pull them off more easily. At the same time, dodging will give you a better feel for the correct timing, and when you start pulling off perfect dodges, you will be ready for parries, as the timing for perfect dodges is the same as parries.</p>
<p>The secret to learning how to parry consistently in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is understanding how they work. Think of parries as putting up a barrier or a shield for a few seconds. It takes some time to bring them up. As such, parries are not active from the first frame of animation and require a moment before they become active.<strong> For parries to be successful, the enemy attack has to connect with the "shield" the character puts up after pressing the parry button, so you need to take the time it takes to put it up into account.</strong></p>
<p>Judging from how parries work in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and how enemies often delay their attacks sometimes in an unnatural way, it's clear that the developer didn't intend for <strong>parries to be a defensive option that can be thrown out carelessly</strong>. Once you've got the general idea of the timing, you will need to practice a lot with each new enemy and learn which visual or sound cue can help you time the parry. Throughout the adventure, doing all this will eventually become natural, making fighting enemies in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 considerably more enjoyable.</p>

            <p>Hello and good New Week to ye, traveller! And my, my - what a New Week it is. We're taking the desperate toil of feeding the Maw to strange new places. I'll spell that out in a separate post to come, once I've caught up on emails during my absence last week and in general, remembered how to do my job, but you may already notice certain sinister adjustments to the format. I welcome any feedback and wanton abuse. In the meantime, here are some new PC games. </p>
<p>It's a quieter one, after Obliviongate last week, but there are some standouts. Monday 28th April brings the programmable robot block building of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2613890/Icaria/">Icaria</a> - the kind of game I enjoy hearing about but will never muster the neurones to play. Tuesday 29th April? I will delicately avoid Tuesday 29th because Tuesdays are overrated and it's high time somebody said it. Nothing useful, beautiful or truthful ever happens on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th April is a day of meaty tribulations, thanks to Slavic manko-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moroi">Moroi</a>... and of joyful spacecat salvation, thanks to immersive sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. On Thursday 1st May, another unusual pairing: Ecuadorian slice-of-life soccer adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, and Lovecraftian house mystery <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-horror-at-highrook">The Horror At Highrook</a>. And on Friday 2nd May, it's time for no-roles naval MOBA <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/">Sirocco</a>. I haven't played an actual, undiluted MOBA in years. This one has galleons, which might be enough to reel me in.</p>
<p>What's on the news agenda this week? Probably a fair bit more about the Oblivion remaster, which is exasperating young people who haven't quite clocked that it's still an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from 2006, with none of the modcons you'd expect from, I don't know, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. We'll also be taking a closer look at Skin Deep and The Horror At Highrook. Beyond that, I've got my eternally uncleansable backlog of interview-based features to pick at. Seen a game or topic we should cover? Please avail yourself of our comments thread below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">my review</a> of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, you'll know I loved it. It's pretty handily my game of the year so far, and an all-timer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> besides. It's a hugely impressive piece of game magic, and I'm certainly not trying to diminish that.</p>
<p>However, the culture being what it is, I keep seeing the game's quality weaponised against the state of game development in general. Even celebrations are often accompanied by some variation on the phrase "<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/speechless-clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-game-from-a-studio-filled-with-ex-ubisoft-devs-is-officially-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/">made</a> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/clair-obscur-expedition-33-doubles-its-sales-now-sold-1-million-units">by</a> <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller-1534943/">just</a> <a href="https://fandomwire.com/its-the-scene-where-the-four-main-characters-are-clair-obscur-expedition-33-owes-its-entire-existence-to-a-final-fantasy-xv-scene/">30</a> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-massive-success-player-count-over-100k">developers</a>". It's good to be impressed by things! I was impressed too. And I generally agree with the sentiment that game development has become untenably bloated. It's a very tasty narrative, but the figures are a bit sloppy. No need to listen to me, anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/04wAYTaqNkI">The credits are actually very easy to find</a>.</p>

<p>In brief: Sandfall themselves are, indeed, around 30 people. I counted maybe 34 but there's a few people pulling dual roles across writing, quest design, and so on. That's amazing, no doubt. The story starts to look a bit different, however, once the bulk of the credits begin to roll.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's the eight-person Korean 'gameplay animation' team. If you've played any of Clair Obscur, you'll know how vital animations are to its combat. Monsters feint and twirl in battle, pulling off elaborate combos that you'll need to parry and dodge. While we don't know specifically what 'gameplay animation' refers to, the only comparable discipline in-house on Sandfall's side is 'cinematic and performance capture'. So, I'm left to conclude that this Korean team are effectively responsible for a large part of why combat is fun in the first place, and a fair chunk of the game's personality besides.</p>
<p>To those eight animators, add the dozens on dozens of people that worked on localisation, QA, and voice production work. And then there are the 30-plus musicians that worked on the soundtrack, including a nine person choir. As far as the in-house Sandfall credits for music go, only lead composer Lorien Testard, three vocalists, and the audio and music lead designer are listed. Again: I'm absolutely not suggesting Sandfall or anyone else is telling porkies or burying talent here. I only bring this up to say that, even just accounting for the music that's so vital to Clair Obscur's essence as a work, we can effectively double that '30 people' narrative.</p>
<p>I'm conscious that this all reflects a tendency in UK and US reporting to minimise contributions from outsourced workers and support studios in East Asia and elsewhere. In many ways, this is playing right into the industry's preferred narrative. A few years back, People Make Games reported on the AAA industry's habit of "<a href="https://youtu.be/bm7KUE1Kwts">buying crunch overseas". </a>I'm not suggesting Sandfall themselves are doing anything like this, of course  - evidence points to the contrary, in fact. And in many cases, news writers on a time crunch are simply repeating whatever line has been accepted as common wisdom, rather than deliberately obfuscating the reality. I can understand why these catchy claims spread so quickly.</p>
<p>Once more: if Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was made by 500 people, it'd still be an incredible work. It has the good game sauce, and clearly came from a place of love, inspiration, and the desire to tell a story. Doing math equations with talent and resources is a phenomenally boring way to judge art. But celebrating the wrong things - or the right thing with the wrong information -  always feels a bit hollow to me. So, don't skip the credits.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a fantasy setting packed with enough quests to keep even the most dedicated adventurer busy for hundreds of hours. But that hasn’t stopped some from probing the invisible barrier of its border for cracks — and even exploring the regions beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7qy1r/apparently_you_can_just_leave_cyrodiil/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor GnoblinXD recounted their journey through Cyrodiil’s border and into Valenwood</a>, Tamriel’s southwestern province and home to the Bosmer, or Wood Elves, and next door Elsweyr, a region featured in The Elder Scrolls Online. GnoblinXD found they were able to move through the invisible barrier set in place to prevent this sort of thing, and, from there, simply jumped their way across the river and up the cliff face in classic The Elder Scrolls fashion.</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="546" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7qy1r/apparently_you_can_just_leave_cyrodiil/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oblivion</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I explored a bit and was surprised to find basically the whole landmass of the map was there, even if not detailed ofc,” GnoblinXD said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valenwood itself is a barren area, devoid of life, cities, NPCs, or even trees. There are a number of graphics and environmental issues GnoblinXD ran into while exploring here, which you’d expect given the developers of Oblivion Remastered never intended it to be explored in the first place. GnoblinXD tried to reach what they believe to be the Summerset Isles west of Valenwood, but fell afoul of the void. Reloading from saves set outside the bounds of Cyrodiil do not appear to work, forcing GnoblinXD to restart inside its borders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want details, GnoblinXD uploaded a video, below, showing exactly how to get into Valenwood via this new border-breaking discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undeterred, GnoblinXD later uploaded images of their journey to Hammerfell, the province in the west of Tamriel rumored to be the setting of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has remained tight-lipped on where the next brand new The Elder Scrolls game will take place. All we have to go on is the game’s 36-second announcement teaser, which presents a towering stretch of mountains and a picturesque coastline overlooking a vast ocean. The prevailing theory is that the sequel will let players loose in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/14/e3-2018-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-might-be-set-in-familiar-grounds"><u>Hammerfell</u></a> – the central setting of The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall and The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, as well as a visitable location in The Elder Scrolls Online. With tropical forests, harsh mountains and scenic coastal cities, Hammerfell’s depictions in previous Elder Scrolls games seem to align with the teaser, hinting that we may be set to explore the Redguards’ homeland once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get to Hammerfell, GnoblinXD passed the southern Valenwood gap and walked around the port city of Anvil, the westernmost city in Cyrodiil, and up towards Hammerfell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After many an hour spent searching, I finally found my way to the other side of Cyrodiil's northern border!” GnoblinXD said. “The region seems vast. Much bigger than the Valenwood/Elsweyr area. The landmass stretches way beyond render-distance, so who knows how far it goes... Likely there is nothing here, but I'm intrigued nonetheless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now here’s where things get really interesting. GnoblinXD tried to find the coastline from the The Elder Scrolls VI teaser, walking west towards where that area would be in-game, but ended up falling off the edge of the map (“I didn't die, but now I'm stuck in the backrooms of Oblivion, lol.”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps GnoblinXD will eventually be able to find that area, or perhaps another player will manage it. Either way, the challenge is set for a glimpse at what may end up being the setting of one of the most-anticipated video games ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got here using no mods, glitches or console commands, my game is entirely vanilla,” GnoblinXD insisted. “Oh, and it's kind of funny that Hammerfell seems thoroughly covered in forests while Valenwood had no trees at all, lol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyway, time for me to do some exploring, might update more later :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so they did, this time pictures of a journey into the aforementioned Elsweyr. Elsweyr is of course home to the Khajiit, the playable bestial and feline race feature in all the main The Elder Scrolls games so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s brilliant about this out of bounds area is that from within it you can see what very much looks like The Throat of the World, the highest mountain of Tamriel and perhaps the most iconic location in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It is here that the Dragonborn climbs the Seven Thousand Steps to the ancient monastery of High Hrothgar, where the order of the Greybeards dwells, and learns from them Shouts and speaks with the dragon, Paarthurnax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, you can go to Skyrim in Oblivion Remastered, but you can't actually travel far enough in to get to The Throat of the World or see any sign of life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so cool. If you go to the edge of the map in Oblivion Remastered, you can see Skyrim’s tallest mountain, The Throat of the World, off in the distance. This was not in the original game <a href="https://t.co/oilOVpeuXF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oilOVpeuXF</a></p>— sackchief 🍂 (@sackchief) <a href="https://twitter.com/sackchief/status/1915267907178713412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Much like Valenwood, Elsweyr is quite barren once you leave the border area with Cyrodiil,” GnoblinXD explained. “Unlike Valenwood, however, I suppose the lack of flora and fauna is somewhat more lore-accurate. With that said I found neither cats nor deserts, unfortunately, and most heartbreaking of all, no Moon Sugar :(</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I ran around a bit looking for anything of interest, taking some pictures along the way. I decided to see how far south you could go. Well, it turns out you can go quite far. After reaching and going beyond the southern edge of Elsweyr, there seemed only to be endless sea, so I decided to head east towards Black Marsh instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And, oh boy, Black Marsh is definitely... uh... Unique, let's say. I might make a post about it at some point if people want to see. I didn't see how far east I could go, but very interestingly there is a HUGE landmass beyond the far eastern edge of the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GnoblinXD is still mid-journey outside Cyrodiil, and may uncover even more areas to explore and famous landmarks looming over the horizon. They managed to find their way to both the Morrowind and Skyrim side of the border, but the walkable area doesn’t extend far. “So no selfies from the Throat of The World, unfortunately :(“ GnoblinXD said. However, after their initial post blew up on reddit (19,000 upvotes and counting), it seems others may make discoveries of their own. And so it has proven.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition has been beaten by a player with early access to the company's unreleased console.
</p>
<p>
Japanese speedrunner Ikaboze recently attended one of Nintendo's Switch 2 hands-on events, held in Tokyo, and used his familiarity with the game to beat Ganon with no fancy equipment (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/japanese-speedrunner-has-beaten-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Insider</a>).
</p>
<p>
Ikaboze had just 20 minutes to complete the feat, before his alloted time with the demo expired. Using a save file from outside Hyrule Castle, Ikaboze needed less than half that time to reach the game's end credits.
</p>
<p>
Watch Ikaboze battle his way through Hyrule Castle and ditch all of his main equipment before taking on Ganon:

			<p>Sandfall Interactive proudly <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> an important sales milestone for its debut game, the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over half a million units in the first day alone, and after three days, it has become a million-seller.&nbsp;This is particularly relevant because it's in addition to the game being available on Game Pass, which undoubtedly reduces full-game sales on PC and Xbox.&nbsp;Given that this is not a triple-A budget game, it's possible that the game could be close to breaking even.</p>
<p>Critic and user reviews so far are also excellent, with many already pitching Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Indeed, from the very announcement, the game immediately looked exciting. The blend of a fantasy setting inspired by Belle Époque France with the plot twist of a seemingly all-powerful being condemning an entire year class to death was powerful. Similarly, on the gameplay side, the game mixes classic turn-based JRPG action with real-time elements powered by Quick-Time events for dodges and parries, for example. There are also renowned actors and voice actors such as Andy Serkis, Charlie Cox, Ben Starr, and Jennifer English leading their performances to the cast of main characters.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game has relatively low system requirements, but those who don't meet them can play it anyway via NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud platform. NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution is natively supported, while Frame Generation is only available via a PureDark mod <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/clair-obscur-33-127531080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released exclusively to the modder's Patreon subscribers</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech only got access to the game on launch day, so our review is still being worked on and will come later this week. Meanwhile, if you've been playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, what are your impressions so far? Let us know in the comments section.</p>
