		<p>In July remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2 were leaked by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-leaked-by-merch/">a statue at Comicon of all things</a> and the games have now popped up in back end of the PlayStation Store, presumably ahead of a reveal in tonight’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-is-taking-place-tomorrow-september-24th-confirms-sony/">State of Play.&nbsp;</a>You can ever watch the trailer, which is nice.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-453250-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Here’s the blurb from the website</p>


<div>
<p>Celebrate Soul Reaver’s 25th Anniversary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience the epic conflict of Kain and Raziel in original form or with remastered graphics. Included Game Titles: Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2</li>
<li>Experience the Legendary Narrative: Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.</li>
<li>Wield the Powers of a Wraith: Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.</li>
<li>Shift Between Realms: The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the remastered graphics are, well, nicer than the original, but it doesn’t look the polygon count has been increased that much and the lighting, effects and animation still look very similar to original game.</p>


</div>

<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig.</p>
<p>Two of the games in the series were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-return-but-probably-not-in-the-way-you-wanted/">recently announced for the Evercade console.&nbsp;</a> Soul Reaver and Blood Omen are direct ports of the original titles without any new features and were released this month for the princely sum of £24.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-via-psn-listing.990042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A now-deleted PlayStation Store listing has apparently confirmed the existence of remastered versions of the first two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1838560114745172409" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to a PSN listing quoted by Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the remastered package, which is being developed by Aspyr, will contain&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver 2</em>. The bundle will launch on December 10th as part of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The PSN listing says that you'll be able to play both games either with their original graphics intact or with "remastered graphics", presumably akin to those found in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>, which were also handled by Aspyr.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=FTkys8QX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=zZV4WNp3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like those&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters are pretty much a certainty now.</figcaption></figure><p>From the sound of the leaked trailer, it seems as though the remasters will keep the superb voice work of Michael Bell, Simon Templeman, and Tony Jay (voicing Raziel, Kain, and the Elder God respectively) intact.</p>
<p>The PSN listing doesn't make any reference to Aspyr putting any content that was cut from the original games back in, but the trailer seems to show some things that weren't in the original games, so we'll have to wait and see if the developer's plans extend that far.</p>
<p>The existence of these&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters was first leaked as part of merchandise that was available at this year's Comic-Con; cards bearing text referring to the remasters were spotted at the show.</p>
<p>Additionally, a&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>prequel graphic novel that tells the story of the events leading up to the original&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was recently Kickstarted</a>, so these remasters are part of what appears to be a wider revival for the property.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-altar.jpg?itok=-hPufzmO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-altar.jpg?itok=IU6KDJof 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soul Reaver 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a remaster as well.</figcaption></figure><p>It's likely that the&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters will be announced during <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1838254671456018525" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today's PlayStation State of Play showcase</a>, which is due to air at 6pm Eastern (that's 3pm Pacific). Stay tuned for more on that and all things&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>.</p>

SteelSeries is upgrading its Hall effect switches, adding dampening foam, improving its switch stabilizers, and even factory lubricating each key in an effort to create a thockier sounding board.</p><p>SteelSeries is moving to new OmniPoint 3.0 switches on the Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup, which includes a full-size board and TKL (tenkeyless) wired and TKL wireless variants. SteelSeries says it’s the “most technically advanced switch on the market,” and it has improved sensors that are designed to reduce noise.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes a full-size option.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>Hall effect gaming keyboards are increasingly becoming popular because they allow gamers to adjust actuation points from 4mm down to just 0.1mm. Traditional Cherry MX-style switches use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm, but Hall effect switches use a magnet instead to speed up keypresses.</p><p>These magnetic switches also enable features like Rapid Trigger, the ability to press the same key without waiting for it to return. SteelSeries is offering both Rapid Trigger and Rapid Tap, its own take on Razer’s controversial Snap Tap mode. It allows you to perfectly counter-strafe in games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">Valve recently banned</a> similar features from Razer and Wooting.</p><div><figcaption><em>SteelSeries is using dampening foam to improve the sound and feel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>SteelSeries has also improved its stabilizers to eliminate keycap wobble, so both the switches and stabilizers should reduce the overall rattling sound you can often find on Hall effect boards.&nbsp;SteelSeries has also added three layers of sound dampening foam to improve the sound and feel, alongside per key lubrication. SteelSeries is using Poron and silicone rubber here, but we’ll have to try out the boards to see how much of a difference it all makes.</p><p>It wouldn’t be a SteelSeries keyboard without some interesting software features. The new OmniPoint 3.0 switches also allow for 2-in-1 action keypresses, allowing you to combine two actions into a single keystroke. You could walk and then run, pull a grenade out and then throw it, or execute combos. It’s essentially a macro mode for your keyboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes the OLED smart display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>GG Quickset is also available on these boards, which lets you use presets for games much like SteelSeries does for the audio settings of its headsets. SteelSeries has also added a protection mode, so you can lock keys against accidental fat fingering. </p><p>The Apex Pro Gen 3 also continues the tradition of the OLED smart display at the top of the keyboard, which allows for the adjustment of settings and profile changes or just a handy way to see your CPU and GPU usage.</p><p>The $199.99 Apex Pro Gen 3, $189.99 Apex Pro TKL Gen 3, and $249.99 Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3&nbsp;are all available today from retailers worldwide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These apparitions and portents, Crystal Dynamics - what game are you playing now? It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remasters-on-horizon-if-a-comic-con-plaque-is-to-be-believed">rumoured earlier this year</a>, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website. 
</p>

<p>
All this comes care of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/">Resetera</a>. My initial reaction to the screens is a hot blend of enthusiasm - because the first Soul Reaver is one of the most treasured games of my childhood - and revulsion - because they've properly given this one the Vaseline treatment, and turned all those gloriously grotty PS1 textures and contours into slick Bluepointy figurines that look clean enough to eat off.</p>
<p>"Ghastly past, insufferable future - are they one and the same?" intones Ariel, wraithlike prisoner of the corrupted Pillars of Nosgoth, in an early scene. No, Ariel, they are not the same at all, because I can see my farkin' face reflected in nu-Raziel's grossly protruding ribcage, and what have they done to Dumah? He used to be a tragical hummock of biomechanical hinges and soupy pixellation, the lowest-born of Kain's children fallen even deeper into ruin. Now, he just looks like a midboss from Doom Eternal.

"What have you done with my clan, degenerate?" I cry out unto apparent co-developers Aspyr through the amber prisms of the internet. "You have no right!"</p>
<p>"Oh quit whining, you old goat," you interject. "I didn't play Soul Reaver back in the day and I don't understand any of the references you're dropping and I don't want to play this while feeling as though I'm eyeballing a plate of rotten porridge."</p>
<p>"Look what they've done to the plane-shifting effects," I beseech, ripping at my clothes in a frenzy. "They used to be miracles on PS1, twisting the geometry in such a way as to suggest two worlds without actually building them. Now it just looks like effing screen-tearing."</p>
<p>"What would you know about the ins and outs of remastering classic games?" you sneer. "Only when you have felt the full gravity of choice should you dare to question their judgment."</p>
<p>"That's a line from Soul Reaver!" I squeal, pointing a shaking finger. "This whole exchange is a rhetorical farce!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, it just came to me on the spur of the moment," you sniff. "And anyway, I'm not going to sit here and bandy words with some so-called 'journalist' who never even played the original Blood Omen games. I'm going to read this here set of leaked bulletpoints instead."
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Experience the Legendary Narrative
</p>
<p>
Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.
</p>
<p>
Wield the Powers of a Wraith. 
</p>
<p>
Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.
</p>
<p>
Shift Between Realms.
</p>
<p>
 The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.</p> </blockquote>
<p>One thing they haven't (it seems) meddled with is the voice-acting, and I am sagging with relief, because come on, show me a modern-day game that can chew scenery like Soul Reaver can. I can only think of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battleblock-theater">Battleblock Theater</a> and that came out over a decade later.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Elder Gods at Sony will hopefully be along with a proper announcement at some point soon. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">a link to the trailer</a> which may have been taken down by the time you read this. I think that, on the whole, the balance of enthusiasm and revulsion in my head tips in the direction of the former, because look, here I am writing about Soul Reaver again in the year 2024, and besides, it <em>might</em> lead to the creation of new Legacy Of Kain games. Perhaps they could plunder the crypt of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-dead-sun">Dead Sun</a>.

<p>Ubisoft has cancelled its scheduled appearance at Tokyo Game Show, just two days before the event is set to get underway.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released</a> by Ubisoft Japan, the company says the decision was made due to “various circumstances”.</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.  </p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company did say that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” will continue despite the broadcast no longer happening. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s pulling out of the event comes during a time of turmoil for the company. While the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows releases in November, the company has been feeling pressure from other areas. </p>



<p>First, there is the concern about the state of XDefiant where, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims to the contrary</a>, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in real trouble due to</a> falling player numbers. Then there is the continuous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-price-falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling of stock prices</a> as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from at least one investor</a> to make executive changes and take the company private.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made multiple attempts to contact Ubisoft for more clarification on the “various circumstances” claim. As of publishing, however, a response was not received.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 10am ET</strong>: Ubisoft has told Insider Gaming that they have “No Comment” on the cancellation.</p>

One of the new features in the game will be a base-building mode, allowing players to construct their very own headquarters and customize it to their needs.</p><p>In a video that was uploaded by <a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN China</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-sim-like-base-building-where-you-manually-place-houses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and has since been removed, Ubisoft described how players will have an acre of land to establish their base on. The mode doesn't look too complex, as you can easily place buildings and paths on it, rotating and customizing them for when the game's protagonists Yasuke and Naoe need a moment of respite.</p>

                <p>2025 is going to be a big year for Minecraft fans. Not only does the Minecraft movie finally premiere on April 4, 2025, but Dark Horse Comics just announced a new Minecraft graphic novel, Minecraft: Out of Order, which will also launch in early 2025. Minecraft: Out of Order is an original story written and illustrated by cartoonish Josh Hicks, whose previous works include other graphic novels like Glorious Wrestling Alliance and Hotelitor: Luxury-Class Defense, as well as the animated short Spectre of the Bear. While it's not directly tied to the Minecraft movie, the first volume of Minecraft: Out of Order launches a few weeks ahead of the film on March 18, 2025, and fans can preorder the graphic novel now.</p><div title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2684" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Minecraft: Out of Order Volume 1</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Minecraft: Out of Order follows Riley, a farmer who lives a quiet life in the countryside until their town is demolished and turned into building materials by the Province of Perfect Sameness--an evil kingdom led by identical twins Paula and Prentice who seek to impose "perfect sameness" on the whole world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-laden-holy-horror-mansion-announced-by-professor-layton-developer-level-5-coming-to-secret-platforms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Level-5 has revealed its "heartwarming" Ghost Craft RPG called Holy Horror Mansion, which the company describes as the "next concept for Yo-kai Watch".</p>
<p>The release platforms for the game have been described as "secret". Considering Level-5's support for Nintendo consoles, it seems likely the game will eventually make its way onto Nintendo's next, yet-to-be revealed console, tentatively dubbed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Holy Horror Mansion was announced during Level-5's Vision broadcast, which it hosted earlier today. Along with updates on the likes of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time (which now has an April 2025 release window), Level-5 also gave us a first look at what it calls its largest cross-media project to date.</p>

<p>Holy Horror Mansion looks to be a bombastic evolution on Yo-kai Watch. It features a young boy named Ten Lordland who lives in a large apartment building which happens to be a gate to the underworld. He finds a mysterious camera within the building, which does something strange to one of his nose hairs. Cue plenty of spectral beings and ghostly shenanigans (see above).</p>
<p>During the presentation, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino said the theme for Holy Horror Mansion is "family", and the team hopes the whole family can and will enjoy it. He also said a showcase for the project will take place in the spring of next year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>And, that is about all the information we have on the upcoming ghost game for now. Its release date is simply said to be "not sure" but maybe "soon", while its price will be "fair".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make an announcement about the successor to the Switch "within this fiscal year"</a>. We'll at least learn more official news of Switch 2 before 31st March, then.</p>
<p>Unofficially, a major leak earlier this month of what seemed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">prototype components for the upcoming console</a> gave us an idea of the form the machine may actually take.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-wont-be-available-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-won%E2%80%99t-be-available-before-launch.989982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-review-codes-wont-be-available-before-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Don't expect to find reviews for Starfield: Shattered Space when the sci-fi action RPG's first expansion launches on September 30. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danstapleton.bsky.social/post/3l4tkqhestp2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN's Dan Stapleton</a>, review codes won't be released to any member of the press or any content creator ahead of that date.</p>
<p>Usually, this would cause some concern about the expansion's quality, but Bethesda is not new to such practices. For example, 2016's DOOM reboot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-review-codes-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not offer review codes before launch</a>, which was an excellent game. It earned an 8.6 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech from Dave Aubrey</a> and sold millions of copies, securing the development of DOOM Eternal (also a great title, by the way).</p>
<p><em>So, is DOOM worthwhile? Well, if you’re the kind of gamer who wants a brilliant 10-14 hour campaign where you’ll shoot and listen to metal breakdowns, then yes, 100%. DOOM in 2016 is possibly the best single player experience you can have with an FPS on modern consoles and for that alone, it is deserving of praise. Oh, and also you don’t aim down sights. That’s probably the best part of it all, actually.</em></p>
<p>Whether Starfield: Shattered Space will be as successful remains to be seen, but fans can stay hopeful for now. So far, Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-gets-official-deep-dive-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> all the right things, claiming that it will be a return to the studio's traditional form of exploration focused on a single environment rather than countless planets.</p>
<p><em>We love Starfield's massive open galaxy, but from early on in our planning, we knew we wanted to introduce some more secluded and handcrafted locations, similar to what you've seen from our past expansions. There's so much mystery to House Va'ruun, and because they've so thoroughly isolated themselves, it made them the perfect faction to explore in a completely self-contained experience.</em></p>
<p><em>From the minute you arrive on Va'ruun'kai, the story never sends you off-planet. You're free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va'ruun homeworld. Everything you discover, every location you visit, every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here and how the Va'ruun people have survived being cut off from the comforts of the Settled Systems and the rest of humanity.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Level-5's Woes Continue with Huge Decapolice Delay to 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-decapolice-delay-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-5s-woes-continue-with-huge-decapolice-delay-to-2026.989979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-decapolice-delay-2026<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced a massive delay to its investigative JRPG&nbsp;<em>Decapolice</em>, with the game now not scheduled to arrive for a good couple of years.</p>
<p>Per a new trailer shown during today's Level-5 Vision 2024 showcase,&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>is now scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026, which represents a huge push back for the game given that it was originally planned for launch sometime this year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also isn't the first delay&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>has suffered. Originally, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-reveals-new-decapolice-trailers-showing-features-gameplay">scheduled for launch in 2023</a>&nbsp;before being delayed to 2024, so it's unfortunate that Level-5 has had to delay the game once again, although this hopefully means we'll get a better game when it's released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/decapolice-delay-level-5-gameplay.jpg?itok=PA_-oDS1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/decapolice-delay-level-5-gameplay.jpg?itok=I6iXRUEf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>won't be arriving for another couple of years yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>delay comes at a particularly bad time for Level-5. Last month, the company announced that its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely">had been delayed indefinitely</a> (although there's some good news on that front today).</p>
<p>That delay itself comes after Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-vision-ii-showcase">announced in November last year</a> that projects originally planned for release in 2023 had to be pushed back to 2024, and it's likely that some of those games now won't see the light of day until next year or 2026 as well.</p>
<p>There is a small ray of light if you're waiting for <i>Decapolice&nbsp;</i>to arrive, though; Level-5 confirmed today that the game will be getting a PC release in addition to hitting PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<h2>Other announcements during today's Level-5 showcase</h2>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Decapolice&nbsp;</em>delay that was announced during today's Level-5 showcase, though, and some of the other reveals during the show could give some more hope to Level-5 fans.</p>
<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, for instance, is now slated for an April 2025 release. Of course, there's every chance that Level-5 will delay the game again before it sees the light of day, but let's hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company announced a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven</em>, titled&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven RE</em>. It's currently in development for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, although it's probably still pretty early on in development right now.</p>
<p>The remake should make a nice companion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-beta-release-date">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></a>, which will serve as the next mainline title in the long-running soccer RPG series.</p>

With three boss fights against the Benevodons down and only five to go, you can choose to take on the next four elemental demons in any order you like. It’s a vaguely <em>Mega Man</em> style structure, since each boss will unlock valuable upgrades for your party that will help subsequent bosses go down easier. But that’s information you’d only know <em>after</em> fighting these bosses.

These bosses and their respective dungeons will scale in level with you, so you won’t get in over your head by picking the “wrong” Benevodon first. That said, you will be locked in to whichever Benevodon you choose until you defeat it, so you can’t change your mind and chase down another Benevodon if one dungeon is giving you trouble. While Chapter Seven is one of the longer chapters in the game, each of these dungeons isn’t terribly time consuming on its own. You’ll be back to riding on Flammie and picking your next opponent to fight before you know it.</p><p><strong>That said, if you’re looking to optimize your progression, you <em>should</em> pick certain Benevodons to defeat over others.</strong> Read on for all the details explaining why that is.</p><h2 id="h120500"><a id=""></a><strong>Each Benevodon will unlock the next tier of each characters’ Elemental Plots</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-recommend-id="image://bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-recommend-id="image://bab52c2734ffda5b930fab2ff73b11e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our character looks into a chest full of gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Looking at the four elemental Benevodons you can pick, you may have noticed that your choices all correspond to the places where you first encountered each of your party members. This is no coincidence. Once you pick a Benevodon, you’ll also see the resolution of that corresponding character’s personal story arc. Additionally, upon defeating the Benevodon, you’ll receive a valuable Tonic that unlocks that character’s third tier of their Elemental Plot. You’ll also find a Chalice to increase how many Ability Seeds that character can equip.</p><p>To say the obvious, this means you’ll want to prioritize whichever character you use the most. Here’s where you’ll want to go to upgrade each character:</p><p><strong>Careena</strong> - Longren, the Vale of Wind</p><p><strong>Morley</strong> - Etaern, the Moonlit Parish</p><p><strong>Palamena</strong> - Illystana, Capital of the Deep</p><p><strong>Julei</strong> - Sanctuary of Mana</p><p>Don’t worry, Val doesn’t get left out of this equation. His story comes after all the above story arcs have been resolved. He’ll also receive his Tonic before you clear Chapter Seven.</p><h2 id="h120501"><a id=""></a><strong>There are a few other factors that might influence your first Benevodon, too.</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-recommend-id="image://36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-recommend-id="image://36d932f81974ecfb220e580208807ad3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Biffing some crab baddies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You presumably use at least two of the four characters listed above, but are there any other factors to help narrow down your choice? Yes, in fact! Here are a few observations I recorded throughout Chapter Seven.</p><p><strong>1:</strong> After completing the story arc in Etaern, you’ll unlock a new suite of shop vendors. Here you can purchase some new weapons and armor, all of which will help you throughout the rest of Chapter Seven. Morley is arguably the strongest character in the game thanks to the sheer power of his Nightblade class, so I’d rank this as the best starting point overall.</p><p><strong>2:</strong> In the Sanctuary of Mana, you’ll find chalices for both Julei <em>and</em> Val, granting both characters extra Ability Seed slots. If you’re using both Julei and Val, make this your first or second stop. If you don’t use Julei but still use Val, you should probably make this the third stop on your list.</p><p><strong>3:</strong> When visiting Illystana, one battle arena in this section’s corresponding dungeon did <em>not</em> level scale up for me when I encountered it. This frankly could be a glitch, but if not, this location may be <em>slightly</em> easier if you save it for later. I hardly think this should matter in your decision making process, but I’m not here to withhold information from you!</p><p>Again, there’s no real <em>wrong</em> order to complete Chapter Seven in—you’ll hit all these locations before the end of it. It’s all about finding the <em>right</em> order that works best for you, and the party you’re using.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind Dead by Daylight, <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that it has purchased Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios. </p>



<p>The acquisition was for an undisclosed amount.</p>



<p>“”It’s a privilege to welcome a developer of Red Hook’s calibre,” Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine said in a statement. “Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher – to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games. </p>



<p>“Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come.”</p>



<p>As part of the deal, all 29 members of Red Hook Studios will be kept with the company. The plan, as of now, is also for Red Hook to work independently under Behaviour Interactive.</p>



<p>Said Red Hook Studios co-founder Tyler Sigman, “Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels. They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news of the acquisition comes just a week after Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-cancelled-due-to-poor-reception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Dead by Daylight spinoff Project T</a> and s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behaviour-shuts-down-midwinter-entertainment-after-project-t-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hut down Midwinter Entertainment</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resigns-from-the-company-report/1100-6526463/">Annapurna Interactive lost the entirety of its staff</a> after all 25 members collectively resigned and walked out. The news came as a shock to some, as Annapurna has published a number of highly praised games (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stray/">Stray</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/outer-wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-artful-escape/">The Artful Escape</a>) and is currently in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-runner-2033-labyrinth-coming-from-annapurna/1100-6515572/">developing a Blade Runner game</a>. So what happened?</p><p dir="ltr">A recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation" rel="nofollow ">report from IGN</a> sheds some light on the issue. According to the report, changes in leadership played a major role, but the tale leading up to the mass walkout is a complicated one that requires a quick history lesson on the company's past to truly understand.</p><p dir="ltr">Annapurna Interactive was founded by Annapurna Pictures owner (and daughter of billionaire Larry Ellison) Megan Ellison in 2016. At the time, Annapurna Pictures was struggling financially, and Ellison handpicked ​Nathan Gary, Deborah Mars, and Hector Sanchez--who had all previously worked for Sony--to help guide the new gaming studio's path forward. Sanchez left the team in 2019, and Capybara Games co-founder Nathan Vella joined the team shortly thereafter. 2019 also saw <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" rel="nofollow ">Ellison effectively disappear</a>, effectively leaving Annapurna Interactive to its own devices, but the billionare movie mogul returned to a more hands-on role in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The same year, Nathan Gary was given the title of president of Annapurna Pictures, though the anonymous sources in IGN's report claim Gary's attention remained, for the most part, focused on Annapurna Interactive. In early 2024, Gary was either fired (according to IGN's anonymous sources) or resigned due to issues he had with other changes to Annapurna's staff and a recent demotion (according to an Annapurna spokesperson). Other staff members quit in protest, but Ellison later held a video call in which she allegedly expressed a desire to keep the whole team together, including those who had resigned--and apparently, it worked. Gary and other who had left returned.</p><p dir="ltr">Gary and Ellison later began discussing ideas regarding creating a spin-off studio that would still be connected to Annapurna Pictures. This studio was to be called Verset, and would effectively consist of Gary and the Annapurna Interactive staff members. Verset would be responsible for all currently in-progress Annapurna Interactive projects, and ownership of Verset would be split between leaders of both Verset and Annapurna Interactive.</p><p dir="ltr">According to IGN, some Annapurna Interactive employees were concerned by both the idea of Verset (which would effectively create a competitor for Annapurna Interactive) and some of Ellison's other moves, like the decision to rehire Hector Sanchez as Annapurna Pictures' "president of interactive and new media," fearing it could create even more competition within the Annapurna Interactive team.</p><p dir="ltr">Other concerns cited by IGN's sources include a deal Annapurna Pictures struck with Remedy for publishing rights on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-officially-in-development-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6509106/">Control 2</a>. Sanchez negotiated the deal himself, and Annapurna Interactive employees reportedly only heard about the Remedy deal the day it was announced to the public.</p><p dir="ltr">Fed up with the lack of transparency and Ellison's overall decision-making, Annapurna Interactive employees told IGN they gave Ellison two weeks of notice prior to the mass-walkout on September 6. Ellison reportedly showed no interest in negotiating with the Interactive team, and she evidently failed to warn Annapurna's other development partners of the impending walkout and the effect it could have on production.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Annapurna Pictures staff are reportedly filling in the gaps at Interactive to ensure the publisher's outstanding commitments are fulfilled and deadlines are met, but one game is still hanging precariously in the balance--Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, which is being developed internally as opposed to via a partnered studio.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Annapurna Interactive's take on the events, a spokesperson for the company called the situation "a baffler" and said that the company is now "focused on moving forward."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership," the spokesperson told IGN. "If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p>

The widely-expected Legacy of Kain: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 remaster has popped up in a now-deleted PlayStation Store listing, ahead of Sony's State of Play broadcast tonight.

That listing included a trailer for the game, which has now been reuploaded to social media, below. There's a release date, too: 10th December 2024.

			<p>What would you do if you were transported to another galaxy moments before Earth is unexpectedly destroyed? That is the scenario Doug and his pet guinea pig, Boom Boom, face in the Beyond Galaxyland. This part turn based RPG, part creature collector, is filled with various quests to undertake, from taking photos for people to trying to tear through space and time itself to save Earth. You know, your standard RPG stakes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Galaxyland | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Pre-Order on PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3_H7SZFDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Galaxyland is a pocket of space where sentient beings from all over the universe have been transported over hundreds of years when they walk through portals on their home planets. Some have, like Doug, arrived as their planet faces annihilation, while others stumbled across the portals when no threat was present. Most of the aliens live together on the core world of Neo, though Erros is primarily the home of humans, and a few other planets around have their own people too, and little hubs to visit.</p>


<p>Each of these planets provides Doug with places to rest, allies, shops to pick up consumables like health tonics, and artifacts to help improve attributes for battles. Beyond Galaxyland also features crafting allowing you to put together the tonics along with making artifacts, as long as you have the correct blueprint and ingredients. It is a simple process to craft, but you can only do so at save points. In fact, you can only save at save points too and there is no autosave. Helpfully, there are plenty of these dotted across the galaxy.</p>


<p>The core of Beyond Galaxyland is battling, and there is quite a bit to it. You can sneak up on an enemy and get in a preemptive strike, before your party of three characters – Doug and two companions of your choice – settle in for the fight.&nbsp;Each character has their own unique abilities. For example, Doug can scan enemies to learn more about them, such as their health and type, while Boom Boom can restore some HP for the whole party.</p>
<p>Abilities use ability points that are in a group pool, so you do have to think about which one will benefit in the moment. You can regain ability points using basic attacks, but some enemies have their own moves that can take away ability points. In addition to ability points, each character has their own summon points, which is where the creature capturing comes in.</p>
<p>Doug can capture enemies, including some of the bosses, and once captured they can be assigned to characters. Each character can equip up to four summons, and each of those summons can level up. Summons also have types, which have strengths and weaknesses against enemy types. For example, it is not a great idea to use an electric type against an electric enemy as you are more likely to heal it than hurt it.</p>

<p>As you battle, your main characters will level up too, opening more areas for them to adventure in without getting killed in one hit. You will move back and forth between the planets of Galaxyland a fair bit as more quests become available, and the quest log will show you the minimum level you should be to try and attempt a quest. The quests themselves follow a generally similar pattern in that your party needs to go somewhere to retrieve an item or speak to someone, with the questline finishing with a boss battle. The boss designs are very good too, as are the various enemies, and the different attacks can make fights interesting.</p>
<p>Outside of the battles and creature collecting, Beyond Galaxyland falls down a bit in various ways. First, there are numerous bugs. For example, on the planet of Arcos using the lift to get from the first floor to the top floor would see Doug fall through the surface. The only workaround I found was by going down to the lower floor and then using the lift to go to the top floor. There were also a few occasions where Doug and co would fall from a platform and end up in the background, making it impossible to interact with the foreground.</p>
<p>The platforming itself is not fun either, and the game would flow much better without it. It feels like, on the course to include so many different elements, there has been a bit of quality loss in some areas. The game includes racing and that could be better as it does not have any real feedback to it and the navigation can be cumbersome when moving.</p>

<p>The story of Beyond Galaxyland is serviceable, but feels familiar despite its setting. It is the classic fish out of water tale, facing off against insurmountable odds. The characters are decently written, though there isn’t a lot of depth to them. Boom Boom could become a fan favourite due to his backstory, while Pablo kind of appears and you learn very little about him through the story.</p>
<p>The visual design is a real strength, though, even if some effects are a bit heavy handed – I turned some off so that just walking around didn’t look so blurry. The world designs are each distinctive and the various peoples you meet and creatures you face all look great too. The soundtrack is very good too, and some of the tunes are a properly good vibe, especially some of the boss tracks.</p>
<p>Beyond Galaxyland is a game you could get through in a few days. Completing the story and the majority of side quests took me approximately 15 hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-added-to-greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-and-the-casting-of-frank-stone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA announced the latest batch of PC games that support DLSS 3 (Frame Generation) and DLSS 2 (Super Resolution). Fans of roleplaying games will find both in <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, out today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> for a price of $40. With this RPG sequel, Spiders made some bold choices, such as switching from action-based combat to tab-target-like real-time with pause. Narratively, GreedFall II: The Dying World flips the premise of the previous installment, putting players in the shoes of a Teer Fradee native who is forcibly removed from the island and brought to the old continent.</p>
<p>At the Early Access launch, GreedFall II includes the beginning of the main quest, three explorable regions (Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis), six companions, and six skill trees. Between Fall and Winter, fans can expect new companions and companion quests, an extension of the main quest, a new region, new skill trees, and the addition of the crafting system. There is no set release date for version 1.0 yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DLSS 3 is also available in The Casting of Frank Stone, the horror game developed by Supermassive Games in the Dead By Daylight universe. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received an 8/10 score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much of The Casting of Frank Stone, given how I only have a passing knowledge of Dead by Daylight, but after a few hours, I was hooked. This is a testament to the quality of the experience, which manages to be a great one for all sorts of players, granted they can stomach the little gameplay the adventure features, and the short run time for a single playthrough. The asking price of $39.99 is maybe a little too high for a six-hour-long game, but if you are into well-constructed horror stories, it could be a price worth paying.</em></p>
<p>DLSS 3 is available in Witchfire, too, which is out now on Steam with a new weapon, achievements, visual improvements, and rebalanced mechanics.</p>
<p>DLSS 2 is supported in Satisfactory, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exited</a> early access, Mortal Kombat 1, which received the Khaos Reigns expansion, and the new open world first-person shooter Echo Point Nova, out today.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vanillaware Strategy RPG Unicorn Overlord Hits One Million Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-one-million-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vanillaware-strategy-rpg-unicorn-overlord-hits-one-million-sales.989922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-one-million-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus and developer Vanillaware have announced that fantasy strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>has crossed a major sales barrier.</p>
<p>Released back in March, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-by-vanillaware-has-sold-500000-copies">hit 500,000 sales</a> just a few weeks after its initial launch, and now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1838385009322758274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>has officially sold a million copies across all platforms.</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the milestone, Atlus posted special artwork of the three characters Berengaria, Melisandre, and Rosalinde, created to mark the occasion by&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>artist Takashi Noma. You can take a look at that artwork below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sales-million.jpg?itok=DhVlGWoR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sales-million.jpg?itok=iedeixpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>artist Takashi Noma created this specifically to mark a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Atlus calls the milestone "huge" and thanks&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>players for helping it to reach a million sales, or, to put it in the studio's words, for "supporting the Liberation Army".</p>
<p><em>Unicorn Overlord</em>'s sales milestone is pretty impressive; after all, the game belongs to a fairly niche genre, although it's fair to say Vanillaware (whose previous works include games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/13-sentinels-aegis-rim"><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em></a>) has a fanbase all its own as well.</p>
<p>The fact that the game is published by Atlus, whose works include immensely popular RPGs like the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, certainly doesn't hurt either. That title's a pretty catchy one, too.</p>
<p>Still, it took the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-sales-top-million-worldwide">several years to hit the million mark</a>, although it's only on two platforms as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord</em>'s multiplatform release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, it's a fantasy real-time strategy RPG created by Vanillaware, the studio responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Odin Sphere</em>,&nbsp;<em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, and&nbsp;<em>GrimGrimoire</em>.</p>
<p>The game casts you as exiled prince Alain, who must <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-by-vanillaware-shows-off-how-you-can-make-your-army-stronger">gather an army</a> to rise up and take back his kingdom from an oppressive empire. As you go, you'll recruit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vanillawares-unicorn-overlord-reveals-characters-classes-and-more-with-gorgeous">new fighters</a> for your army, engage in optional extra battles, and explore the fantasy world of Fevrith.</p>
<p><em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>is available right now for PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch (although not for PC, for some reason). Stay tuned for more.</p>

That also means we’ll need more time to finish it, though. <em>DECAPOLICE</em> is now scheduled for release in 2026.”</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Opening Theme Song Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="DECAPOLICE - Theme Song Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26_5AP81zN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><!-- AD: content -->

that remove the PSN requirement. But it's unclear why Sony put that in Ragnarok in the first place since the game is only a single-player title. It makes more sense to utilize PSN for multiplayer games that actually need to be online. There's no apparent reason why Ragnarok has to be subject to the same restrictions.</p><p>Sony previously showed some willingness to compromise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">it dropped the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2 </a>after a backlash. However, the upcoming remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-is-out-october-4-puts-it-on-collision-course-with-silent-hill-2/1100-6525780/" data-ref-id="1100-6525780">Until Dawn</a> will also be subject to a mandatory PSN connection. This issue is likely to be an ongoing irritation for gamers if Sony keeps insisting on adding the PSN requirement to future PC games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/behaviour-red-hook-purchase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>publisher Behaviour Interactive has announced that it has acquired&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Red Hook Studios for an undisclosed amount of money.</p>
<p>In a press release, Behaviour says its acquisition of Red Hook "highlights [Behaviour's] commitment to horror", and that the purchase of the studio "reinforces Behaviour's leading position in horror gaming".</p>
<p>None of Red Hook's team members will be let go, it seems, and the studio will contoinue to function "as an independent studio within Behaviour", so it sounds like no management or strategy changes will be taking place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-darkest-dungeon.jpg?itok=8R2sEtMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-darkest-dungeon.jpg?itok=knDyN1Qg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Red Hook is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Behaviour CEO&nbsp;Rémi Racine says the acquisition of Red Hook is "another emphatic step" towards his studio's objective of becoming "synonymous with horror". He also teases "more to come" on this front.</p>
<p>Red Hook co-founder Chris Bourassa, meanwhile, says that his studio and Behaviour are "kindred spirits"; they're both Canadian, they're both independent, and, according to Bourassa, they're both "devoted to fantastic horror games".</p>
<p>Fellow Red Hook co-founder Tyler Sigman says Red Hook will benefit from Behaviour's "considerable knowledge and resources", and that the two studios are "stronger together than apart", pledging to "delve even deeper" into the&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>franchise alongside Behaviour.</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is known for its many IP collaborations, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date"><em>Castlevania</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover"><em>Tomb Raider</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover">many</a> more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover">besides</a>, could this acquisition result in a&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>crossover someday? We can but hope.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-dead-by-daylight.jpg?itok=Dg6k2wzC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-dead-by-daylight.jpg?itok=DpKggLZf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Behaviour's best-known game is the multiplayer horror title&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The announcement of Behaviour's acquisition of Red Hook arguably comes at a somewhat inopportune time.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio announced it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled">canceled&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>third-person shooter spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled">Project T</a>&nbsp;</em>and shut down development studio Midwinter, so announcing that another studio has been acquired in the wake of that news seems a touch insensitive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we'll have to wait and see what Behaviour does now that Red Hook is part of its studio stable. With <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split">big things coming for&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>in the future</a>, Behaviour's support could mean even more updates or DLC for the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>
