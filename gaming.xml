It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">$1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">$2,099.99 Slate</a></strong> — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s <a href="https://content.ibuypower.com/Download/GPU-Manual.pdf">instructions</a>. Normally $2,149, you can currently get it for $1,899 at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">iBuyPower</a> when you use coupon code <strong>STARS </strong>at checkout.</p><p>The Slate has slightly different specs, some that are improved over the Element above and some that are a bit below what it provides. The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Like the R07, it includes a wired keyboard and mouse to get you started, along with a 750W power supply, a liquid cooling system, and a one-year warranty. It’s available for $2,099.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/878927/ibuypower-gaming-desktop-pc-presidents-day-sale-deal]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">managed to catch it <a href="https://t.co/Yyu0FaoDJ7">pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7</a></p> <p>— Folf (@itsfolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsfolf/status/2021749585111069152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>rallying $150 million towards it in 2021</span></a><span>. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>

<p>"We can confirm that we're taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be. This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio's co-founders," the studio stated.</p>
<p>"We recognise these changes are difficult, and we're approaching them thoughtfully. Out of respect for everyone involved, we won't comment on individual situations.</p>
<p>"We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we'll do it through our official channels."</p>
<p>It's unclear which, if any, of the team's original nine-member team remain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-gameplay-trailer-pc-gaming-show">We last had an update on Den of Wolves back in December</a>. A teaser showcased a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad.</p>

That's three whole decades of exploring many and various regions to find monsters, battle monsters, and pocket monsters - and we've all got our personal favourites.</p>
<p>And they're not <em>always</em> just our starter, either! Sure, you build up a special relationship with your first Pokémon each generation, but there are usually a half-dozen winners who work their way into your good books as well as your team - and maybe even your <em>heart</em>, assuming you're not a cold Rock-type (and they can be awesome, too!).</p>
<p>In honour of this momentous anniversary, we'll be running a series of polls leading up to the big day where we get your votes for your favourite Pokémon from each generation. Then, we'll pit the winners against each other in a final nine-generation showdown to find out Nintendo Life readers' very favourite Pokémon from the <del>7 million</del> 1,025 discovered thus far.</p>
<p>We'll be covering a generation every day for the next nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown between the top 'mons at the end of the month. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days after going live.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/feature_best_pokemon_starters_from_all_gens_as_voted_by_you">We've looked at starters before</a>, and they're bound to poll well.

<p>While the choice is yours and we certainly don't wish to influence your decision, we feel a duty to remind you of some less obvious picks from each gen. So let's quickly ask Team NL for some underdog candidates they'll consider before casting their vote. Team?</p>

<p>Okay, that's more than enough ado - here's the poll featuring all 151 Gen 1 Pokémon in National Dex order. Remember, you can only choose one, so pick wisely!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ashes-creation-investor-alleges-140-million-fraud/</link>
            <guid>1436206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p id="h-">Earlier this month, the developer behind the crowdfunded fantasy MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, <strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmorpg-ashes-of-creation-suddenly-implodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly <strong>collapsed</strong></a>, leaving backers and fans baffled <strong>less than two months after the game's launch on Steam Early Access</strong>.</p>



<p id="h-">As it turns out, though, the project <strong>had been teetering on the brink of collapse for a very long time</strong>. YouTuber <strong>NefasQS</strong>, AKA Casper, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQOTjfCIS3g&amp;pp=ygUHbmVmYXNxcw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has managed to interview one of the game's main investors</a>, <strong>Jason Caramanis</strong>, who has come forward to reveal what he alleges is a massive, years-long fraud perpetrated by <strong>Steven Sharif</strong>, founder and creative director of Intrepid Studios. Caramanis is a 57-year-old <strong>multi-level marketing (MLM) entrepreneur</strong> who made his fortune primarily through <strong>Jeunesse Global</strong>, a Florida-based anti-aging skincare and supplements MLM company, where he achieved the rank of Imperial Diamond Director. He has also joined other MLM companies over the years, and in the video, acknowledges being "at the top of the pyramids". Caramanis <strong>claims to have lost $12.5 million of his own money</strong> by investing in Ashes of Creation and believing in Sharif's empty promises.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-web-of-deception">A Web of Deception</h2>



<p>At the heart of his allegations is a key devastating claim: Steven Sharif <strong>never invested a penny of his own money into Intrepid Studios</strong>, despite publicly claiming to have contributed between <strong>$30 million</strong> and <strong>$60 million</strong> over the years. According to QuickBooks records recently obtained by Caramanis, not only did Sharif fail to invest personal capital despite claims to the contrary, but he and his partner, <strong>John Moore</strong>, who was listed as the company's Chief Financial Officer, <strong>systematically withdrew $500,000 per year in salary payments</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-money-trail">The Money Trail</h2>



<p>While public reports suggested the company had raised between <strong>$109 million</strong> and <strong>$115 million</strong>, Caramanis claims the actual figure approaches <strong>$140 million</strong> when accounting for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Ashes%20of%20Creation&amp;total_hits=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter funds</a>, Commerce Bank loans, PPP loans, and various private investments. including $2 million from <strong>Tom Alkazin</strong>, a 70-something family friend. Those were Alkazin's and his wife's life savings, which Caramanis says he regrets. It should be noted that Alkazin is also an MLM entrepreneur <strong>who made his fortune via pyramid schemes</strong>; unlike Caramanis, who was never found liable in lawsuits, Alkazin <strong><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/161222_vemma_274-_stipulated_final_order_alkazin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settled with the Federal Trade Commission to pay $1.2 million</a></strong> (with a larger judgment of over <strong>$6.7 million</strong> partially suspended), alongside a forfeiture of 1.61 acres in San Marcos, California. Alkazin <strong>was also permanently banned from engaging in pyramid schemes</strong> and any future MLM activities.</p>



<p>But the single largest victim of Intrepid Studios and the whole Ashes of Creation project is apparently <strong>Robert Dawson</strong>, a wealthy investor whom Caramanis introduced to Sharif several years ago in Las Vegas. According to Caramanis, between 2022 and 2025, <strong>Dawson injected approximately $80 million of his own capital into the failing company</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-transparency-no-governance">No Transparency, No Governance</h2>



<p>Despite contractual obligations and investor demands, Sharif allegedly refused to provide books and records, tax returns, or QuickBooks files for 9 years. Caramanis claims he was promised a board seat in 2019 but <strong>never attended a single board meeting</strong> for a straightforward reason: because <strong>none were ever called</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Do you know how many board meetings I've been to? Zero. Do you know how many board meetings he's ever called? Zero. The only thing that guy's good at is bullshitting people. And he might be a good creative director. He might be a good gamer, but everything else is full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;].</em></p>



<p>Even a lawsuit filed by Caramanis demanding access to company records yielded nothing. He allegedly obtained the QuickBooks files <strong>only three days before the livestream</strong>, provided by Dawson's accountant, <strong>Ryan Ogden</strong>, after months of forensic review.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-mansion-and-the-lies">The Mansion and the Lies</h2>



<p>The California mansion from which Sharif regularly livestreamed updates on Ashes of Creation's development <strong>became a symbol of the alleged deception</strong>. Caramanis claims Sharif and John were originally renting the property, not owning it as many assumed. When they eventually purchased it, the down payment allegedly came from company funds, or rather, the very salaries they were paying themselves while claiming to be "losing everything" on the game.</p>



<p>The house drama reached a crisis point in 2024 when the original owner's mortgage came due and Sharif couldn't refinance due to Commerce Bank holding a second position as collateral for company loans. Facing foreclosure, Sharif <strong>turned to his investors once more</strong>, and Caramanis and Dawson came to his rescue again by contributing another $2 million to save the house.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-company-burning-money">A Company Burning Money</h2>



<p>By 2025, Intrepid Studios was <strong>hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate</strong>. The company's monthly operating expenses exceeded $2.5 million, while revenue from in-game purchases ranged from $150,000 to $200,000, resulting in a monthly loss of around $2.3 million. At this burn rate, <strong>even Dawson's massive capital infusions couldn't sustain the operation indefinitely</strong>.</p>



<p>The situation became dire in late 2024. Multiple payrolls were missed around the Alpha 2 release, which, as those who followed the game already know, got delayed by several weeks. Moreover, Alpha 2 bonuses, which had been promised to employees three months in advance, <strong>were delayed indefinitely</strong>.</p>



<p>The financial crisis affected more than just employees, though. In December 2025, cloud services provider <strong>SADA Systems</strong> <a href="https://allaboutlawyer.com/ashes-of-creation-lawsuit-game-studio-shuts-down-after-850k-breach-of-contract-claim-mass-layoffs-hit-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit with the <strong>New York Supreme Court</strong></a>, seeking <strong>$852,630</strong> for nearly three years of unpaid Google Cloud Platform services dating back to September 2022. The services were cancelled in April 2025 due to non-payment.</p>



<p>When confronted about the lawsuit on Reddit in December 2025, Sharif <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1pjobvr/comment/nth5pe9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed it as 'peanuts'</a>, claiming that '<strong>$800k is a week's worth of opex for the studio</strong>' and suggesting that such disputes were fairly common and would be resolved in a similar manner to other disputes Intrepid had seen before. Yet, mere weeks later, the company was unable to process payroll and had to shut down entirely. The SADA case revealed that Intrepid <strong>had been technically insolvent for years</strong>, unable to pay even basic infrastructure bills for cloud services, yet still kept raising millions from new investors, including most of Dawson's $80 million between 2022 and 2025, according to Caramanis's testimony.</p>



<p>Under the light of this new information, <strong>the timing of the December 2025 Steam Early Access launch now appears even more strategic</strong>. The release technically satisfied the Kickstarter promises, as we had postulated in our previous report, blocked refund claims, and generated an estimated $3 to 5 million in revenue based on 220K-320K copies sold. It also <strong>provided the final pool of money that Sharif would seize</strong> through Commerce Bank just two months later.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-final-betrayal">The Final Betrayal</h2>



<p>By January 2026, Robert Dawson had reached his breaking point. Having invested $80 million <strong>with no return and facing continued operational losses</strong>, he initiated what Caramanis describes as a reasonable restructuring plan. The proposal <strong>called for 60-70% staff layoffs to make the company financially sustainable</strong>, a new funding round requiring all existing investors to contribute 25% of their previous investment to maintain equity, and a new role for Sharif as Creative Director with earnout-based equity tied to company performance rather than immediate ownership.</p>



<p><strong>Sharif, however, flat-out refused</strong>. Caramanis revealed that he demanded immediate equity despite having contributed no capital. When negotiations failed, Sharif allegedly <strong>took action that would destroy the company entirely</strong>.</p>



<p>Between approximately January 26 and 31, Sharif resigned as Creative Director and <strong>executed what Caramanis calls an act of sabotage</strong>. He had Commerce Bank send a letter to <strong>Valve</strong> claiming the Steam revenue from the December early access launch, approximately <strong>$3.7 million</strong>, that had been earmarked for the February 1st payroll. This money <strong>was instead used to pay off Commerce Bank's loan secured by Sharif's house</strong>, releasing $1.5 to $1.6 million in escrow to him personally. The seizure of funds left the company <strong>unable to make payroll and effectively bankrupted it</strong>. Caramanis portrays Steven's seizure of the Steam revenue as a <strong>deliberate act of sabotage</strong>, thus destroying the company rather than accepting the performance-based compensation proposed by main investor Robert Dawson.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-human-cost">The Human Cost</h2>



<p>Beyond the staggering financial losses, the human toll is immeasurable. As mentioned earlier, Tom and Bethany Alkazin, now in their seventies, <strong>lost their $2 million life savings</strong> and face financial problems they'll likely "never come back from," according to Caramanis. He himself <strong>admits to crying at night</strong> and breaking down during a dinner with Dawson in Beverly Hills, when the weight of the losses and betrayal finally overwhelmed him.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Caramanis can bounce back from this, but others won't be able to. The company's employees, many of whom believed in the project and worked tirelessly to bring it to fruition, <strong>found themselves unpaid and betrayed</strong>. The gaming community, which had invested not just money but years of hope and anticipation, <strong>could just watch as their dream of a promising new MMORPG collapsed</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h2>



<p><strong>Robert Dawson now controls the Ashes of Creation intellectual property</strong> through foreclosure proceedings and his position as a secured creditor. Caramanis holds first-position UCC filings that predate Commerce Bank's involvement. Multiple lawsuits are reportedly imminent, including from TFE Games (which invested $5 million), Commerce Bank (which Caramanis claims was defrauded with false revenue reports), and numerous other investors. <strong>Caramanis alleges that Sharif committed federal crimes by booking investor loans as revenue on tax returns</strong>. It's a claim he says he can prove with documentation, including <strong>380 pages of text messages</strong>, emails demanding financial records, UCC filings, contracts, QuickBooks files showing cash flows, and correspondence with Commerce Bank. He has offered to share these materials with content creators and the community to substantiate his claims:</p>



<p><em>There's nothing I'm saying that is slanderous or libelous about Stephen. He's a pathological nutcase liar. And guess what? You're going to see numerous lawsuits come out against him for fraud, for whatever else.</em> <em>All this is going to come out in litigation.</em></p>



<p>Caramanis believes that <strong>the rest of Intrepid's employees were also victims of Sharif's alleged deceptions</strong>. His anger is directed solely at Sharif, his partner John, and Sharif's mother, all of whom he accuses of being complicit in the fraud.</p>



<p>As for the actual game, <strong>Dawson is reportedly exploring options to continue developing Ashes of Creation</strong>, but key technical staff allegedly refuse to communicate with him, having been "poisoned" against investors by Sharif, claimed Caramanis. Meanwhile, Sharif reportedly continues to moderate the official Discord server, timing out critics and maintaining his connection to the community. Throughout the interview, Caramanis painted a picture of systematic psychological manipulation:</p>



<p><em>Go look up NPD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It describes him to a T. He's the most narcissistic tool I've ever met in my entire life.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-a-dream">The End of a Dream</h2>



<p>For the thousands of Ashes of Creation supporters who dreamed of playing a polished, final version of the ambitious MMORPG, which sought to bring about "<strong>the rebirth of the genre</strong>", and for the investors who lost millions believing in that dream, <strong>the allegations paint a cautionary tale about trust, transparency, and the devastating consequences when both are absent</strong>. The truth of these allegations will ultimately be determined in courtrooms, but regardless of the legal outcomes, <strong>the collapse of Intrepid Studios may enter the history books as one of the most spectacular failures in the gaming industry</strong>.</p>



<p>Steven Sharif hasn't publicly responded yet to the allegations shared by Caramanis. On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Steven_AoC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he hasn't been active since Friday, January 23</a>; on Discord, he posted the now-infamous statement on January 31, revealing to the community that he resigned because he '<strong>could not ethically agree with or carry out</strong>' the board's directions. Of course, should he provide his side of the story, we'll update this report accordingly.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <guid>1436182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My ongoing quest to turn my iPhone into one of my favorite consoles of all time has led me to a curiously named controller. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir’s Pocket Taco</a> is only barely pocketable, and distinctly lacking in taco fillings, <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">but for $35</a>, it’s an excellent and easy way to turn your phone into a Game Boy-inspired handheld for playing retro games that don’t require a pair of thumbsticks.</p><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth">Abxylute M4 mobile controller</a> that attaches to phones using magnets, or the Backbone Pro that sandwiches your device between a split gamepad, the Pocket Taco uses a hinged mechanism that, for lack of a better description, bites onto the bottom half of your smartphone.</p><div id=":R1hir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>Inside the Pocket Taco are soft silicone pads on either side that grip your phone without damaging it.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ergonomics aren’t as good as standalone controllers, but the Pocket Taco is quite comfortable to play with.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Inside the Pocket Taco, you’ll find soft silicone pads on either side that securely grip your device without scratching it or leaving any bite marks. The hold feels satisfyingly secure, and while my iPhone could slightly shift from side to side while inside the Pocket Taco, at no point did it ever feel at risk of falling out on its own.</p><p>The Pocket Taco’s hinge expands wide enough to attach to smartphones still inside bulky cases, and its open sides can accommodate phones and devices wider than the controller itself. You could use it with an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review">iPad Mini,</a> for example, although I didn’t have the chance to test the ergonomics of such a setup.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo announced a similar Game Boy-style controller</a> for smartphones at CES 2026, featuring a front panel that can fully flip down. I couldn’t understand why anyone would want that feature, but after playing with the Pocket Taco for a week, I now understand why 8BitDo took that approach.</p><p>The front panel on the Pocket Taco can only hinge outward about 45 degrees, blocking the lower part of your smartphone’s screen while attached to your device. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854303/8bitdo-mobile-smartphone-controller-ios-android-flippad-game-boy">8BitDo’s FlipPad</a> gives you full access to your smartphone’s screen and UI while it’s attached, but I frequently found myself having to completely remove the Pocket Taco if I wanted to flip over to another app, or even just unlock my phone.</p><div id=":R1k2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A passthrough hole on the bottom of the Pocket Taco lets you plug in a power cable, assuming your device’s charging port is centered.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A hard plastic carrying case is included, but the Pocket Taco is a bit too thick to be comfortably pocketed.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I haven’t tested the USB-C 8BitDo FlipPad yet, but a big advantage of the larger Pocket Taco is that it connects to your device over Bluetooth and has its own 600mAh rechargeable battery that won’t drain your phone. Opening the Pocket Taco powers it on and automatically pairs the controller with the last device you used — in my case, an iPhone 16 Pro. GameSir doesn’t list iOS as being officially supported, only Android, but I was able to connect to the Pocket Taco and my iPhone recognized it as a “DualShock 4 Wireless Controller.”</p><p>The Pocket Taco turns off automatically when you remove it from your phone. It powers up and reconnects quickly, though, so having to occasionally remove the controller to access your phone’s screen isn’t a huge inconvenience.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco turns on automatically when attached to a phone, but it can also be powered on manually and used as a portable standalone wireless gamepad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Pocket Taco’s home button can also be used to manually power it on and off when it isn’t attached to a device, allowing it to be used as a standalone rechargeable Bluetooth controller. It was easy to pair with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>.</p><div id=":R1mir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco’s controls look and feel very similar to the original Game Boy’s, but with a few more buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Two sets of shoulder buttons can be found on the back of the Pocket Taco, with a USB-C charging port in between them.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four face buttons and D-pad all feel good with a solid click when pressed, and despite it being a little narrower than the original Game Boy, my large hands found the Pocket Taco extremely comfortable to play with. The double pair of shoulder buttons on the back were easy to reach, and the rounded edges on the bottom of the Pocket Taco didn’t dig into the fingers I was using to support the controller and my phone.</p><p>There are just a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when choosing what games to play, or how to play them. Unlike the Abxylute M4 or the Backbone controllers, GameSir made no attempt to squeeze thumbsticks or sliding joysticks onto the Pocket Taco. So it’s better suited for playing retro games from the 16-bit era and earlier that don’t have 3D environments with a camera to control.</p><div id=":R1o2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The GameSir mobile app shrinks to half screen with the Pocket Taco attached, and lets you update firmware and remap the controller’s buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>You may need to make some adjustments if an app or emulator centers a game vertically onscreen, as it will be partially blocked with the Pocket Taco attached.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I primarily tested the Pocket Taco with Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and GBA games played through the Delta emulator and RetroArch on iOS. The Pocket Taco worked great with both, but you’ll want to make sure you’re using an app with skins or layout options that can position the game closer to the top of your device’s screen. When I first tested the Pocket Taco with Delta, I turned off the emulator’s default skin to remove on-screen controls. That resulted in the game being vertically centered on my iPhone and partially covered by the Pocket Taco. It was easy to fix, but note that the controller can only be used in a vertical orientation.</p><p>8BitDo hasn’t announced pricing or a release date for its FlipPad yet, so I’m still curious how effective that smaller accessory will be at turning my smartphone into a handheld console, given its limitations. The <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">Pocket Taco isn’t expected to ship until March 2026</a>, but for $35, you get excellent controls, solid ergonomics, reliable Bluetooth connectivity, nearly universal smartphone compatibility, and the ability to use it as a standalone wireless gamepad.</p><p><em>Photography by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/877491/gamesir-pocket-taco-wireless-bluetooth-controller-clamp-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The glory days of gross-out video game PR stunts are long behind us, sadly. If and when we do get a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258"><i><span>Resident Evil 6</span></i><span> remake</span></a><span>, it’s unlikely Capcom will serve it with a side of </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-resident-evil-human-meat-butchery/"><span>human-flavored sausages</span></a><span>. PlayStation doesn’t even hold ocean-hopping destination press events anymore, never mind ones where they can </span><a href="https://www.informationweek.com/software-services/sony-apologizes-for-decapitated-goat-in-god-of-war-launch"><span>sacrifice a live animal</span></a><span> for tech bloggers. Though our greatest retches are in the rearview, the PR machine can still churn out some nasties here and there. The biggest surprise is when they prove to be all practical.</span></p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/"><span>Over at </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span>, journalist Nathan Grayson has been bothered by a blood-fueled gaming PC, which apparently uses real-deal human plasma for liquid coolant, ever since Blizzard gave it away to <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">promote </a></span><i><span>Diablo IV</span></i><span> in 2023. Grayson tried to shake down PR reps and hardware experts hoping to uncover how much blood was in there, whose blood it was, and whether such an unholy contraption is at all practical. No dice.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, Grayson did succeed in tracking down the original winner of this infernal machine, a streamer by the name of </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888"><span>Storms888</span></a><span>. While it didn’t solve the gross mysteries that got under his skin, Grayson did learn something just as shocking: the damn thing still works. Two years later the rig continues pumping its blood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I haven’t seen any drops in performance since the day I got it,” Storms888 tells Grayson. “Did leak a ton though.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The streamer says that he believes the liquid coolant to be a cocktail of human blood and more conventional ingredients. But there is some amount of blood. Blizzard sent him replacement vials and documentational slips confirming the red stuff came from human donors. Storms888 said it’s an incredible rig for his purposes, which include livestreaming “</span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> at ultra settings.” And with RAM prices through the roof, who can blame him for not upgrading.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is hardly the first time the deep red stuff has been used in a promotional stunt, nor the first time it was batched to accomplish it. In 1977, Marvel Comics mixed their ink with blood donated from each member of KISS for their funny book debut. Lil Nas X did something similar, drawing blood for </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kiss-used-band-members-blood-in-marvel-comic-book-2021-3"><span>a custom pair of Nikes</span></a><span> to promote 2021’s </span><i><span>Montero</span></i><span>. Blood, it turns out, is in you to give. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If Blizzard, Activision or Microsoft were to pull this stunt again, or cram any other body parts into giveaway hardware, it wouldn’t even make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>the list of the most</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-files-bobby-kotick-activision-ghislaine-maxwell-2000665456"><span>nauseating things</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>to come out of them</span></a><span> in recent history.</span></p>

 <p><span>Storms888 remains chuffed by his useful, practical, even, gross-out gift. You can read Nathan Grayson’s </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/"><span>full interview with the ichor-powered gamer on </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

            <p>Valve is testing the ability to permit Steam reviewers to include hardware specs in their reviews.</p>
<p>Though only available to participants in Steam's Client Beta for now, reviewers will be able to "attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page".</p>
<p>If it rolls out to all, it'll help players identify if any performance issues are restricted to certain specs or configurations, and if anyone else with a similar rig is having the same problems.</p>
<p>The patch also fixes an issue wherein streaming could throttle downloads even after you've finished streaming, and adds the option to provide anonymised framerate data.</p>
<p>"When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve explains in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">beta client patch notes</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-reviews-set-to-show-a-players-specs-so-its-easier-to-know-if-youll-share-their-experience-or-they-misread-the-minimum/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS."</p>
<p>Here's the full patch note:</p>
<blockquote><p>General</p>

<p>Talking of Steam, a couple of weeks ago, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Colonialism is not merely about occupying nations. It’s a project of mass violence, part of which involves total erasure and the widespread theft of some of the most culturally significant artifacts in the world. Even today, colonizing nations proudly display stolen artifacts, acting as peacocking robbers under the guise of tourism. See, for example, the British Museum’s continual hold of the Egyptian Rosetta Stone, the so-called Benin Bronzes, and the Ethiopian Maqdala collection. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/12/restitution-row-how-nigerias-new-home-for-the-benin-bronzes-ended-up-with-clay-replicas">Colonized nations have sought to reclaim their stolen culture</a>.</p><p>But what happens when kind requests and diplomatic maneuvers are not only insufficient but undeserving of the ongoing crime? This is where the fantasy of the moral heist comes in — and no game has done it better than <em>Relooted</em>.</p><p>Developed by South African studio Nyamakop, <em>Relooted</em> focuses on a group of lovable, albeit unprofessional, Johannesburg-based thieves from different African countries. They have a singular goal: Reclaim from colonizer nations what was stolen from Africa. Playing as the frontwoman Nomali, a world-class parkour athlete, you help start this ragtag group inspired by her grandmother, a history professor. The game is an Africanfuturist (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nyamakop_some-screenshots-from-relooted-and-why-we-activity-7343997849002565632-0RKq">as opposed to Afrofuturist</a>) 2.5D heist-’em-up platformer, sending Nomali and her team around the Global North, infiltrating museums, private collections, and banks to take back legendary but stolen artifacts.</p><p>Once acquired, the team anonymously seeks to deposit them in the the Museum of Black Civilisations in Senegal. What I found surprising was that the museum, like every artifact, is in fact entirely real.</p><p>In mission briefings in your Batcave-like base, you get a genuine short history lesson on the artifact and, through it, Africa’s colonized past. For example, did you know the modern Republic of Benin, a West African nation, and the historical and powerful Kingdom of Benin (which reached its peak in the 15th century), located in what is now Nigeria, are different? Legendary masks of this kingdom were looted by colonizers and not returned, held by, among others, the British Museum.</p><p>In the fictional world of <em>Relooted</em>, this is precisely where Nomali and her crew come in. If the nations that profited off theft and stolen labor won’t return the artifacts, then Nomali and co. will simply take them back. They’re benevolent thieves; the team doesn’t make a profit and only will only steal what was previously stolen. As a lawyer, I have qualms, since in most legal systems theft of even your own property is still theft — you cannot break into your robber’s home to reclaim your phone, for example. But as someone whose ancestors were colonized by the British in India before moving to a British-occupied South Africa, this was deeply fulfilling and morally wholesome.</p><p>Every mission sees you scouting the level for robot guards, exits, and additional artifacts. You discuss this with your team, each of whom provides a different skill that is itself a mechanic in the game: Your brother is a locksmith who can break into doors or safes, while another team member is a professional acrobat who can use Batman-like skills to reach impossible areas. After scouting, Nomali is then tasked with retrieval of the artifact(s).</p><p>However, you must also make sure of your exit. This is the most exciting part for me, as it requires you to plan your escape route before setting off the alarm. After Nomali snags the object, you must then follow a perfect route out without getting caught by chasing drones. You can also plan to steal a few artifacts, meaning you need to be clever about which item to steal first; it could be that the item closest to the entrance is in fact <em>not</em> the best first option, as it is awkwardly placed. Careful planning and running through the route, placing your teammates in the right areas, all leads to a clockwork-like heist that would make Arsène Lupin proud.</p><p>The game is a cerebral platformer, a satisfying mixture of brains and twitch responses. You feel the exhilaration of a fast chase, as well as the satisfaction of a well-considered exit plan with the coordinated efforts of your teammates, when executed properly and all artifacts are in tow.</p><p>The stages are varied, sometimes not using the names as we know them now. For instance, the US is known as “the Shiny Place,” depicted as a mixture of Las Vegas and New York, with more cyberpunk aesthetics. Another is a European mansion, home of a “collector,” depicted in dark, rain-drenched cobblestone streets and with creepy paintings haunting cold brick walls. Stages usually last between five to 10 minutes, unless you repeat them due to a faulty plan or execution.</p><p>Repetition does set in, despite a wider story eventually unfolding. There’s only so much variety when dealing with 2D stages and limited mechanics, but the game does not wear out its welcome. The graphics are quite dated; though it is attempting to look like a Pixar film or other modern animation productions, character faces are flat and dialogue animations look stiff and basic.</p><p>However, parkour animations are fluid, and the colors and world are vibrant. Nomali felt great to control, especially when you get into a “flow” of parkour movement. This is heightened by an incredible soundtrack from composers Nick Horsten and Dustin van Wyk, which is able to both soothe as ambience and pump up for the action set pieces. Using a mixture of electronic and traditional instruments, the soundscapes capture the Africanfuturistic theme as well as the ’80s James Bond espionage aesthetics for our sneaky thieves.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> is very special to me as a South African. Not only is it made by South Africans, but it centres on a <em>pan</em>-African group, working together for a common goal of reclaiming what was stolen by colonial occupiers. Ugandan scholar <a href="https://roape.net/2022/12/02/surrounded-an-ethnography-of-new-colonialism/#:~:text=A%20recent%20study%20put%20the,the%20old%20form%20of%20colonialism.">Yusuf Serunkuma cites one calculation</a> that puts the loss Africa experienced through colonization between 1960–2010 at an estimated $152 trillion. To think of where my country and continent would be today were it not for the enormous theft and exploitation makes me continually angry. Even today, African citizens still have to visit former colonizer nations to view their own history.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> serves as a fine and righteous outlet for the moral rage at the unfairness and unjust occupation and horror experienced by this continent, and fulfills double roles as a history lesson and fun heist platformer. Here’s hoping more people discover just how bloody and unfair African history really was — and how wonderful, beautiful, and inspiring our continent and its people remain.</p><p><sub>Relooted <em>is available now on the Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/878121/relooted-review-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Finally, the world’s first yassified boomer shooter. Originally, we started calling DOOM-style shooters ‘boomer shooters’ because it called back to the aged, hyper-masculine games of that era that seemed to be inspiring a modern resurgence of games in that style. In recent years, though, the subgenre has taken on a life of it’s own, fully removed from those retro inspirations – and in many cases, the people who play these games and the fanbases that form for them are a far cry from the traditional bro-gamer image that someone might tie to DOOM or Quake or Duke Nukem.</p>
<p>Games like Ultrakill and Neon White prove that nontraditional audiences are dying for nontraditional games that capture the style and essence they call home. It felt like the eventual endpoint for boomer shooters: to create a game fully built on femininity and glam in the modern Charlie XCX brat summer tone, rather than the all-too-familiar Barbie pastiche that “games for girls” immediately evoke. <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!&nbsp;</em>is unabashedly a game for the gals, made by the gals. While the spirit and style is there in awesome excess, though, I think the gals deserve a game with more polish and quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Don't Stop, Girlypop! | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yi8C56wBsF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em>, in the best way possible, feels like a scrappy indie hyperpop zine lovingly made in Unreal Engine. From the moment you turn the game on, the bright, bubbly buttons on the menu evoke early-2000s maximalist web design. You press New Game, and suddenly you’re a fairy warrior named Imber being aided by an FMV companion who talks to you through a pink glam’d out flip phone – your mission is to defend your neon pink planet from the Tigris Nix corporation draining it of all The Love. It’s weird, and silly, and barely explained and hardly complicated – but also, like, yes girl, your gun is pink, and your phone is pink, and your enemies need to explode.</p>
<p>The game is maximalist and overindulgent and unashamed with its tone and style, and I can’t fault it for any of that. One of the things I love the most about indie games is their potential to be a canvas for expression and unorthodox art, and no part of the art here feels like a cruel parody – it’s all steeped in a sincerity and barely-holding-back-a-laugh sense of humour that is so charming.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the game is way too rough around the edges to make up for that scrappy charm and style. From the start of the game, there’s an awkward sort of floatiness to…everything. The camera hangs awkwardly in cutscenes, and there’s a sort of unfinished vibe to the inconsistent way various early in-game tutorials pop up. Characters are voiced, but some of them sound like they’re hardly putting in any effort, while others are almost mute-the-game levels of annoying in how repetitive their efforts are.</p>
<p>Early on, you encounter a boss, your flip-phone companion summons some giant speakers, and loud hyperpop blasts all around you as you fight this foe. It’s an amazing moment on paper, but the pacing of the dialogue delivery, the lack of animated or sound-designed emphasis for the speakers appearing, and the awkward way the song restarts after the cutscene ends and the actual gameplay begins make it hard to fully appreciate the idea when the execution is so lacking.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em> has an interesting premise for combat – you’re supposed to never stop moving in this game, and you’ve got a huge speed multiplier visible on-screen at all times that goes up if you jump, dash, kill, grapple, or wave hop. Wave hopping, as explained by the game, is a unique forward boost of momentum you can trigger by jumping, ground-slamming, jumping back up, and dashing forward. I love the kind of frenetic, sweat-inducing energy that a shooter creates when you’re tasked with nonstop movement – it’s a big reason why I love <em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>so much. In this game, though, while the idea is solid, your core movement fundamentals feel just a bit sloppy.</p>

<p>You move with snail-like slowness when your multiplier is at zero, making the start of each run or any moment you stop to listen to a story-focused audio echo feel a bit awkward. The wave hop, while satisfying upon successful execution, is just a bit too involved to be executed constantly like the game expects you to. And some mechanics like wall-running and grappling just straight-up do not work properly sometimes, leading to lots of moments where I’m just sort of mashing buttons to force out some helpful movement without a clear or consistent understanding of how I’ll move or how fast I am.</p>
<p>Guns are pretty great in this game, though. <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em> gives you a non-traditional set of weapons. Your most basic one is a stake-firing sniper rifle where your alt-fire is just a scoped zoom, but you’ve also got <em>the magic wand.&nbsp;</em>This acts like a cutesy gravity gun and pulls the nearest heavy object toward you so you can blast it at your enemy of choice. There’s also an uzi-style bubble gun where the alt fire lays down a barrage of harmless pink bubbles, and a single shot from your primary fire or any other weapon sets them all off in a beautiful cascading explosion. Finally, you’ve got a three-round shotgun with my favourite alt-fire of all – shoot out a slowly floating disco ball, and then hit it with your primary fire to cause gunfire and shrapnel to rain out in every direction. There’s also a heavy-hitting railgun you find later in the game, but by the time I found it, I was pretty set with the rest of my arsenal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you only get about 4 hours of campaign missions to spend firing these incredible guns and fiddling with the so-so movement options before the campaign wraps up. After that, there’s nothing else. No challenges, no endless waves, no remixed missions. It’s a short-but-sweet campaign, but the lack of any replayability at all is a bit of a bummer. All in all, though, I’m not sure how much I would have been clamouring to re-play <em>Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</em>. While there are so many fun ideas here, there’s a lack of polish across so many areas of the game that keep those ideas from shining as much as I wanted them to.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/turtle-beach-rematch-wireless-controller-for-switch-2-a-solid-dependable-pad-if-rumble-isnt-a-must</link>
            <guid>1436113</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="b8488ed239f00"><a title="Turtle Beach Rematch Switch 2 Review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b8488ed239f00/turtle-beach-rematch-switch-2-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Turtle Beach's original Rematch Wireless is what I'd call a decent and dependable budget pad, and around what you'd expect for your money. It looked and felt surprisingly premium in its buttons, its responsive D-Pad, and in its many different designs.</p>
<p>Now, Turtle Beach is back with the cunningly-named 'Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller For Switch 2', which brings pretty much exactly the same fully-licensed controller back to the table. Except! This time it's got a flashy new design featuring Mario (never heard of him) and some flash semi-translucent grips. Oh yes. Much more importantly, though, it's also got itself a 'C' button. Yes, that weird little button that I've never used. It has one of those!</p>

<p>I jest, of course. I'm sure lots of people are having a great time with the chat functions and whatnot on Switch 2, and this revamp gives us a controller, still in the same budget ballpark (£54.99), that feels like a nice alternative to the more expensive official Pro Controller 2 from Nintendo if £75 is out of your price range.</p>
<p>I alternated between the Switch 2 Pro Controller and this new Rematch for my review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> (as they are the only C-button-wielding pads I own, and that's how you do science, you see) and obviously the big difference here is that lack of rumble support. It's one of those things I really struggle to do without nowadays, especially when you can feel the difference in shots and power. But taking this omission as a given, I've been mostly impressed by the rest of both the build quality and the overall feel of this pad.</p>
<p>It's got stiffer face buttons than the Pro Controller which feel good in their own way - very responsive and firm, there's no mistake in pressing them and no mushiness. They're a nice match for a robust D-pad that sits up nicely from the controller face and clicks through its points more noticeably than the more expensive Pro. It's personal preference with a lot of this stuff, but I do appreciate being able to feel every point being reached so I don't ever have to check my bearings as I play, especially in fighting games.</p>

<p>In terms of weight, as this is a USB-C-charged affair with no removable battery, and given the lack of rumble tech in there, it feels very light. Again, I'm actually a big fan because my wrists are made of haunted dust, but it does feel slightly 'cheaper' (because it is?) than the Pro.</p>
<p>Speaking of the battery, the official details tell me you get 40 hours on a single charge, and being that I've played an entire review game with it and just one other pad, and with no recharges required, I'm gonna go ahead and say I definitely got 30+ hours out of that single charge thus far.</p>
<p>The TMR sticks feel great, as expected, the home and screenshot buttons are well-placed just above your menu buttons, and that all-important 'C' button takes centre stage, because why wouldn't it? I should also mention that I love the big red clacky extra buttons on the back. They feel a little less primo than the dinky little hidden ones on the Pro Controller, but they are much easier to find and to tell that you've pressed on them at all. The Pro is a little mushy in this regard.</p>
<p>In your hands, the Rematch is bigger on its rear side and slightly flatter on the front than the Pro, which makes for a better grip overall for me, and between the two I also have to give this pad the nod for its triggers. I love the shape of these, as they flick upwards rather than tailing off like the ones on the Pro, making them easier to find blind and, well, they just feel more 'trigger-y', meaning your finger stays on there and doesn't start sliding when things get intense in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> or what have you.</p>

<p>Other things of note. You can use this controller with your OG Switch. There's no 3.5mm jack. Boo! But there are motion controls smuggled in to sweeten the deal. Hooray! Well. Sort of hooray.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with this thoroughly decent controller, you see, is that for just a <em>little</em> bit extra cash, you could nab something better. If you're on a super-duper strict budget, or simply must have this design in your collection, things are different, but considering this one is retailing at <a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/rematch-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2">£54.99 on the official site</a> and I could pick up the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8BitDo Pro 3</a> for less with a little searching, it gets complicated fast. The Pro 3 gives you TMR sticks, Hall-Effect Triggers, <em>and</em> rumble support. You see the issue. Even if you don't like the Dualshock-apeing style of the Pro 3, there's also the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-ultimate-no-but-decent-doesnt-have-the-same-ring">Ultimate Wireless/Bluetooth 2</a> to consider, which again I can find online for similar money right now.</p>

<p>This controller can't wake up the console, and it also has no rumble/amiibo-scanner to boot. So, whilst you get a nice licensed pad that feels great, looks great, plays great, and has got that C-button, it's possible to get alternatives with other bells and whistles for cheaper.</p>
<p>If you love the livery or if that C-button is a must for your amazingly social gaming lifestyle, then this is a very solid pad, so long as you can make do with the omissions I've noted.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/savvy-games-group-acquire-mobile-legends-moonton/</link>
            <guid>1436107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ByteDance, the parent company of the sensational (and at times, controversial) social video app, TikTok, is preparing to make one hell of a transaction. In recent reports, it was claimed that the final stages of selling <strong>Moonton </strong>to Saudi Arabia’s Savvy Games Group were closing in.</p>



<p>The deal, worth as much as <strong>$7</strong> <strong>billion,</strong> would see Savvy acquire one of the biggest mobile games in the business, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. It’s a billion-dollar game with almost 110 million monthly users, and by viewership, it’s the number one mobile esports game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-savvy-games-group-buying-moonton">Is Savvy Games Group Buying Moonton?</h2>



<p>Per a recent report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Reuters</a>, ByteDance is preparing to sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/moonton/" id="2766">Moonton</a> for something between $6 billion and $7 billion, and the buyer is none other than Savvy Games Group. Moonton, which is based in Shanghai, is responsible for the creation of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a free-to-play MOBA that has been around for almost a decade.</p>



<p>The report, published on February 13th by Reuters, suggests that the deal would contribute to ByteDance’s <strong>major retreat</strong> from the gaming space. It was back in 2021 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tiktok/" id="1219">ByteDance</a> acquired Moonton, paying around $4 billion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mobile-legends/" id="1640">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a> is said to have around 110 million monthly active users and, in the last decade, has racked up 1.5 billion unique installations. It’s one of the highest-earning mobile games ever made, and it’s the bedrock of a mobile esports ecosystem that draws in tens of millions of viewers a year.</p>



<p>With Saudi Arabia getting deeper into both the gaming and esports industries, the deal makes perfect sense, especially with the recent growth of the mobile esports space.</p>

		<p>It’d be a brave person to suggest to their other half that they’d like to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> as a Valentine’s Day game. Yes, it’s co-op, but you’re also running and sneaking through the world trying to avoid horrifying modified animal monstrosities. Then again, maybe that’s preferable to the tensions that head-to-head game of tennis can bring, even if’s a bright, colourful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a> game. Maybe it’s best for couples to avoid both of this week’s biggest releases?</p>

			<p>For a long time, the episodic adventure game as established by Telltale Games has been declared dead and buried. Which is a shame, because at their peak, Telltale produced some of my favourite ever games; The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead – Season 1, heck, I even have a weird soft spot for mega-flop Batman: The Telltale Series. So, I was delighted as much as anyone when Dispatch released last year to rave reviews and went on to sell millions of copies. Conclusively proving that the episodic choose-your-own-adventure narrative formula still had an audience, fans just needed a decent game that released on time and to schedule for them to reach for their credit cards again. And surely Switch gamers would love a slice of that too, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Well yes, of course they would, but maybe not like this. If you’ve glanced at the score before reading this review, please, let me reassure you, I don’t think for one moment that Dispatch is only a slightly better than average game. You see, Dispatch itself is great. The problem lay elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch | Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/flCnsbSrYuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For those who haven’t heard of Dispatch, it’s basically a modestly interactive feature-length animation divided into eight episodes. Segmenting the story are a series of puzzle elements. The first sees retired superhero Robert Robertson the Third in his new job as a superhero dispatcher, though he’s tasked with sending a group of reformed supervillains to time sensitive emergencies. Looking at a map screen, you assess the crises before sending the best member of the Z-Team to deal with the problem. This is a pleasant enough diversion but is lightweight and far too easy, with the game signalling so blatantly which member of your hero squad to use that you really can’t fail.</p>
<p>The second puzzle element involves hacking into various computers, which is far more interesting. You guide your hacking bot through a veritable maze, dodging viruses and cracking codes as you go. With mechanics that meaningly develop from episode to episode, this is a challenging and satisfying mini game, with genuine thrills delivered by racing against time to rescue one of your teammates, hack into a safe, or access some vital CCTV footage.</p>


<p>The story of Dispatch is brilliantly told, it’s a delightful superhero yarn providing memorable characters, whip-smart dialogue, laugh out loud tomfoolery, and some surprisingly emotional moments too. Voice over performances are off-the-chart fantastic, with a veritable who’s who of actors delivering the most believable and absorbing dialogue I’ve ever experienced in a video game. Visually, Dispatch looks phenomenal too, with slick sumptuous visuals and smooth animation, ensuring the characters will live on in your memory long after the story has finished.</p>
<p>Less successful? Well, there’s the slightly pathetic QTE inputs during fight scenes, that are so half-hearted they feel like an afterthought. Then there are the dialogue choices themselves. Now, this genre has always required a hefty amount of smoke and mirrors for the player to believe that any of their choices really matter. That was true in The Walking Dead and it’s true in Dispatch. More often than not, whatever time-sensitive dialogue option you make, the story briefly deviates from its prescribed path before re-joining the overall narrative again. Nothing really changes, certainly nothing important. Dispatch suffers from the fact that most of the choices you make are so blatantly inconsequential that you can just leave the game to play itself and you’ll make it to the end of the episode unscathed. But every now and again, the game throws an absolute dozy of a moral choice at the player; and these are worth the price of admission alone. When Dispatch finally stops pulling its punches, it hits hard, resulting in the kind of uncomfortable ethical moments that will prompt hours of conversation between players, just what did you decide to do?</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch conversion is excellent, playing equally well docked or handheld. So, what’s the big problem? As you might have already gathered if you’d paid attention over the last couple of weeks, it’s all down to the bizarre censorship.</p>

<p>Dispatch is an adult game. It’s eighteen-rated and explores grown-up themes. It’s violent, sweary, and includes full-frontal nudity and sex scenes. Unfortunately, it’s the last of these two distinctly adult things that is getting the redacted documents treatment with some of the clumsiest censoring we’ve ever seen. You know how beautiful the visuals and animation of Dispatch are? We’ll get ready for them to be ruined by enormous black censorship rectangles being stuck on top of them!</p>
<p>A character raises a middle finger? Well, dear person over eighteen, you’re not permitted to see that – look at a big black censorship rectangle instead. Someone’s naked bum is revealed? I’m afraid, person over eighteen, despite you having a bum too, you can’t see that. Breasts? That’s not OK either. A flaccid penis? Simply unacceptable. That’s right, natural bits of a human body cannot be looked at, but gratuitous swearing and bloody violence are apparently not a problem.</p>
<p>The reason for the censorship is a little unclear, with AdHoc saying <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">they worked with Nintendo to meet platform ‘content criteria’</a>, Nintendo then saying AdHoc could have taken a different approach <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">so long as games meet guidelines for ratings bodies</a>, and AdHoc then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">not exactly explaining what happened or if there’s a real path forward</a>. The speculation is that a single version of the game was submitted for all regions, meaning that they adhered to the CERO D rating in Japan and that this version was shipped everywhere. Other games, like Cyberpunk 2077, have multiple versions, but even with a single global approach, the method here is far too heavy-handed.</p>
<p>AdHoc Studio could have elected to edit the scenes in question, they could have chosen to pixelate or blur, but instead they elected to stick black rectangles everywhere, taking the player out of the moment entirely. One moment, I kid you not, the entire screen was covered in one enormous rectangle. The effect of this decision is calamitous; jokes are regularly ruined and it becomes difficult to tell what’s going on sometimes. Worse still, an incredibly affecting twist in the penultimate episode is entirely ruined by the big black censorship rectangle of doom. With Dispatch on Switch, AdHoc Studio had an open goal. Somehow, they’ve managed to perform an elaborate bicycle kick and hoofed the proverbial football into their own net.</p>
<p>While we hope there is some kind of remedy for this down the line, there’s no real indication that there will be.</p>

Yes, it's the weekend, and we're gazing at our stack of games with wistful longing. We can't let them go unplayed, can we?</p>
<p>Before we dive into what we're booting up, however, let's take a look at the last week. Our headline review was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, but we also checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was greedy and wrapped up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> way quicker than I was expecting last weekend, so I am officially <em>Between Games TM</em> at the moment. I’ve been enjoying working my way through some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario’s Super Picross</a> on the NSO library to chill out, and I imagine this weekend will bring more of the same!</p>
<p>While I can’t really believe that I’m saying it, I’m also quite keen to check out some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Overwatch</a> this weekend. I missed the boat when it first launched, but all of this new content has me intrigued.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This week, I have jetlag. I tried to play games that required even a little bit of brain, and it did not go well (it was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, for the record. Not even a particularly cerebral game! I'm just very tired).</p><p>

I've been making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>, as I will be for the rest of my life, and now I'm somewhere around 25 endings. Maybe more. Also, <strong>Titanium Court</strong>, which is not out yet, but I have an early code because I'm a jammy lad, and it's VERY good, so look forward to that one (although... I'm not sure if it's due out on Switch. Sorry). Also, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> (which IS out on Switch, and you should play it) and watching my partner play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a>, after a year of me going PLAY IT PLAY IT PLAY IT. So that's very fun.</p><p>

But I'm looking for something meaty to play after finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Another JRPG, perhap? Recommendations always welcome.</p></div>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I’ve not had much time to play this week as I’ve been under the weather, however I predict this weekend will be spent gaming in bed. It’s only fitting with it being Valentine’s Day on Saturday that my fiancee and I replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> together.</p>
<p>Saying that, I’m still on the mission of becoming less of a wimp and with the recent <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> trailer, I might just jump into a horror game from my backlog. I’m sure I can dust off something from my collection. Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4</a> on Wii? Wish me luck…I think motion controls are scarier than Las Plagas!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still completely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> at the moment, though I did briefly test out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> after its recent update, and I can confirm that MGS2 and 3 now run like a dream on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So yes, it's likely that I'll be spending a bit of time with Solid and Naked Snake this weekend, playing their two best adventures as intended. It took a while, but Konami finally pulled through.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-maelstrom-lair-of-tyrant-review-pirate-vs-pirate</link>
            <guid>1436074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Maelstrom is a part of the <em>40K</em> universe where real space meets the madness of the Warp. The area is in constant flux, which makes it the perfect hiding place for xenos, heretics, traitors, and the various pirate raiders that call it home. Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">500 Worlds Titus</a> books, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant brings a new campaign, new enemies, and pushes the narrative one step closer to something huge for <em>Warhammer 40K</em>. In this article, we check out the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books, and the new pirate forces of the Red Corairs and Eldritch Raiders.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules, or the most recent wave of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crux-terminatus-battleforce-marneus-calgar-and-friends-review-codex-compliant" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Ultramarines and Space Marine reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p>The Maelstrom is a large region of space that several factions share. The largest force of inhabitants is the Red Corsairs under Huron Blackheart. Huron was once a loyal Space Marine of the Emperor, now a traitor, and commander of his own vast legion of ships that he uses to plunder the Imperium, the xenos, and even other Chaos Space Marine factions.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron suffers others to share the Maelstrom, simply because he either hasn't gotten around to eliminating them yet, they're proving hard to remove, or their presence offers him and his forces something they need. One of these threats, who sees the riches of the Maelstrom as ripe to plunder, along with Huron's resources and fleets, are the Aeldari Corsairs, the Eldritch Raiders. These two corsair factions share much in common, with their members made up of those who leave the structured formats of their previous lives, for plunder and destruction, free from the constraints of laws and moral codes.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Campaign Books</h2><p>The Maelstrom is a lawless place, full of factions vying for power, wealth, and plunder. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books bring to life this area of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> universe, with background and lore, new units and army compositions, and a new campaign. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant is a set of 4 linked books, the first details the background for the Maelstrom, and the forces it contains, focusing on the Chaos Space Marines, the Red Corsairs led by Huron Blackheart, and the Aeldari, Eldritch Raiders led by Prince Yriel.</p><p>The second book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant - Crucible of Champions, lets you build a unique champion for your faction, with options to build 62 different champions across 21 factions, with additional options for 4 specific Space Marine chapters (Space Wolves, Dark Angels, Blood Angels, and Black Templars). Each included faction has 3 archetypes (except Drukhari, who have 2) to begin building your champion. Once selected, you add in a specialism, ability, and weapons to complete the build.</p><p>We built a Raven Guard Champion of the Chapter, with a heavy jump pack and Mk X Gravis armor, the tactical precision ability to make them accurate with the Forge Boltter we armed them with, and topped it off with a Power Fist in case they need to engage in close combat.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The third book, The Malestrom Raid and Ruin, includes a campaign for players to simulate warlords vying for power in the Maelstrom. Players in Raid and Ruin campaigns fight to gain notoriety points (NP) across 7 different challenges, like destroying your opponent's warlord in a battle. The first time you do this, you gain the Vengeful title and 3 NP, and by the third time you complete it, you gain the Imperious title, and your NP count rises to 5. The player with the most NP at the end of the campaign wins.</p><p>But being a space pirate isn't just about fame and glory, there are spoils to be taken too, and for each objective you control at the end of the battle, you can roll on the Spoils of War table. You can only choose to keep one result, of which there are 36 spoils of war to be won, and you keep it until the end of the next battle, when you will get the opportunity to roll again if you score objectives. Some of the spoils grant you bonus NP at the end of a battle, others special abilities like the Chart of Shadows that lets you bring a unit out of strategic reserves earlier, and the rest are weapons, like the Tyrant's Sceptre, which has 5 attacks, Ap -2, 3 damage, and strength equal to your NP.</p><p>The final book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tryant - Detachments, is a booklet with new Detachments for Chaos Space Marines (Huron's Marauders and Renegade Warband), Aeldari (Eldritch Raiders and Corsir Coterie), Orks (Freebooter Krew), and the Leagues of Votann (Mercenary Oathband). All of these Detachments are available in the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/warhammer-40000/" rel="nofollow">downloads section</a> of the Warhammer Community site. Detachments are new with this edition of <em>40K</em> and give unique special rules for your forces, significantly changing the way factions play between detachment choices, and usually some restrictions on the units you can take.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Red Corsairs</h2><p>Alongside the Maelstrom campaign books, the Red Corsairs sail into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> with 2 new boxes, Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom, and the Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom is a box similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">Titus and the Wardens of Ultramar</a>, in that it contains the character Huron, who can deploy by himself, or attached to the rest of his retinue and another unit. Huron boosts the objective control of nearby Heretic Astartes infantry units and comes armed with the Tyrant's Claw and exalted power weapon, which have 6 attacks, strength 8, -3 AP, and 3 damage.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-lair-of-the-tyrant-4.jpg?itok=sChsyQyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom are a 5-model unit that contains 3 Chaos Space Marine specialists, a xenos, and a human fleet officer. They all come on a single datasheet, but each adds their own unique ability. The 3 Chaos Space Marines are Garreon, an apothecary who can return removed models to his unit or gain CP if a nearby unit is below starting strength. Garrix, a character hunter, comes armed with the Axe of Ending, which has anti-character 2+, scoring critical wounds on a roll of 2 or more, and precision, so they can target characters, even if they're hiding within a unit. Garlon, a psyker, whose Mind Wrench power also has precision to target characters, with 1 attack, -2AP, and D6+1 damage.</p><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom xenos is The Enforcer, a Tarellian, a race that has been mentioned several times in 40K lore, but doesn't have a faction of their own. The Enforcer can release her Barghesi companion (which also gets a miniature in the box), that once per battle, deals D3+1 mortal wounds to a unit within 12 inches, on a 2+. The final member of the Masters is Captain Sargotta, who allows you to redeploy up to 3 units from your force after deployment, better placing them to deal with the enemy threats after seeing their placement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce allows you to kickstart your Red Corsairs army, and includes a new Reave-Captain and 10x Red Corsairs Raiders, alongside 10x Legionaries, 5x Terminators, and 10x Traitor Guardsmen, which can all be upgraded with the included Red Corsairs upgrade kit (which has 5 Terminator and 10 Legionnaire shoulder pads and some new head and arm options) and transfers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Red Corsairs Raiders are experienced pirates, used to surging forward to plunder. This is represented through the infiltrator's special rule, which lets them set up further ahead of the rest of the force, and an objective control of 2, which rises to 3 after they destroy an enemy unit. They also have 3 wounds each, and for every 5 models, can add a power fist and melta gun to the unit, to give them some real staying power on objectives.</p><p>Leading the Lords of the Maelstrom is the new Reave-Captain, who loves to get into combat. After they charge, for the rest of the turn, their melee weapons gain 1 to strength and armor penetration, and they can reroll the charge roll if the target is within range of an objective marker. They can also join Raider units, and come with the infiltrators' special rule so they can set up ahead of the main army with them. They come armed with a power sword and bolt pistol, which you can swap for a power maul, which loses 2 attacks to the power sword but does double the damage, and a plasma pistol, which is just superior in every way to a bolt pistol.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eldritch Raiders</h2><p>Trying to out-pirate the Red Corsairs and releasing alongside them are the Aeldari Eldritch Raiders, led by Prince Yriel in a new battleforce. The Eldritch Raiders Battleforce contains a whole host of new miniatures, including a new miniature for Prince Yriel and a new Vyper, the brand new units Kharseth and 10x Corsair Skyreavers, and 10x of the existing Corsair Voidscarred.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-lair-of-the-tyrant-8.jpg?itok=huFRRHpy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Prince Yriel can join either of the units that come in the box, and has a Piratical Hero ability that makes it easier for the unit he's in to hit and deal extra damage when they roll critical hits. Yriel is also pretty devastating in combat themselves, with the Spear of Twilight giving Yriel 5 attacks at strength 7, -3 AP, and dealing 3 damage. Accompanying Yriel is the Void Dreamer Kharseth, who can also join both units in the battleforce. Kharseth has an anti-infantry psychic attack with D6+2 attacks, which, along with dealing damage for the attack, can give a unit that it hits the Riven status, which increases the strength of attacks by Aledari units against them.</p><p>The new Corsair Skyreavers are crazy fast, with Scout 7 to get them moving straight away, and then a standard move of 12 inches. For every 5 models in the unit, you can take 2 special weapons from a selection of 4 (with no duplicates with 5 models, and a max of 2 per weapon at 10 models). They also have a Raid and Ruin special ability that lets them move D3+3 inches if not in combat at the end of the fight phase, or fall back D3+3 inches if they are in combat, making them very difficult to pin down, as you can withdraw ready to relocate next turn.</p><picture>

<p>Apart from a new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, Capcom's new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> also made an appearance at PlayStation's 'State of Play' this week.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer titled 'World View' gives us another glimpse at a recreation of New York, and also adds some backstory about the game's protagonist Hugh. This trailer ends on a bit of a shocking note, with Hugh and his android companion Diana being chased by an enemy threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hugh and Diana as they traverse a 3D printed Times Square-like area, dominated by massive structures. What mysteries await them in this twisted lunar cityscape?"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already tried it out, there's a demo for Pragmata on the Switch 2 eShop that you can download right now. Capcom also announced earlier this week that this same demo has now reached one million "combined" downloads across all platforms.</p>
<p>This new hacking and shooting game will arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>24th April 2026</strong>. Will you be picking it up on release? Have you tried out the demo yet? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pinball-machine-officially-revealed-by-stern-pinball-available-now</link>
            <guid>1436032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>As part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations, Stern Pinball has now officially revealed its new Pokémon pinball machine.</p>
<p>It's available right now in "pro", "premium" and "limited edition" models. The limited edition is "limited" to 750 units globally, and prices range between $6,999 - $12,999, depending on the model. If you're interested, or happen to be a business owner, you can <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">contact Stern on its website</a> to find out about the availability of these machines and more details.</p>

<p>This machine promises to take trainers on an "unforgettable journey" across four distinct habitats as they battle their way through rival trainers and Team Rocket. It also integrates video clips from the original animated series, including the official theme song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game begins with the player entering a random biome: forest, water, mountain, or desert. By hitting the ball at the proper targets on the board, you’ll discover, catch, and train new Pokémon partners. Occasionally, you’ll encounter the troublesome Team Rocket, and you’ll need to prevent them from capturing Pokémon during a frantic multiball sequence.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve scored enough points and completed specific activities in a biome, you’ll be able to take on a Gym Battle against a rival party of Pokémon. Complete all the biomes’ Gym Battles, and you’ll enter the Pokémon Arena. There’s even an opportunity to face off against Team Rocket’s boss, Giovanni, but only the most skilled pinball wizards are likely to make it that far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premium and limited edition versions of the machine also feature an interactive electromagnet that "adds chaos" to the battle arena.</p>
<p>As part of the whole experience, trainers can use Stern's app to document the Pokémon they catch. Here's a bit about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilizing Stern Pinball’s award-winning Insider Connected, <em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball elevates the experience by connecting Trainers and their adventures across machines and locations. When Trainers play Pokémon by Stern Pinball signed in with their Stern Insider Connected Account, the Pokémon they CATCH will be added to their Insider Connected Pokémon Collection, which can be viewed in the Insider Connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're curious to see it in action, <a href="https://youtu.be/mJKxHwMiCJM">YouTube channel The Pinball Company</a> has gone hands on with the new Pokémon machine. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-g8SDhfWVc">YouTube channel Foxcitiespinball</a> has also uploaded a video of the Stern team explaining the new machine and the design.</p>

<p>YAPYAP sold half 1 million games in its first week on the market.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yapyap/" id="3501">YAPYAP,</a> a co-op horror game where players use microphones to cast magic spells and wreak havoc in enemy wizards’ towers, was released on Steam in early February 2026. Within a week of its release, the game had sold 500,000 copies. This is despite the game still smoothing out some rough edges.</p>



<h2 id="h-maison-bap-reacts-to-yapyap-s-major-milestone">Maison Bap Reacts to YAPYAP’s Major Milestone</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/maison-bap/" id="3502">Maison Bap</a>, the game’s publisher and developer, shared a message of gratitude upon reaching the milestone. They noted that over the coming weeks, they will continue to fix bugs and polish the game. They will then focus on additional content once all edges are smoothed.</p>



<p>“We also know many of you are eager to hear about future updates, but before jumping into new features and content, we want to make sure the game is fully stable and smooth for everyone. Once that’s locked in, we’ll start planning the fun stuff,” the team said in a message that was shared on Steam on February 9.</p>



<p>The game is still on a small introductory discount. It is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">Steam for $7.99.</a></p>

            <guid>1435972</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Hell is not other people. Hell is yourself.” - Ludwig Wittgenstein</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It begins with a group of children looking down a hole. A boy in a hood, the remains of a hangman’s noose around his neck, pilots a boat adrift at sea. I do not know where he has come from or where he is going or if he was one of the ones staring into that well’s abyss. I only know the way forward. Red lights peak through the dark and fog. They are my compass, and I follow them. Buoys. Where they guide me, I do not know, but there is no other path. The ocean is so vast, and my boat is so small. For a time, I am alone. At the fourth buoy, the boy stops the boat and pulls aboard a girl. When he reaches for the hare mask covering her face, she pins him to the small outboard’s wooden bottom, her hands ripping at his mask until he kicks her away. They stare at each other from opposite ends of the boat. It might as well be a chasm. “I thought you were dead,” the boy offers. “Where are the others?” the girl asks. The boy doesn’t know. She takes a lantern and stands at our boat’s bow. The buoys are still our guide, but the girl lights the way forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time I reach the end of Reanimal, the latest horror puzzle platformer from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review">Little Nightmares</a> developer Tarsier, I have forgotten all of this, and lost track of what parts of this opening are most important. I am too busy trying to make meaning from what I have seen, too focused on trying to connect the pieces of Reanimal’s puzzle, to understand how we got here. But stories, at least the good ones, the ones that know what they’re doing, tell you what they’re about from the beginning. And Reanimal is a very good story. Remember this, it tells you. Remember <em>all of this</em>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Together – I play the boy, my co-op partner plays the girl. There is no way to select who plays who; it simply works out this way – we sail through jagged cliffs, past mines larger than our boat, bisect a forest of jagged, barren trees. Then the banks of the river we have followed fade, and a large industrial building looms out of the fog ahead of us. It is a remarkable image in a game of remarkable images. Reanimal certainly knows how to set a scene. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is very little overt explanation.The boy and the girl are brother and sister, but this fact is never told to you. You learn it through the way they help each other up, comfort each other when things go wrong. Their relationship is something you experience, the questions largely left for you to answer. Why does she attack him after he fishes her out of the sea? What happened to them before they were in the boat? Reanimal unspools its story slowly, and asks you to fill in the gaps yourself. To remember what you’ve seen, to put together the imagery, the symbols, notice patterns in the shapes throughout its world. I’m unsure of what they’re after until we find another child separated from us by steel bars blocking a drain pipe. “You came back,” he whispers. “I knew you would. You should leave… while you still can.” But we don’t. The girl’s earlier question is the answer to mine. We are here to save the others. Our friends.</p><p>Reanimal can be played alone, but it's more meaningful to take the journey with someone else.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We navigate broken buildings, push through dark forests, leap across gaps, crouch into places only a child can fit. Often, we need to work together. The world is so big, and we are so small. It takes two of us to lift a metal trapdoor. I hold a lever to still a rotating metal shaft so my partner can pilot the girl across. On the other side, she knocks down a piece of wood so I can cross a gap. Reanimal is simple, elegant. You walk, run, jump, interact with and carry objects, boost one another to ledges neither of you can reach alone, and occasionally fight off foes in the clumsy way a child might. Little distinguishes the boy from the girl, save that she can attach her lantern to her hip while carrying something else. The boy’s lighter, on the other hand, is only usable if his hands are free. It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one, and my partner and I often made significant choices about who would do what based on how much light it would cost us, and whether we felt we could sacrifice it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reanimal can be played alone, but I found it more meaningful to take the journey with someone else, to coordinate and work together, to congratulate ourselves on our success and discuss our failures before trying again. Like the boy and the girl on screen, we are experiencing this together. Like them, we are not alone. That subtle distinction – of working with a living, breathing person – made it much better than it would have been had I spent the whole experience with a computer-controlled girl who always did exactly what she was supposed to. That’s not what this story is about, and I am deeply grateful that, in an era which has largely abandoned local co-op, Reanimal offers it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Reanimal Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Reanimal’s gameplay and the choices it offers are satisfying, but simple. It is less a game you play and more a world you move through and experience without the obvious artifice of a video game. There is no HUD, no meters, no minimap. The camera is often fixed to show you exactly what Tasier wants you to see, and the sense of visual composition here is remarkable. Even horror can be beautiful when framed the right way. Often, the answers to the gameplay questions Reanimal presents are obvious – though not less satisfying for it – and the only way forward, though occasionally we get lost. What carries us ahead are not the puzzles themselves, but the desire to see what’s next. If you are expecting great leaps from the studio’s work on the first two Little Nightmares, you will not find it here, and I’m not bothered by that. You don’t return to your favorite restaurant angry the menu hasn’t changed, and here the chef is a master of his craft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environment is not our only obstacle. We start to notice the horrors as we search for the missing wheels to a handcar. A body leans against a wall, its belly a gaping hole left by something that forced its way out – or in. A plunger applied to a clogged toilet reveals a key and the deformed, deflated skin of what was once, perhaps, a man; his features are off, deformed, his face caught between that of a person and a pig.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we’re up against isn’t obvious until we come across the second of the wheels we need for the handcart, and the man/animal skins around us come to life, slithering after us like snakes. We do the only thing we can do: we run. It gets worse from there; the first living human we encounter is impossibly tall, his face a Halloween mask of sagging skin, empty eye sockets, a maw that is always open. He skitters after us like a spider, biting our heads off if he catches us. He is not the worst of it; not even close. We spend most of Reanimal running from something. I don’t want to say more. These are terrors you really should see for yourself. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Puzzle Games</h3><p>I just reviewed The Talos Principle 2. Here's how it stacks up against my favorite puzzle games.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/edgarallanbro/lists/wills-favorite-puzzle-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">But I can say this: the place the boy and girl have returned to is wrong. There is a theory that hell is the worst moments of your life, replayed over and over again, without ceasing, simultaneously something you recognize and fresh at the same time. What does it say that the boy and girl have seemingly returned here by choice after having escaped? “I told you to leave,” the boy we encountered tells us later. Or are they all trapped here, together, in a hell we can’t leave? Only one thing is certain: we are off the edge of the map. Here be dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue, the world opens up to us. We navigate dark forests, the flooded ruins of cities, active warzones, and until the end, whatever shattered this place is only partially clear. Our journey is only partially linear. Returning to the boat allows us to explore, to explore this flooded place and find what lies off the beaten path. It is here that Reanimal is most obviously a video game, rewarding the curious with new masks, collectible concept art, and so on, but it never feels out of place or forced, and doesn’t detract from the atmosphere. Nor does the occasional replay of a chase sequence because you don’t initially know what to do or where to go, which is enough to spell your end. Reanimal’s atmosphere, its art, its sense of place and character and mystery carry the day at every turn, through the odd confusion, annoyance, or visual bug. It compelled us to see it through to the end, to understand the tale it was trying to tell in its roughly six-hour journey through hell. I think I understand. But I know there is much we missed, and I want to return to see it through, and see what, if anything, changes as a result.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Remember this, Reanimal says as it shows you something. All the pieces matter. It is a horror story, a journey through hell made up of the simple, elegant gameplay that Tarsier has honed to a feather's edge over the last decade. There are occasional frustrations: a chase where the way forward is not obvious, a path that is easy to miss. What will keep you going is the story, the world, the characters, the sense that beyond all of this lies answers, the act of working together in a world where the scariest things are often not monsters, but other people, and what we are capable of inflicting on one another. What kept me going was playing it with another person, sharing that experience, and working together to discover what was at the bottom of that hole, and how that boy ended up in a boat, and his sister nearly drowned at sea. Going through hell together, wondering if it was something that happened to them, or the world they – we – had made.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/reanimal-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>says <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/sonic-rumble/" target="_blank">Sonic Rumble</a>&nbsp;underperformed and that, overall, the value of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/angry-birds/" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rovio-entertainment/" target="_blank">Rovio&nbsp;</a>was written down, resulting in an impairment loss of more than</span> $200 million.</p>



<p>Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company, recently <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported its Q3 earnings</a> for fiscal year 2026. Noted in the earnings that, as it pertained to Rovio’s business, there was a recognized impairment loss of approximately 31.3 billion yen. As of this writing, that amounts to about $205 million.</p>



<p>Sega completed<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/angry-birds-acquisition/" id="6935"> its acquisition of Rovio</a> in August 2023.</p>







<h2 id="h-factors-surrounding-rovio-s-underperforming-quarter">Factors Surrounding Rovio’s Underperforming Quarter</h2>



<p>In the Q3 presentation, Sega attributes Rovio’s performance falling short of initial expectations to “rapid changes in the market environment and other factors.” One of those factors was the collaborative mobile title Sonic Rumble, which struggled to meet key performance indicators.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Sega plans to reverse this momentum by focusing specifically on Angry Birds and Sega IPs, including Sonic, for future games. They also see the release of the third Angry Birds movie, set for December, as another factor driving hopeful increased traction for the brand.</p>







<h2>The Future of Sonic</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble, which is also available for free on Steam, may have underperformed, but the blue blur always bounces back. It’s Sonic’s 35th anniversary this year. So far, no official game releases have been scheduled in celebration, but the Sonic Team has put out a new audio drama in the Sonic universe. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-unveils-noir-sonic-audio-drama-the-chaotix-casefiles/" id="171225">here</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the filings, Sega announced plans to make mainstay IPs a focus not just in mobile releases but also in traditional console releases. Read more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-plans-four-major-mainstay-ip-releases-in-next-fiscal-year/" id="176620">here</a>.</p>

Buried beneath information about both MGS4 and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is a single line confirming the multiplayer offering will not return when the former finally sneaks onto more platforms this August.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-120832-1771012392399.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 website. Image captured by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This iteration of Metal Gear Online launched with MGS4 as a bundled-in multiplayer experience in June 2008. Featuring a variety of game modes that ranged from standard team deathmatch to a unique encounter that saw one player assume the role of Old Snake – the offshoot tied together elements from the fourth mainline Metal Gear Solid game for players to enjoy in an online setting. It received several post-launch expansions through the years before Konami <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/15/metal-gear-online-ending"><u>shut down the servers</u></a> in 2012.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing back MGS4 multiplayer for Master Collection Vol. 2 seems to be too tall an order for the publisher, but the second installment in its series of collections won’t be completely without an online component. Konami’s website also confirms that, unlike the first half of the bundle, its Peace Walker port will support online multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on its returning Co-Ops mode promise classic team gameplay for the Big Boss era of the series, allowing two-to-four players to complete missions together. Versus Ops is for the more competitive-minded fans and features matches for up to six players. Local wireless play is also included, but only for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the lack of Metal Gear Online support for MGS4 may come as a sad surprise for fans of the original PlayStation 3 release, other tweaks coming to the base experience may pique their interest. As described in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-launches-aug-27-2026-on-ps5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation.Blog</u></a> post, Konami said the new version of MGS4 will feature improved internal resolution, a maximum framerate increase, and customizable controls. It’s unclear if Peace Walker will also benefit from visual adjustments, but it will at least come with custom controls. Ghost Babel, a bonus Game Boy Color entry from 2000, will not see the return of its two-player Vs. Battle mode, but it will come with screen filters, pixel-perfect screen settings, a rewind function, and custom controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 has an August 27, 2026, release date for PC via Steam, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. Those who pre-order their copy will gain access to the Cardboard Camouflage for MGS4 and the Love Box unfirom for Peace Walker. If you also happen to have save data from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Vol. 1</a>, you'll earn the Gold Camouflage and Gold uniform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read about what Konami is doing to make sure it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2"><u>doesn’t suffer the same launch problems</u></a> as Vol. 1. You can also see how the publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-online-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt-has-a-release-date-fresh-update-out-now">revamped the multiplayer experience for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> with its Fox Hunt mode last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
