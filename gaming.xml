To put it another way: Shit is bad. </p><p>I say all this to make it clear that the incredible heat we are seeing right now is serious and is hurting and killing people. Obviously, the fact that I or others can’t play video games comfortably is very far down on the list of problems caused by global warming. But it is still annoying, and talking to others who are experiencing this heat, it’s clear I’m not alone.<br></p><p>I live in Kansas, where we have luckily been able to avoid some of the higher temperatures seen in places like Seattle, NYC, and the UK. Even still, in this heat, I can’t play VR games comfortably, given how sweaty and uncomfortable the headset quickly becomes. When you factor in that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-is-better-in-vr-1846609043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-is-better-in-vr-1846609043">many good VR games</a></span> ask you to stand, move around and use motion controls, the prospect becomes even less appealing.

It’s a shame because I do like playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watch-someone-destroy-beat-saber-with-a-hand-mixer-1835076175?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Socialflow&amp;utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watch-someone-destroy-beat-saber-with-a-hand-mixer-1835076175?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Socialflow&amp;utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter">VR games like <em>Beat Saber</em></a></span>; I just can’t do it while temperatures hover around or over 100.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1bc4811fd3937de3ee18bb0937130927" data-recommend-id="image://1bc4811fd3937de3ee18bb0937130927" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Man playing VR using a Oculus Rift." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man playing VR using a Oculus Rift." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Oculus / Facebook</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bc4811fd3937de3ee18bb0937130927" data-recommend-id="image://1bc4811fd3937de3ee18bb0937130927" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Man playing VR using a Oculus Rift." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not just VR that feels uncomfortable to play during these abnormally blistering times. More graphically impressive games on my PC cause extra heat to build up in my tiny home office. Consoles also spit out a shocking amount of hot air when you play games that push the hardware. The Xbox Series X, in particular, is very effective at expelling burning hot air at a rapid rate. This is very good for the console, of course. But it also means that I have a mini-jet engine cooking me alive. At least it’s quiet while I melt.<br></p><p>I spoke to some friends who are experiencing similar issues. Some of them are avoiding certain games on specific platforms right now because it’s too damn hot, and because running your AC all day is expensive and bad for the environment. I personally try to limit how often I run our apartment’s AC system, and if I can save some money and electricity by skipping some sessions of <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> that seems like a good trade-off.</p><p>And sure, as those folks on that once-popular show often said, “Winter is coming.” Well, first fall, <em>then </em>winter. The point is: Cooler and colder days are not too far away. But as these extreme shifts in weather and climate become more common and more extreme every year, I expect the summer months to become an even worse time to use electronics that produce tons of heat. </p><p>Of course, as things get worse, being able to play games comfortably will probably become one of my lower priorities behind things like finding water, staying cool, and fighting off roving bandits hunting down any resources they can find. Still, I’ll miss playing video games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling the long-running debate about whether Call of Duty skins have well and truly gone off the deep end, Beavis and Butt-Head are heading to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beavis and Butt-Head are perhaps the poster boys of the MTV generation and genuine 90s cartoon icons. Created by Mike Judge, Beavis and Butt-Head are two idiotic teen slackers who sit around grunting and giggling at rock music on MTV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has form when it comes to 90s-themed skins, so perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to see Beavis and Butt-Head finally get their moment in the shooter. But what is perhaps surprising is how their skins look, which is a jarring combination of the cartoon style fans know Beavis and Butt-Head for, but wearing MilSim outfits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Mike Judge’s Beavis &amp; Butt-Head are coming to Call of Duty Season 04 Reloaded 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/3QnIYMv2AN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3QnIYMv2AN</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1937194237554295005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Of all the collabs to get military-themed outfits in this game, I definitely did not see Beavis and Butt-Head getting one,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1limd1t/comment/mzd1p8m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor RdJokr1993</a>. “Lol these are unironically more MilSim than most skins in the game,” added LoneRogue2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are coming up with on-brand one-liners we might hear Beavis and Butt-Head say in-game. For example: “Heh heh heh heh, he said 'Duty.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Beavis and Butt-Head shouldn’t come as any surprise to anyone who’s played Call of Duty in the last few years. This is a game that has the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a Dragon Knight that looks straight out of Skyrim, and, more recently, a skin made from strips of bacon, all running around realistic, war-torn environments. Activision releases these sorts of skins and players complain about realism, but they sell enough for Activision to keep releasing these sorts of skins. And so the cycle continues.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question will be how much Beavis and Butt-Head cost. Activision has come under fire recently for its ultra aggressive monetization of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, with some players complaining about the high price of bundles, the introduction of event passes, and ever more expensive battle passes. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash">Activision pulled controversial adverts placed inside Black Ops 6 and Warzone loadouts</a>, insisting they were a “feature test” published “in error.” It’s worth remembering that Black Ops 6 is a premium, $70 game, and this year’s Black Ops 7 is set to jump to $80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And will this Beavis and Butt-Head skin carry forward into the recently announced Black Ops 7? Activision has yet to say. But given the timing of its release, the hope is that anyone who forks out for Beavis and Butt-Head will get bang for their buck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Call of Duty players are speculating that getting a headshot against Beavis and Butt-Head might be a little easier than against other skins in the game. Is this a pay-to-lose bundle?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Good luck to those sitting on them headies… 💀 <a href="https://t.co/U4nd9l8PxS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U4nd9l8PxS</a></p>— Team WaR (@OfficialTeamWaR) <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialTeamWaR/status/1937196728785993828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know when the Season 4 Reloaded mid-season update is set to launch exactly, but based on how many days players have left to complete the Season 4 battle pass, it should be released on or around June 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> was visually arresting when it launched on PS4, taking Guerrilla's Decima Engine and applying it in ways not explored by the studio's Horizon series. With the sequel, Kojima Productions has yet again delivered a game that pushes boundaries visually, with some key enhancements on some of the engine's improvements we've already seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2</a> crams a lot of detail into its gorgeously sparse open world, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-death-stranding-2-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noting how high the image quality is and how far details stretch out before having to taper off to keep performance in check. It makes static images of Death Stranding 2 look pristine and almost life-like, with that illusion maintained in motion. Digital Foundry notes how impressive the various weather effects in the game are, with specific mention of how water physics have been improved on over Horizon's implementation to account for more dynamic behavior for gameplay purposes. You can watch the full technical breakdown below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApWCtAuKcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ApWCtAuKcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In testing, Death Stranding 2 sticks to its two performance targets, staying locked to either 30 or 60 frames per second depending on the mode you chose on PS5 or PS5 Pro. Better yet, choosing performance mode on either console runs the game inside a 120Hz container on supported displays, offering more responsive inputs in tandem with the dependable performance.</p><p>Differences between Sony's two consoles aren't as stark as you might expect, with both aiming for 1440p outputs and using the Decima Engine's own approach to upscaling to 4K. Digital Foundry notes that this causes some image instability on the original PS5 where the image looks cleaner on the PS5 Pro, perhaps thanks to the more powerful console sticking closer to a native 1440p most of the time.</p><p>The bigger differences are between the Quality and Performance modes on PS5, which Digital Foundry notes have enough of a gulf between them that players might prefer the lower framerate albeit shaper quality mode. On PS5 Pro, the difference between the two is so imperceptible that the publication suggests just sticking with the Performance mode.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is out soon for players who have ordered the game's Deluxe Edition, granting 48 hours early access before the game launches for everyone on 26 June. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a>, writer Diego Nicolás Argüello notes that the sequel sticks too closely to its predecessor at times, writing, "This second iteration doesn't feel as arresting as it mired in familiar story beats, a disappointing lack of friction, and an obsession with doubling down on the weaker aspects of Death Stranding."</p>

To date, my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> experience has largely consisted of building an ungainly box and hanging from the ceiling in my underwear. But more driven players have already barrelled their way to the endgame, where its "extremely competitive" PvP focus has become something of a concern for PvE players. Enter developer Funcom, which reckons it might have found a solution.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening's endgame, if you're unfamiliar, is focused on the Deep Desert. This vast, ever-shifting landscape is where players can venture in search of valuable resources and endgame gear as they make a grasp for factional supremacy, and one that's reset every week by Coriolis storms. It's also PvP-focused - a design decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">Funcom has previously stood firm on</a>, even as Ornithopters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">rained down from above</a>. Now, though, Dune: Awakening creative director Joel Bylos has admitted the system isn't quite working in the way the team had hoped.
</p>
<p>
"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert," he explained in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">newly shared developer blog</a>. "The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert... The reality is that players are reporting being cut out of the endgame due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert.

<p>
This runs counter to the team's vision, according to Bylos. "We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame. Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in."
</p>
<p>
As such, Funcom is introducing Partial Warfare (PvE) zones to the Deep Desert where players can explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without being forced into conflict with other players. However, Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields will remain War of Assassins (PvP) flagged. "The deepest parts of the Deep Desert," Bylos continued, "will remain as they currently are - high reward, high risk areas."
</p>
<p>
"The beauty of the Deep Desert design with weekly resets and renewals," he added, "is that we can iterate and experiment with different layouts and setups to really help us tune it. As we make changes we will send out surveys to help us capture your thoughts."
</p>
<p>
On top of that, Bylos acknowledged a variety of issues impacting PvP. Some of these relate to Ornithopters, which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">dominated Dune: Awakening's endgame</a> ever since players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">realised they could drop them on other people's heads</a>. Scout Ornithopters will see a range of changes, which Funcom details in its blog, as will other mechanics the studio believes are being "abused", including respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, and hand scanners.
</p>
<p>
"The intended dynamic of Deep Desert PvP" Bylos noted, "is that - unless you really mess up - you always have the option to retreat in good order with whatever you've managed to claim so far. If you're smart and vigilant, you never <em>have to</em> fight if you don't want to. If you run, you'll have to call a halt to whatever task you were pursuing, but that should always be a choice. PvP should happen when both parties decide they want to fight over a location."
</p>
<p>
And finally, Bylos had a few words to say on Dune: Awakening's Landsraad design, admitting this endgame "framework" still has a number of "key flaws". Funcom is currently looking at addressing some of these, including the "inability to hand in items after a square is completed and the rapidity at which some squares are turned in", alongside stockpiling, which is currently being unintentionally rewarded. Additionally, the studio will be introducing Landsraad "micro rewards" for solo/small group players. 
</p>
<p>
"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us – our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy." And by all accounts, Dune: Awakening - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">gave four stars in our review</a> - currently has a lot of everybodys, what with having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">already hurtled passed 1m sales</a>.

			<p>When you think of Cyberpunk 2077, the game's romances may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they are still worth highlighting as possibly the best RPG romances, at least according to Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentiment</a> creator Josh Sawyer. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/pentiment-and-fallout-new-vegas-designer-josh-sawyer-isnt-usually-a-fan-of-rpg-romances-but-thinks-cyberpunk-2077-nailed-it-if-i-were-gonna-base-romances-on-anything-id-probably-do-something-like-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to PC Gamer</a>, Obsidian's Game Designer noted that the romances are well separated from everything else in Cyberpunk 2077, unlike in other RPGs, where the romantic conversations happen in the party's camp with everyone nearby.</p>
<p><em>The reason is because those relationships, whether you like the characters or not⁠—which I feel is kind of beside the point, from a design perspective⁠—it's not in a party context. [In other RPGs] there are six of us together, and we're engaging in these romantic talks right next to everyone, and it feels kind of odd.</em></p>
<p><em>[In Cyberpunk 2077] You do something with Judy, let's say, and then, you wrap it up, you have a convo, and then she's like, 'I gotta go do some things, bye. She is gone, and you're not going to hear from her until time has elapsed, and probably until you've progressed the critical path. There's a built-in pacing, so the development of the human component of that relationship is developed over content that is specifically made for the two of you, like it's content for you and Judy alone. River doesn't come into it at all. It's not to say that's flawless, but I really do enjoy that way of doing them. If I were gonna base romances on anything, I'd probably do something like that.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of it is production value, which, of course, Obsidian is not necessarily the big cutscene company. Larian does that extremely well. Of course, CDPR does that exceptionally well. BioWare also does it well.</em></p>
<p>Do you agree with Sawyer's praise of Cyberpunk 2077 romances? And what do you think about RPG romances as a whole? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<section><p>Call me, Rhem.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Prior to attending <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/day-of-the-devs-summer-game-fest-edition-2025-everything-revealed/2900-6641/" data-ref-id="2900-6641">Summer Game Fest</a>, I had heard exceedingly little about Heart Machine's upcoming title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>. Admittedly, this might be because I was a bit tapped out; for as big of a fan I was of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, the studio's newer releases--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/solar-ash-review-ash-wins-day/1900-6417797/" data-ref-id="1900-6417797">Solar Ash</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-update-brings-a-more-traditional-roguelike-experience/1100-6531151/" data-ref-id="1100-6531151">Hyper Light Breaker</a>--didn't capture me the same way Drifter's lush-yet-somber world did. It seemed to me that Heart Machine was building upon the parts of their legacy that I found less compelling, emphasizing fast, fluid traversal and breadth in exploration rather than depth. Don't get me wrong--I <em>liked </em>both Solar Ash and Hyper Light Breaker, but they didn't captivate me--and their trajectory made me unsure if a new Heart Machine title ever would. Fortunately, a brush with Possessor(s) has proven me <em>very </em>wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">Billed as a search-action game--a more game-neutral term to describe the metroidvania genre--Possessor(s) marks a shift to the second dimension for Heart Machine and combines fast-paced, side-scrolling action (a la Metroid) with Dark Souls-inspired mechanics to create a tense, brutal, and gorgeous adventure game that emphasizes continuous discovery. Whereas the studio has previously shipped titles with more abstract stories and characters that aren't particularly humanoid in appearance, Possessor(s) also seems to mark a pivot towards a more traditional version of storytelling, with hand-drawn, swoon-worthy characters that dish out plot beats and dialogue with accompanying character art, similarly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275"></a><figcaption>Rhem speaks to Luca.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So far, this description contains <em>a lot</em> of comparisons to some incredibly beloved games, so I want to emphasize that despite this, in the section I played, I didn't find Possessor(s) to be overly derivative. Although it pulls inspiration from some of my favorite titles and I'd argue I didn't see anything that reinvents or refines its genres, its urban-horror setting, lustrous art direction, overall tone, and budding narrative feel both distinctly Heart Machine and like a new direction for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a world being overtaken by dimension-hoping demons, Possessor(s) kicks off with main character Luca watching one of her loved ones get ripped apart by a demon while pinned under a pile of debris. Eventually, she is able to move out from underneath it, only to find both her legs have been severed from her body. After a few moments spent crawling and crying out for help, she finds it in the shape of a tall, dark, and handsome individual named Rhem--who also just so happens to be one of the demons terrorizing humanity. Rhem tells Luca he can graft her new legs and save her life, so long as she enters a pact with him that will help save his life, too. She reluctantly agrees, and the two form a unique bond that ties both their souls to Luca's body.</p><p dir="ltr">As the two proceed, Rhem alludes to Luca not understanding the demons' motives or the true purpose of a global corporation associated with household appliances and creating better living for its customers. This ultimately sets up a mystery for Luca to unravel, causes all the game's evil, inanimate object enemies to make a whole lot more sense, and creates a path forward for her and Rhem's coexistence. Although not entirely novel--science-fiction and corrupt corporations tend to go hand-in-hand--it's still an interesting premise made more compelling by its macabre leanings, fantastic character art, and the overall atmosphere of the decaying urban sprawl I explored.</p><p dir="ltr">Most importantly, however, Possessor(s)' gameplay feels great. It's fluid, fun, delightfully difficult, and, based on the portion of the map I saw, seems like it will offer up a large, dense world ripe for exploration. Though some metroidvanias (or search-action games) leave room for hack-and-slash style gameplay, Possessor(s) requires a level of dexterity and intention that reflects the team's desire to incorporate souls-like elements into it. It also includes "bonfires" and a world that resets once you rest, further emphasizing that influence.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) has already impressed me, and with its promises of a complex narrative that allows you to play through multiple paths and meet a variety of characters with their own "heartbreaking" stories, it has quickly become one of my most anticipated releases of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has new details on<em> Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. This fifth entry in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified</em></a> board game series will feature iconic monsters, character classes, and puzzle mechanics from the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Preview</h2>

<p>&nbsp;As the name implies, <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will take players on an adventure through the Forgotten Realms. On this journey, players will take on at least two of four monsters drawn from the fantasy TTRPG's fifty years of lore.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horrified-dungeons-dragons-game-board.jpg?itok=oss3yY3U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horrified-dungeons-dragons-game-board.jpg?itok=cIs7CUzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those four monsters are the stuff of both legends and total party wipes. The Mimic, the killer treasure chest that feeds on foolish or greedy treasure hunters. The (non-<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Potato Head</a>) Beholder, the multi-eyed bringer of death and doom. The Displacer Beast, the ferocious feline with the power to cast illusions. Lastly, there is the Red Dragon, the most prideful and destructive of the chromatic dragons.</p>

<p>You can't just fight the monsters in <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Each one has a puzzle that must be solved before you can test your mettle against them. For example, the Red Dragon's puzzle involves finding its prized Orb of Dragonkind and luring it to its hoard.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> influences don't stop at the monsters. Each player can choose to play as one of five heroes: the Wizard, Rogue, Fighter, Cleric, or Bard. Each hero has their own unique set of abilities that can aid the group in their journey. Those special abilities are determined by rolling the most iconic of TTRPG dice: the d20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“With the assets provided by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, we got to see and read through the expansiveness of the worldbuilding; in many ways, our biggest challenge was deciding what we wanted to show,” said Sam Dawson, Art Director at Ravensburger. “Then, of course, we had to decide how to interpret that for the board and fill in the seams where no definitive visual exists.&nbsp; I think the result will both feel like familiar territory to fans alongside some new interpretations of the Undermountain they know and love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in how <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> plays, there is an opportunity to see it in action. The game will be featured in the latest episode of Critical Role's "Everything is Content" show, which will debut on Twitch on June 24th at 10 PM ET.</p>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will launch worldwide on August 1.</p>

Ultimate </em>and then taking a break from game directing to moonlight as a YouTuber and educate fans about game design, Masahiro Sakurai recently revealed he’s returned to development to work on <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>for Switch 2. But this past weekend, a comment Sakurai made about companies using AI in production drew harsh criticism. According to some experts, the mini-outrage was spurred on by a poor AI translation of what  Sakurai actually said, and shows the pitfalls of a  media ecosystem that increasingly relies on machine translation to understand a global medium. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196626,195697" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Director Masahiro Sakurai says large scale game development is becoming too time consuming and unsustainable,” read a now-deleted summary of an interview Sakurai gave to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ITmedia Business Online</em></a></span>, a summary that rapidly spread on websites and subreddits over the weekend. “He believes Generative AI is an option to improve work efficiency.”</p><p>The summary relied on machine translation of what Sakurai had said, an increasingly common practice on social media where information sources for companies, many of which reside in Japan, are frequently in other languages (indeed X, formerly known as Twitter, has a translation tool directly built in, while places like Bluesky link out to Google’s tools). Amid growing criticisms that generative AI initiatives are just over-hyped plagiarism machines, many instantly lamented Sakurai’s apparent take. Et tu,<em> Smash</em> daddy?

On the other hand, the market for indie games made by solo and small groups is also growing. How do you see the future of the gaming market? </p><p><strong> Sakurai:</strong> To be honest, nobody knows what the future holds [TN: he used the proverb ‘The inch ahead is darkness’ which should mean that]. I think when we want to make a large-scale game like it is in the present day, it’d take so much labor that we’d go into a situation where it’s not sustainable. I feel like we cannot keep going on like this, but at this point, the one effective solution that comes to my mind would be something like Generative AI. I feel like we’ve come to a phase where we must change the schemes, for example by utilizing Generative AI to improve work efficiency. And we might enter an era where only companies that could deal well with those changes would survive.</p></blockquote><p>Rather than Sakurai talking about what needs to be done or what he plans to do right now, the snippet about AI is situated in a series of hypotheticals about the future. While it’s notable that he’s not asked about AI directly, and instead brings it up himself voluntarily, it’s also one small throwaway thought in a longer interview that touches on a bunch of other topics. Plus we don’t even know specifically which tools Sakurai is think of here. Procedural generation and other techniques already prevalent in large games like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>? Or actually using generative AI to make <em>Smash Bros.</em> character art and rig up animations for different costumes? </p><p>A good interviewer might follow up on these points but the subtle context clues that indicate the difference between wary warning and enthusiastic endorsement aren’t likely to come through in rough and dirty machine translations. “It’s the sort of nuance that a machine translator would have trouble picking up on because it means filling in blanks that it will never realize are there,” James told <em>Kotaku</em>. “So much of Japanese as a language, as you might be aware, operates by implication and shared assumptions between two people and with this wording in particular that Sakurai uses, no machine translation is going to reasonably pick up on what I’m talking about because the very context and tenor of the conversation itself informs how certain words and grammar are parsed in the Japanese.”<br></p><p>Fighting to preserve that nuance might be a losing game, especially online where so many conversations get flattened into familiar tropes and binaries to begin with. Though many threads and  stories that originally shared the incomplete machine translation of Sakurai’s comments <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have since been locked</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1lhsyd8/super_smash_bros_director_masahiro_sakurai_says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1lhsyd8/super_smash_bros_director_masahiro_sakurai_says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/22/sakurai-sees-ai-as-a-potential-solution-for-improving-development-efficiency-as-costs-soar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/22/sakurai-sees-ai-as-a-potential-solution-for-improving-development-efficiency-as-costs-soar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or updated</a></span>, a less famous and popular developer probably wouldn’t get that level of follow-up and benefit of the doubt. Not to mention that there are still perfectly defensible reasons for being critical of Sakurai appearing to legitimize generative AI at all. </p><p>James argues that’s a difference between the American and Japanese contexts around AI and game development that goes deeper than translation mistakes. “AI discourse in Japan online is generally pretty far behind the west and criticism, while growing, mostly comes from outspoken individuals,” he wrote. “There is a lot of forced hype surrounding AI when it comes to advertising like in the west and certainly there are boneheads who actively shill for it, including in games. But overall at a social level, I would say it has yet to be subjected to the same level of rigor outside savvy creatives as abroad.”</p><p>The debate over what Sakurai actually said and meant is also a symptom of a growing problem in Western games media as sites lose sources and industry churn pushes out veteran staff (<em>Kotaku</em> once had three fluent Japanese speakers on staff at the same time). “Overall I do think it’s really concerning to see people recently trusting machine translators more than actual humans who have learned the languages,” Stenbuck told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Like, I do admit that the accuracy of machine translators has increased so much compared to the previous years, but there are still some phrases that are liable to be misinterpreted unless the translators know the exact context surrounding the statements.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ai-translation-of-smash-bros-directors-comments-about-1851784945]]></content:encoded>

That said, the same could be said of Poison Ivy's appearance in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which definitely was part of the Arkham-verse. And, of course, WB Games Montreal did make Batman Arkham Origins, a prequel that is considered canon to Rocksteady's core trilogy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New concept art from WB Games Montréal's cancelled 2015 Damian Wayne game "Project Sabbath" has surfaced, shared by character artist Rodrigue Pralier. The pieces clearly show Damian, an older Bruce, Killer Croc, and Huntress.

Back in 2021, another former WB Games Montreal developer posted images of Damian Wayne in his Batsuit — a sleek outfit with red Bat signal emblazoned on his chest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These designs also showed the same bearded older Bruce Wayne, although only inside his suit — meaning his newly-revealed face was obscured. Still, the designs suggest that, at some point, the older Bruce would still have suited up during his retirement. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Project Sabbath", a canceled Damian Wayne Batman game at WB Games Montreal, apparently has another wave of concept art revealed - this time by concept artist Goran Bukvic.

The game is also available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though Battlefront 2 doesn't support cross-play between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefront 2 has been steadily working its way up Steam's most-played games list since early May, when the game first began to climb from its usual player counts of around 1,000-1,500 in April to 5,000 concurrent players and beyond.

Those player counts then dipped back down below 10,000 in subsequent weeks, only to skyrocket once more in the past few days to even higher heights.</p><p dir="ltr">Where, exactly, the huge surge of interest in Battlefront 2 came from eight years after the game's launch is up for debate, but it looks to have begun around the time Andor season 2 concluded on Disney+. The show in large part focuses on the formation of the Rebel Alliance and its struggle against the Empire in the leadup to Rogue One and A New Hope. The show also prominently features the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as a key location--an iconic Star Wars setting that just so happens to be a playable map in Battlefront 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Renewed interest in the Star Wars shooter has translated into calls from Andor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actor Muhannad Ben Amor</a> and players for EA to make a Star Wars Battlefront 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>1 million copies sold<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>as part of an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546738448831087182">infographic</a> that includes several statistics about how the game's launch has gone for players. The sales milestone also makes it Funcom's fastest-selling game to date.</p>
<p>According to the infographic, 816,720 players have been swallowed up by Shai-Hulud while surveying 25,529,505 square kilometers of Arrakis and consuming more than 6,110,692,000 grams of spice.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but the Sleepers of Arrakis are likely happier to hear about the changes coming to the endgame, particularly those who would rather engage with the PvE gameplay in Dune: Awakening, and don't want to be bothered with PvP.</p>
<p>Joel Bylos, creative director of Dune: Awakening at Funcom, released a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">statement</a> to players today, beginning by saying, "<em>Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</em>"</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/app.bsky.feed.post/3lsbtlpe4cc27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidqbgaaa5jcymkui276dk4nsx2q676sgwze4j43pfsfgjrc5txqeq">
<p lang="en">The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about our plans:bit.ly/Dune_Awakeni...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc?ref_src=embed">Dune: Awakening (@duneawakening.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/post/3lsbtlpe4cc27?ref_src=embed">2025-06-23T14:54:25.908Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"<em>We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert - an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes.</em>"</p>
<p>Bylos goes on to describe how there have been many players complaining that their time with Dune: Awakening is ending prematurely, "<em>due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert</em>." So, beginning "<em>soon</em>," there will be areas of the Deep Desert that are flagged as&nbsp;<strong>Partial Warfare (PvE)</strong>, while the majority of the Deep Desert will still be flagged as&nbsp;<strong>War of Assassins</strong><strong> (PvP</strong><strong>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The new PvE areas of the Deep Desert will allow those solo, PvE-focused players to harvest endgame and T6 resources "<em>without the threat of conflict they may not want</em>."</p>
<p>Bylos still stipulates though that those solo players will still find it to be a grind if they go that route, as the game is "<em>balanced around guilds and groups</em>." He also clarifies that the PvP areas of the Deep Desert will still be where the best resources can be found, and that they will remain "<em>high reward, high risk areas</em>."</p>
<p>Other changes are coming to PvP play, specifically around scout ornithopters. In the next batch of changes, scout ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced, and rockets fired from scout ornithopters will generate more heat.</p>
<p>Scout ornithopters without rocket launchers and equipped with thrusters will have a max speed boost regardless of wings to ensure they remain the fastest ornithopters available, and a T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added "<em>to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat</em>."</p>
<p>There are also more changes coming to the Landsraad, as Bylos says the team is "<em>addressing some key flaws in the Landsraad design</em>," such as how stockpiling items is currently rewarded, despite that not being the studio's intention with how it wants the Landsraad to function.</p>
<p>Bylos ends his statement asking players to be patient as Funcom works to improve Dune: Awakening and build it in collaboration with players based on their feedback.</p>
<p>"<em>Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing. We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us - our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy</em>."</p>
<p>The reaction from players to everything Bylos talked about in his statement has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1limep2/never_change_reddit/">unsurprisingly mixed</a>. Some think he's taking the game in the entirely wrong direction, and rug-pulling Dune: Awakening into an entirely different game. Others are rejoicing for the changes, thankful that they'll be able to take part in more endgame activities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dune: Awakening hasn't even been out for a full month. It'll take time for it to evolve as the meta changes and <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/">new content is introduced</a>. And based on the fact that it has had an undeniably strong launch, it seems like Funcom is going to have the chance to evolve it for years to come.</p>

                <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 23, 2015. Below, we look at how it raised the bar for not only superhero games, but for the third act in video game trilogies.</i></p><p dir="ltr">There's an old adage that good things come in threes, and that's an idea that applies perfectly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. Rocksteady's final chapter in its Caped Crusader saga turned 10 years old this week, and it's still a masterpiece of superhero action that has stood the test of time. There's a lot to love about the game, from its dark storyline to its shocking twists--the Arkham Knight was a <em>red hood herring</em>--and more, but the lasting legacy of the game is that it solved the problem of video game trilogies a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s a familiar scenario: You fire up the third game in a beloved series, ready to be wowed. It’s good. You're having fun. But you can’t shake the feeling that you’ve done it all before. "More of the same" is a common criticism against video game trilogies' final chapters--but it's one Arkham Knight skillfully sidestepped.</p><p dir="ltr">If Arkham Asylum laid the foundation, then Arkham City was the stately Wayne Manor built atop it--bigger, bolder, and more refined. But by the time Arkham Knight came around, there were fears of fatigue. It followed the release of Batman: Arkham Origins in 2013 by Warner Bros. Montreal, which wasn't part of Rocksteady's trilogy but received considerably less acclaim. Could Rocksteady keep the momentum going?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It did--by pushing every idea of its Batman to the extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Arkham Knight is a finely tuned power fantasy built on three pillars: detective work, stealth, and bone-crunching combat. One moment you’re reconstructing crime scenes with high-tech forensic tools; the next, you’re a silent predator stalking armed militia; and then you're diving into balletic brawls that stitch gadgets and combos into a brutal symphony of chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">At this stage, Rocksteady trusted players to know how to be Batman. And in return, it gave them the tools to break past the limits of earlier games. Combat flowed with graceful brutality as you weaved through enemies using freeze grenades, shock rounds, and precision counters. In stealth segments, the fear mechanic hit new highs, as nothing quite matched the rush of trapping a squad of militants with a smoke bomb cloud and then quickly eliminating them one by one using new gameplay mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">But the game didn't just empower players--it challenged them. With the Arkham Knight and his private army escalating the threat level, players had to evolve. Rocksteady walked the razor’s edge between power fantasy and overpower fantasy, and never lost its balance along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then there was the Batmobile. What if Batman were a car? That’s the question Rocksteady answered by transforming Gotham’s most iconic vehicle into a game-changing mechanic. Not just a way to move across the city, the Batmobile became an extension of the Dark Knight himself--solving puzzles, charging into battles, and even taking on tanks. There's something surreal and satisfying about sneaking up on Deathstroke’s armored convoy in a 1,200bhp crime-fighting machine that could somehow still meet strict European noise-pollution requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Batman: Arkham Knight <em>is </em>more of the same, but pushed to its absolute extreme. It's a fitting finale to the Arkhamverse--especially if you choose to ignore Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League--and a celebration of Batman that still shines a decade later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to grab the game and celebrate its anniversary, then now is a great time to do so. The Arkham Knight Premium Edition regularly sells for an absurdly low price--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=10+Years+Ago%2C+Batman%3A+Arkham+Knight+Solved+The+Video+Game+Trilogy+Problem&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A18&amp;fnarticle_id=6532637&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Standard+Feature&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbatman_arkham_knight_premium_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F10-years-ago-batman-arkham-knight-solved-the-video-game-trilogy-problem%2F1100-6532637%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">GOG has a DRM-free version for just $6</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/">2025 Summer Sale</a>--and it's incredibly good value for money. Not only do you get the base game, but there’s a Batcave of DLC to dig into that ranges from challenge maps to standalone episodes focusing on Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've picked up a Switch 2, the game has also been substantially improved on the Nintendo platform as part of the Arkham Trilogy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE41LJyXh0"> According to Digital Foundry</a>, it's not entirely perfect, but it does run at a locked and mostly stable 30fps when compared to the sluggish performance on the original Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, Sega accidentally leaked sales figures for a number of its key franchises, revealing - among others - the sales of its open zone game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m. Meanwhile, as officially revealed by the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> sold 2.3m units.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an ‘oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>
