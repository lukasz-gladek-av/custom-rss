<figure><a title="game-key card survey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/57a37548ce9af/game-key-card-survey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has already been doing a little surveying and gathering of feedback, as we reported a few weeks back, with regards to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-is-seeking-player-feedback-on-game-key-cards-in-japan">physical and digital games, including how game-key cards are going down.</a> Spoiler alert: they aren't really going down very well at all.</p>
<p>Now, and as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Eurogamer</a>, the Big N is back at it, with a fresh survey for those interested to get busy filling in. Indeed, you can <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM?key=f2ff4cc19b9b3818&amp;cid=BAPSurveys&amp;eid=BAPSurvey0730_0127&amp;crmid=095575FC-0293-4888-8F7A-DD6D22045DA4">click right here</a> to go do just that.</p>
<p>This latest survey asks a whole bunch of questions related to how you feel about purchasing digital and physical media in various ways.</p>
<p>As you can see from our screens, they mostly want to know how strongly you feel about the physical game card actually having the game, whether or not you care about that, and how whether being in a store or buying online affects your thinking. Stuff like that, mate.</p>
<p>It all points to the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/furukawas-defence-of-game-key-cards-aint-all-that-convincing">Nintendo know people don't really care for the game-key card situation.</a></p>

<p>Anyhow. This survey is a good chance, whatever your thoughts, to get stuck into letting them be known loud and clear. So, make sure to get clicking on those multiple choice answers (it took us about four minutes to complete, for what it's worth).</p>
<p>Of course, despite multiple complaints from Switch 2 owners, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">developers have been praising Game-Key Cards</a>, so it seems unlikely they'll be going anywhere for a while now...</p>
<p>If you want some more thoughts about the physical, digital, and Gam-Key Card discussion, our lovely Zion made a video all about it following last week's Partner Showcase, so have a watch:</p>

<p><em>Have any strong opinions left about game-key cards at this point? Let us kn</em>ow in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8bitdo%E2%80%99s-first-wireless-xbox-controller-is-a-surprise-rare-collaboration.1261623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has created its first wireless Xbox controller in partnership with Rare, a game studio acquired by Microsoft. The officially licensed controller features a gold and blue design, with plenty of Easter eggs to celebrate Rare’s 40th anniversary.</p><p>The $89.99 8BitDo Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition (yes, that’s the product name!) can connect to an Xbox console via a 2.4GHz wireless connection or a USB-C cable. The wireless connection works through a small USB dongle and not Microsoft’s native Xbox Wireless protocol. You can also use Bluetooth to connect the controller to mobile devices.</p><p>This Rare special edition controller is essentially a wireless version of 8BitDo’s existing Ultimate three-mode controller. 8BitDo is using the same hall effect joysticks and Xbox-style impulse triggers, but there are also two swappable silicone joystick caps included. One is a skull from <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and the other is a jigsaw puzzle piece that Rare fans will immediately recognize from <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. The tactile D-pad is made from zinc alloy and matches the controller’s gold aesthetic.</p><p>You’ll also be able to program three profiles on this controller, which includes configuring the two back buttons at the rear. All of the customization can be done using 8BitDo’s Ultimate software that lets you remap buttons, adjust the ranges and motor tensity of triggers, set vibration levels, and customize each stick for more precise control.</p><p>As this controller is wireless, it has a 1,000mAh battery inside, which 8BitDo suggests will deliver 20 hours of playtime. The rechargeable battery takes around 4 hours to fully charge, and there’s even an integrated charging dock included in the box that automatically reconnects the controller once you remove it from the dock.</p><p>It’s surprising to see Rare, an Xbox game studio, turn to 8BitDo to create a 40th anniversary controller instead of Microsoft just creating its own. The collaboration comes as Microsoft’s own custom Xbox Design Lab controller has been on hold for months now. You can still design custom controllers, but Microsoft hasn’t been accepting purchases since last December — with no sign of when Xbox Design Lab will return.</p><p>8BitDo’s Rare 40th anniversary Xbox controller goes on sale today, priced at $89.99.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios—a team made up of four EA-owned studios—are focused on making sure the upcoming military shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> is extremely well-optimized, with the developers claiming the game will run on all consoles and platforms at 60FPS or more.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">EA revealed <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer in a big event in Los Angeles</a>. A large group of journalists (myself included) and content creators were invited there and got to play over four hours of <em>BF6</em>. The game reminds me a lot of <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>Battlefield 4,</em> and that’s not by accident. The team of studios working on the FPS is specifically trying to create a new <em>Battlefield</em> game that harkens back to those more grounded and contemporary military shooters that were both fan favorites. From what I’ve played so far, they’ve nailed it. And another thing that I can confirm EA and Battlefield Studios have nailed is the game’s performance, which ran perfectly during my preview. That’s not shocking considering how hard the devs are working to ensure<em> Battlefield 6</em> runs well on all platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106788/battlefield-6-on-ps5-60fps-fidelity-mode-90fps-performance-120fps-pro/index.html">As spotted by <em>TweakTown</em></a>, in a recent interview with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s principal game designer Florian Le Biha during the LA event, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2VK2fCG3HI?t=78">YouTuber Tech &amp; Co asked about the game’s&nbsp;performance and optimization</a> and Le Biha confirmed that it will run at a minimum of 60FPS on all consoles and PC.</p>

 <p>“Well, optimization for us has been one of the most important things for [<em>Battlefield 6</em>],” said Le Biha. “We want to make sure that it’s not just a game that looks graphically super beautiful, but it’s also a game that runs on all configurations, whether it’s on PC or on all Xbox or PS5 [consoles] of this generation. So we put a lot of effort into optimizing the game. We guarantee 60FPS on all experiences on consoles, [higher framerates] on PC, obviously, and even more on consoles [which support] performance mode, which allows you to go even higher.”</p> <p>As further reported by <em>TweakTown</em>, a player who says they are involved in <em>BF6</em>‘s extensive early access playtesting program, known as BFLabs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mesy9p/battlefield_6_pc_console_performance/">claims on Reddit</a> that the upcoming milsim targets 80FPS in performance mode on PlayStation 5 and also suggested that the PS5 Pro version of the game will hit 120FPS. They also explained that the Xbox Series S doesn’t have a performance mode, but still hits 60FPS, which lines up with what Le Biha told Tech &amp; Co.</p> <p>I can personally confirm that when I played <em>Battlefield 6</em> on PS5 at a party hosted by EA after the event, the game ran extremely well, looking like at least a stable and locked 60 FPS with no noticeable drops. On PC, when I played the game during the event, it ran at over 120FPS and felt buttery smooth. Of course, things could change when the game arrives in October or when people go hands-on later this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">during <em>BF6</em>‘s open beta.</a> But it does indeed seem like the devs are focused on making sure BF6 is super well-optimized on all platforms, even the Xbox Series S.</p>

It’s a contract that actually values the work QA does. I’m proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organizing works—and it’s worth it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven Software's QA union has had a long road to get here. The inciting incident for its unionization was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lays-off-at-least-a-dozen-raven-software-quality-assurance-contractors">a round of layoffs back in December of 2021</a> as a part of a studio restructure instituted by then-parent company Activision Blizzard. The following day, employees <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-walkout-activision-blizzard-solidarity">walked out to protest the cuts</a>, garnering the support of employees at other Activision Blizzard companies. Raven Software continued to strike for weeks before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-strike-fund-350000-management-finally-replies">the company finally responded in January</a>, only to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired">acquired by Microsoft</a> just over a week later. By the end of the month, Raven QA workers had announced the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-qa-employees-activision-blizzards-first-union">formation of Activision Blizzard's very first union</a>. While Activision Blizzard <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-qa-workers-strike-union">declined to recognize the union voluntarily</a>, the group <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-qa-workers-vote-unionize">won its union election the following May anyway</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, a number of other groups under Microsoft Xbox have unionized, both within Activision Blizzard and in other subsidiaries such as ZeniMax. This past May, QA workers at ZeniMax Media <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-fallout-doom-qa-workers-union-reaches-tentative-contract-with-microsoft-after-nearly-two-years">reached a contract agreement with the company</a>, while many others are still at the bargaining table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

A couple of stills were even shared by EVO2025’s official X account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A story in two parts.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evo2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Evo2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/eo2pkg2Psg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eo2pkg2Psg</a></p>— Evo (@Evo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Evo/status/1952120436810285238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The player in question is KojiKOG, an esports pro from Japan who mainly specializes in fighting games like Street Fighter, the King of Fighters and Guilty Gear. This weekend, he took on fellow Japanese player GO1 (Goichi) in the Winners' Semi Final for Fatal Fury: City of Wolves at the Evolution Championship Series 2025 (EVO2025).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although GO1 won both rounds (and went on to win overall), the fights were very close. Upon being defeated, KojiKOG clutched his head with his mouth open in a continuous scream worthy of… well, Edvard Munch’s painting The Scream. This dramatic emotional outburst, plus GO1’s bemusement, resulted in a number of meme-worthy shots.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I swear to God I’m not making fun of this dude but NO ONE HAS EVER LOOKED LIKE THEY SUFFERED LIKE THIS IN HUMAN HISTORY <a href="https://t.co/JekIbl1F0a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JekIbl1F0a</a></p>— kayos (@kayos_o) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayos_o/status/1952115459094143151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG eventually snaps out of his losing pose and can be seen chatting to GO1 and tidying up. It is clear from this that he was acting. However, shorter clips on social media have caused some who are unfamiliar with KojiKOG’s antics to worry that he was having a real breakdown. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The End of EVOgelion <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EVO2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EVO2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ht0vzmHXd3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ht0vzmHXd3</a></p>— Keith Ace (@Keith_Ace_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Keith_Ace_/status/1952151406544339104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG is known for being a bit of a comedian, often doing his screaming pose and pulling funny faces in interviews (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/82PbS1khSxY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like at EWC2025</a>). His dramatic reaction to losing this weekend was likely a reference to when he previously faced off against GO1 at EVO15. As seen in the video below, he did a similar screaming pose- puzzling the Japanese commentators as his antics weren’t well known back then.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>10 years ago, GO1 went to EVO for the first time and won 4 side games—Melty Blood, Dengeki Bunko, UNI, and AQUAPAZZA, beating KojiKOG in the finals</p><p>Today, they meet again on the EVO main stage, recreating the 'leg cutting incident' meme <a href="https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB</a> <a href="https://t.co/rfPVn2HJXg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rfPVn2HJXg</a></p></div>— HiFight(ハイファイト) (@HiFightTH) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFightTH/status/1952147416892981325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on this, legendary pro fighting game player Daigo Umehara mused that KojiKOG’s reaction was like a character in the SAW movies having their leg cut off.

                <p>Disney's big Fortnite project--whatever it might be--is still in the works and is said to be targeting a Fall 2026 release. That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-ai-hollywood-movies-5982a925?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj1WlG90hfrlndqPntMcR366Qqal9vfmaEL3j9hN4JnWUrH_70M8ucT_sHstYc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6890bed5&amp;gaa_sig=lpo4UvT40pOKiDH3Wi8wRCBs-Zfur_-2gFEdrybB-Tpi6kvRjmJq_Gl_8MLGnqOexWLZM29y1vwGyoqDMOTQkQ%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which also claimed some Epic executives have complained about Disney's reportedly slow sign-off and approval process. At the same time, the report said some Disney executives have expressed concerns about the project.</p><p>The report said Disney believes gaming can be a major revenue-driver for the company, which is why it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">invested $1.5 billion with Epic</a> to make a Disney universe inside Fortnite. Disney's Fortnite project is codenamed "Bulldog," the report said.</p><p>It remains to be seen exactly what Disney's plans are, but regarding the reported frustrations from Epic's side, the report said Disney requires sign-off from "so many different divisions."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Whatever the project turns out to be, the report said Disney parks and resorts boss Josh D'Amaro is personally leading the effort to get it done. The report said he's spent time with Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney near the company's HQ in North Carolina, and they have gone on hikes together.</p><p>The report added that "some Disney executives have raised concerns" about the project regarding "who owns fan creations based on Disney's characters." The publication said if a Fortnite player created their own mashup dance featuring Darth Vader and Spider-Man, that could lead to legal questions about ownership, among other things.</p><p>Disney and Epic have of course already worked together on Star Wars and Marvel crossovers, among others, but not all of them have gone over entirely smoothly. When Disney brought an Darth Vader to Fortnite featuring the AI-powered voice of James Earl Jones, people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">quickly made him say questionable things and curse.</a> This was corrected quickly, but it surely has not been forgotten.</p><p>The official word is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">Disney is working with Epic </a>to create "a place where you can play games, a place where you can be social, [and] a place where users can generate their own content." Essentially, D'Amaro said Disney's aim to create an entire "universe" where "all our stories can come to life."</p><p>"They can come to life in different forms, [like] games. They can come to life in ways that you can just interact with and play with the franchise in a way that's meaningful to you--a place where you can actually build," he said. "And we think that this is going to be a place where all fans can come and interact 365 days a year."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World." Along those lines, a Disney Imagineer recently teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">some kind of theme park integration for people who visit Disney's parks and play the upcoming game.</a></p><p>As for D'Amaro, he is said to be a leading choice to replace CEO Bob Iger after he plans to retire in 2026.</p><p>Fortnite is more of a platform than a single game that gets new updates constantly, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">soon-to-release Season 4</a>. In addition to the main battle royale game, Fortnite hosts games like Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Lego Fortnite, along with countless other user-created games and experiences on the platform. Whatever Epic and Disney might be cooking up could be just the latest game to exist on the Fortnite platform.</p><p>Disney no longer develops big games in-house, as its own Disney Interactive Studios shut down years ago. These days, Disney works with outside teams as part of licensing arrangements. Not all of the games are successful, though, as Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws failed to sell up to expectations</a>. One of Disney's latest major games was Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was developed by MachineGames in partnership with Lucasfilm. The game is <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">performing well, it seems.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last Friday's THQ Nordic showcase featured the reveal of Darksiders 4. The next entry in the long-running series finally pays off the ending of the 2010 original, uniting all four horsemen of the apocalypse in one game.</p><p>The teaser trailer shows War, Death, Fury, and Strife atop their mounts as they prepare to face the apocalyptic events that conclude the first game. For fans, seeing the story finally move forward is an exciting proposition as each sequel's plot has either run parallel to or taken place before the first Darksiders' narrative. Darksiders 4 is being developed by Gunfire Games, which previously made Darksiders III and is also known for its work on the Remnant franchise.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Although the trailer excludes gameplay footage, Darksiders 4 is described as a fast-paced third-person action game that blends traversal and puzzle-solving. Players will control their preferred Horsemen (how/if you can switch between them during the campaign is unclear), and the game will feature online co-op. Unfortunately, it's unknown how many players can ride together or how cooperative play will work in general.</p><p>Darksiders 4 doesn't have a release window, but it will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Workers at Raven Software, the Activision subsidiary known for its contribution to the Call of Duty series, have ratified their first union contract with Microsoft, three years after unionisation efforts began.</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within Raven Software started in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action protesting the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team. Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's anti-unionisation manoeuvres, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) has announced workers at Raven Software have "unanimously voted" to <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft">ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Xbox maker Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>The contract guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years, with "additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions".</p>
<p>In addition, the contract promises an "elimination" of crunch time. Seven days notice is now required for any mandatory overtime, and there is to be no "excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks" and "no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>Job descriptions will also become defined with this contract in place, while the promotions process will be made more clear.</p>
<p>"After more than three years of organising and bargaining, seeing it finally pay off feels incredible," Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven Software and member of the bargaining committee, said today. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need - better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It's a contract that actually values the work QA does. I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organising works - and it's worth it."</p>
<p>"Going from organising to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there," added Autumn Prazuch, another QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future."</p>
<p>CWA District 4 Vice President Linda L. Hinton called the contract between CWA members and Microsoft "proof that when video game workers organise, they can win lasting changes in the workplace".</p>
<p>Said Hinton: "By reaching an agreement with Microsoft that puts limits on excessive sustained overtime, also known as crunch, these members are tackling one of the most exploitative practices in the industry and setting new standards for quality assurance testers and video game workers overall.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to welcome these members into the CWA District 4 family."</p>
<p>Today's news comes just a couple of months after workers at ZeniMax Media voted to ratify their first union contract with parent company Microsoft. In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cwa-negotiates-new-contract-for-zenimax-including-substantial-wage-increases-and-a-credits-policy-for-qa-staff">the two parties reached a tentative agreement</a>, following almost two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>As for Raven Software, it is currently working on the next Call of Duty entry - Black Ops 7 - with Treyarch. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers have promised this will be the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/raven-software-workers-celebrate-win-following-three-year-battle-for-microsoft-union-contract]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that its new retro-inspired metroidvania <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> will launch on the Switch next month on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Loosely based on the 2600 title <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from creator Warren Robinett, Adventure of Samsara looks pretty awesome and we're really digging the whole retro vibe. But to be honest, we're still struggling somewhat to see the connection to the 1980 original beyond a couple of dragons and whatnot.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, Adventure's visuals were so basic at the time, you could interpret the presentation in a number of different ways, so we're going to hold off on our final judgement until next month. To reiterate, it does look really cool; lots of neat little abilities to discover and boss characters to vanquish.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.<br>
<strong>- Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.<br>
<strong>- Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.<br>
<strong>- Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.<br>
<strong>- Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also cooking up a revival of <strong>Fatal Run</strong> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, a combat-focused racer due to launch on the Switch later this year. Digital Eclipse, a subsidiary of Atari, is working on the final touches to the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on Switch and Switch 2, which looks absolutely awesome.</p>

Techno-loving hollowtooth Blade has joined the playable cast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, but he's not what I find most interesting about the free-to-play shooter's latest update. Developers NetEase Games have introduced a new system of penalties for ragequitters, keyboard-away-frommers, and other craven scumbags who abandon a competitive mode match early on because the dishwasher's overflowing, or similar.

I find all this interesting simply because it's trying to automate Justice and determine a disconnecting player's good or bad faith, based on a bunch of dumb numbers. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541112753868243356?l=english">read about the update in full on Steam</a>, but here's a quick overview with fewer number tables and fewer intervening remarks about *squints* "Panther &amp; Wolverine's Sneaky Sounds".

If a player disconnects during match loading, the ban/pick phase, hero selection, or within the first 70 seconds of the match, the whole match will be deemed invalid, and the disconnecting player will receive a points penalty that scales with repeat offences.
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects after 70 seconds, and doesn't reconnect before the match ends, they'll be Naughty Stepped as follows: 1) If the match ends within 90 seconds of their disconnection, there's no points penalty 2) If their team loses 90-150 seconds after they disconnect, they get a points penalty and competitive matchmaking ban, which both scale with repeat offences, while other players on the losing team get ranked point compensation. 3) If the match ends over 150 seconds after they quit, they'll get a larger point penalty and comp matchmaking ban. 
</p>
<p>
If the player who quit does reconnect before the match ends, and their team wins, they won't be penalised. But if they reconnect and the team loses, they'll get a points penalty... but no competitive matchmaking ban. Fickle and winding are the conduits of karma.
</p>
<p>
Similar rules apply for players who are detected as being AFK in the first 70 seconds of a match. Softer wrist-slaps are being doled out to those who pull the plug early during quickmatch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The most severe punishments are reserved for those who both go AFK and disconnect early during competitive. Damned souls indeed. But what if, what if that player was only AFK because they had to go administer the kiss of life to a postman, after the latter keeled over while delivering a crateload of community service awards, and what if that player then quit the game because they had to google appropriate post-resuscitation care? How are you going to distinguish a virtuous soul like that from somebody who came back from the kitchen with a plate of pickles and decided they'd rather watch Grand Designs anyway?
</p>
<p>
I'd love to know what kind of audience or playtesting informs the time windows, here. Why is 70 seconds the cut-off point for distinguishing between a player who noped out because their house has caught fire, and a player who has yanked out the router in fury because they got sneakishly dog-piled by Wolverine and Panther?</p>
<p>I imagine one consideration is how long it takes players to reach certain objectives or chokepoints on average. Another consideration is possibly how long it takes them to charge their Ultimate abilities - heroes passively gain 12 points of Ultimate energy a second, with different Ultimates requiring different amounts of energy. Fiddly stuff. Anyway, you are welcome to disagree with me that all of this is more interesting than Blade.

              <p>Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to <em>The Sims 4</em>? Why is <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at <em>Kotaku</em> experiment with reviving our <a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/morning-checkpoint">old Morning Checkpoint roundup series</a> that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first <em>Call of Duty</em> developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go!</p> <h2><em>The Sims 5</em> wouldn’t be ‘player friendly’</h2> <p>That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">told <em>Variety</em></a> when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on <em>The Sims 4</em>, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a <em>Sims</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-ea-1851355482">with help from <em>Barbie</em>‘s Margot Robbie</a>. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p> <h2>One sequel we are getting is <em>Darksiders 4</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Darksiders 4 - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_Wx2qlbdOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> testers win second Microsoft gaming union contract</h2> <p>Quality assurance devs at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030">amid the 2021 workplace fallout,</a> but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at <em>Updater</em> <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">now reports</a> that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao.</p>

 <h2>Global warming will make it harder to play Switch 2 outside</h2> <p>Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/heat-records-broken-japan-heatwave-climate-change-5275641">continuing to blaze through temperature records</a>. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">posted</a>. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-climate-change-temperature-handheld-1849168252">back in 2022</a>. Everything is <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462">going great</a>, folks.</p> <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is getting a super, secret remaster</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlDkMLMoSg">celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-beginner-tips-upgrade-skirmish-1851744251"><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em></a>, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>3</em>, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games?</p> <h2>Fight censorship, get free games</h2> <p>Over 1 million people claimed the <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomToBuy bundle</a> from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1951999439024869715">the storefront reports</a>. It included <em>Postal 2</em>, <em>Agon</em>y, <em>Fetish Locator Week One</em>, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">due to payment processors</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> isn’t getting delayed</h2> <p>The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/">near the end of August</a>. A November release date is feeling more and more likely.</p> <h2>Happy 40th Birthday Rare</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614509">8bitdo</figcaption></figure> <p>Someone on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1mh6aho/new_wireless_8bitdo_xbox_controller_leaked_on/">found a leaked Amazon listing</a> for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">the 40th anniversary</a> of Rare, the studio best known for<em> Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, among other iconic classics.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><em>When </em>it will launch in this period still remains uncertain. Nintendo has been spacing out first-party releases for the Switch 2, starting with Mario Kart World as a Switch 2 launch game in June, Donkey Kong Bananza in July, Drag x Drive in August, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A is scheduled to arrive on October 15. If the pattern holds up, it's not unlikely that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond could arrive during the lucrative holiday season as a must-have Switch 2 game, considering that the console already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">has an install base of 6 million users and counting</a>.</p><p>This will bring a lengthy development cycle to a close for Nintendo, following the company's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restart development in 2019</a> after it failed to reach the standards that the company expected of it, under Bandai Namco. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/">The game was re-revealed in 2024</a>, and since then, we've seen a trickle of new gameplay showing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">off action and mouse controls</a>.</p>

"Like really - loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though."</p><p>Larian has been keeping its next project--codenamed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">"Excalibur</a>"--under wraps, but in January, the studio confirmed it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">giving its "full attention" to the game</a>. We also know that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 was originally in early access for almost three years before it officially launched on PC on August 3, 2023. The game was later released for PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, and went on to win Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, among many other awards and accolades, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot's Game Of The Year</a>.</p><p>The most recent update for Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses/1100-6530875/">Patch 8</a>, introduced 12 new subclasses, a photo mode, and cross-platform play for multiplayer. Unfortunately, Larian has confirmed it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-says-making-dlc-for-its-games-is-boring-for-larian/1100-6531125/" data-ref-id="1100-6531125">not interested in making any DLC</a>, despite the game's popularity.</p><p>"You want a happy player and happy business, but you also need to have a happy developer," Vincke said in an interview with GameSpot earlier this year. "What we're doing now makes developers way more happy. We had a huge hit, and people said 'DLC this' and 'DLC that,' and we said we'd make DLC, but then when we had a moment to think, we asked ourselves, 'what are we doing?'"</p>

The actual play show (and, now, multimedia franchise) began in 2015, and since then Mercer has led all three campaigns, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-subscription-beacon-twitch-youtube-1851469461"><span>which you can listen to</span></a><span> on the group’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole/podcasts"><span>YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Campaign IV, however, will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan, a frequent collaborator with the group and the dungeon master of another actual play series called </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>. Mulligan’s years of experience and familiarity with </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>make him one of the most well-suited candidates to take the reins of a new campaign. Fans erupted into thunderous applause when Mulligan was brought on stage during the group’s Indianapolis live show over the weekend, but this is still a big change, and the </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>community has feelings on the matter.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Critical Role Direct: Campaign 4 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEuwZbNde2s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Mulligan was broadly welcomed with open arms, but many </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span> fans noted they were sad to see Mercer step down from the GM role, even if he will be a part of the campaign as a player. Fans were also taken aback by the announcement that Campaign IV will take place in a new setting, rather than returning to Exandria, the setting in which the first three campaigns took place. While diehards are mourning a fantasy setting they’ve been invested in for a decade along with Mercer’s shift out of the GM’s chair, this likely will make Campaign IV a better entry point for newcomers, as they won’t have to catch up on years of lore to jump in and watch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll watch, continue subscribing, etc. But would be lying if I didn't say it breaks my heart that Matt isn't GM'ing and some of the core cast isn't returning.</p> <p>If anyone could succeed Matt it's Brennan, but man.</p> <p>— Jolly Roger (@JollyRogX) <a href="https://twitter.com/JollyRogX/status/1951835783054360659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know I’m in the minority, but I’m not excited about the “new world.” Was really looking forward to how things would unfold on Exandria given how the last campaign ended.</p> <p>— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1951851585316720645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don’t know how I feel about this… Excited for a new story and world tho.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I have to admit, I’ve got mixed feelings when it comes to the Demon Slayer franchise. I’ve never really enjoyed Shonen battle series, save for the ones I grew up with, like Naruto and Bleach. I appreciate that Demon Slayer has become a similar entry-point for countless fledgling anime fans across the world, but as someone with no real passion for the series, seeing some of my favourite animation and game studios working in the mines pumping out content for it has me feeling jaded. I’m a massive fan of the CyberConnect2 developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/04/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-review/">Naruto Ninja Storm</a> series, but it’s an interesting feeling to play a game without also having a personal attachment to the source material. I don’t feel like Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is a bad experience at all, but I also don’t know if it’s an entirely necessary or groundbreaking one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 | Pre-Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvmW5nm11ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles closely adapted the anime up to the end of its Mugen Train arc, and this sequel sees you playing through a lengthy, detailed rendition of the Red Light District and the Hashira Training arc. I’ve known the names of these arcs but very little about their content – a prologue mode is available in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 that catches you up on the events of the first game if needed, but they do so by rushing you through just six incredibly brief battles. The proper story mode, thankfully, is much more dense in detail and even activities.</p>


<p>On the label, this is another anime arena fighter. The fundamentals here haven’t changed much compared to the last game – your standard attacks are on one button, while your specials are on the other. You’ve got a meter to build up that will either let you call in an assist from your second character, swap them in entirely, have them snatch you away from an incoming attack, or bust out your current character’s ultimate attacks. It’s basic, but it’s fun, and with a beefy roster of nearly 40 characters I was pleasantly surprised by how much variety there was to each demon and demon slayer’s movesets.</p>


<p>You do so much more than just standard arena battles in the story mode, though. Your enemies aren’t always just CPU controlled versions of the playable cast, but can be unique demon beasts that only show up for the story mode, incredibly detailed multi-phase boss battles, or even hordes of enemies you tackle all at once musou-style. In-between those battles, you’ve got varied environments to explore, like quiet forest paths or the bustling Red Light district. There are side-quests to discover, rhythm mini-games to participate in, and you’ll even frequently be busting out the special abilities of your playable heroes to track down clues and hints for your next objective. I was so impressed by how much fun it was to just exist in these spaces and explore them between the main battles of the story.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel like the story mode in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 was glossing over things or skipping around. There are so many cutscenes, presenting a mix of quiet moments, silly moments, and tense hot-blooded encounters. The boss fights are full of immaculate detail, special animations, and jaw-dropping cutscenes too. This is all a staple of CyberConnect2 anime fighters, yet experiencing them in this game leaves me with a weird feeling. For the Naruto series, it felt groundbreaking to see the iconic battles of that series re-imagined with sharp 3D models, fluid animations, and massively upgraded choreography.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer is already known for being a visual feast, though – it’s the anime with arguably the most budget and most visual flashiness ever put to screen. This game perfectly matches the art style, tone, and sensory overload of those animated moments, but because of that, these flashy boss battles and anime-accurate cutscenes aren’t a massive upgrade or shocking new approach to what they’re adapting. In some cases, the anime even handles these flashy fights a bit better.</p>
<p>What the anime doesn’t have, though, is a roguelike mode. When you’re done diving through the main The Hinokami Chronicles 2, the Hashira Training mode lets you dig into randomised battles as you follow a path to victory. It isn’t nearly as varied of a mode as something like Balatro or Slay The Spire, though. Your upgrades are pretty simple and your goal is just to reach the Hashira that you’re training with to beat them so you can earn a bunch of points to use in the gallery mode. Still, it’s a pretty fun alternative to a standard Arcade mode and adds an extra layer of engagement that kept me interested in sticking with the game just a bit longer.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is an incredibly solid game. It isn’t something that has converted me into being a fan of the series, though. I also don’t think the story content contained in it does anything groundbreaking or surprisingly different compared to the source material. An existing fan of the franchise will eat this up, but you shouldn’t try to use this game as the gateway to get your friends invested in the franchise.</p>

Developed by the Brazilian studio Ilex Games, players take control of the Solar Champion, a long-dead Plutonian resurrected by the primordial light of the Sun. Tasked with reactivating a mysterious interdimensional fortress, the Champion must restore balance to the multiverse.</p><p>As players battle through a series of diverse, interconnected biomes and confront brutal mutant bosses, they will unlock new abilities and enhancements—each revealing deeper layers of the game’s enigmatic, cosmic narrative. The game lives in the spiritual landscape of the original <em>Adventure</em>, brimming with its core elements of exploration, curiosity, and hidden secrets. Not a remake or sequel, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> instead asks players to search for subtle references to the very first adventure game as they journey through a remarkably deep world.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The game introduced players to a colorful cast of characters who embarked on an adventure to uncover the secrets of their island. The DX version of the title will introduce new playable characters including Agatha, Kilo and Romy. Players will also be able to discover events happening in parallel with the main storyline, such as the encounter of Kilo and Bos in the Underworld, and other events that took place between <em>Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout DX</em> and <em>Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy DX</em>.</p><p>Released in 2021, the second title in the <em>Secret</em> series takes place three years after the events of the first title.

In <em>Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends &amp; the Secret Fairy DX</em>, players will be able to play as Empel and Lila, while discovering a new episode in which the two companions meet Ryza at the capital to help her in her journey as she explores a new map.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_982122"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key DX</em> completes the <em>Secret</em> series and takes players one year after the events depicted in <em>Atelier Ryza 2</em>. Players will follow Ryza and her friends on their final summer adventure as they attempt to save their island and discover the secret of the “Code of the Universe.” In addition to reuniting with beloved characters from previous episodes and meeting new companions, players will also be able to play as new characters from <em>Atelier Ryza</em> and <em>Atelier Ryza 2</em>, such as Clifford, Serri, and Kilo. The DX version will introduce a new side story following Clifford and Serri after their separation from Ryza. The two will team up and embark on a journey to help each other achieve their own goals. Fans will also discover a new event that delves deeper into the relationship between Kilo and Bos, as well as explore a new island and its mysterious ruins.</p><p>Lastly, all games will include quality-of-life improvements and new features to enrich players’ experience, such as the addition of a “Custom Combat” mode in which they will be able to choose the level and combination of monsters they want to face.

            <p>As Rare - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Banjo-Kazooie and  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online.</p>
<p>The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mh6981/new_wireless_8bitdo_controller_leaked_on_amazon/">reddit</a>). </p>
<p>The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ">Amazon listing</a>, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller.</p>

<p>"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life."</p>
<p>Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below.</p>
<p>Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment.</p>

<p>"From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">it wrote</a>, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below).</p>

<p>Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox</a>. Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and many more games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">had left the studio after more than 35 years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced two major&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>projects as part of the celebrations for the series' 25th anniversary, and if you're a fan of old-school entries in the series, it looks like you're in luck.</p>

<p>First up, as revealed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2384580/view/527601954987180354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, a "large-scale" DLC expansion is in development for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>. Koei Tecmo is remaining relatively tight-lipped about what that DLC pack might entail, but it's a "major" expansion, according to an accompanying trailer.</p>

<p>Not only is the DLC coming, but a remastered version of one of the series' past entries is also in the works. Again, we don't know which game is up for the remaster treatment, but given that titles like&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>5&nbsp;</em>are fan favorites, it's likely one of these is the subject of Koei Tecmo's nostalgic attentions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=wuy-U073 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=LyZitU7B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is getting new DLC soon.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>' upcoming DLC comes a few months after Koei Tecmo revealed that the latest game in the large-scale hack-and-slash franchise has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">hit a million sales worldwide</a>. Since that announcement was back in February, it's likely the game has picked up even more sales for itself in the interim.</p>

<p><em>Origins&nbsp;</em>revolves around a "nameless hero in the Three Kingdoms", who will experience the "magnificent and alluring" story of this historical period (albeit through the lens of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>' characteristic over-the-top action) as he hacks and slashes his way through legions of enemies.</p>

<p>The game offers a new spin on the usual blend of action and strategy that characterizes&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, as well as a fresh take on the narrative that the series has revolved around since its inception in 2000.</p>

<p>You can check out the <i>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</i>25th-anniversary trailer right here. It's pretty short, but it should spark a few memories if you've been with the series since the start.</p>




<p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dynasty-warriors-origins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-origins/9p5hjqnx53xj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>I was munching crisps while watching a showcase of upcoming games from THQ Nordic last week, letting the likes of a new Spongebob Squarepants game and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> wash over me like barely flavoured fizzy water, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fatekeeper">Fatekeeper</a> showed up. I straightened up, just a little. It is a fancy looking first-person RPG made with all the hyper detail and vivid lighting you might expect of a game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It is also conjuring a game worth conjuring: the heavy hitting fantasy brawlabout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a>. As I watched the below trailer, I became more and more cautiously hopeful. Looks slick, but where's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dark-messiah-might-magic">the kick</a>?</p>

<p>It's being made by Paraglacial, a small THQ-owned studio made up of a few former Spellforce developers. And it isn't the first game to try capture the magical bootfoolery of Dark Messiah. A fantasy sword swinger called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellraid">Hellraid</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hellraid-development-on-hold">cancelled by Techland</a> some years ago, and it was while discussing that piteous loss that the studio began to plot their own take on first-person sword-slamming.</p>
<p>"We thought that this is a type of game that you don't see that often," said creative director Raphael Lubke during the showcase. "You have these huge awesome open world titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but you barely ever see like dedicated, more linear story-driven games with this nice focus on the combat mechanics of melee in a first-person game."</p>

<p>That combat does look weighty from what we were shown during a demo. Your two-handed sword is wielded with hefty swings, sometimes donking crankily off enemy shields, sometimes piercing their necks and entering a bottled animation that ends in a swift decapitation. You can take dashing sidesteps and swig health vials. It reminds me of the movement in Chivalry II, if your opponents were snarling singleplayer orc-a-likes in opulent armour, rather than screeching multiplayer knights. </p>
<p>We also get some hints as to other more magical powers you'll use, aside from the windy push powers and object-hurling telekinesis you can see in the above trailer. "You might be able to freeze a lake, lure enemies onto it, and then melt the ice with the fireball, for example," said Lubke. </p>
<p>But for now the focus seems to be on getting some chunky hits in with that massive claymore. At one point in the playthrough, the player coated a sword with poison and we watched as the heavy bruiser he was fighting slowly succumbed to the toxins, eventually keeling over. I will admit, even without that pivotal bootheel, there were some very entertaining ragdoll physics, not to mention some lovely vanishing screams as sharp-toothed foes tumbled into the pits below.</p>

<p>And these were some sheer drops. Paraglacial, the studio, is located in the German Alps, and it's a locale that has partly inspired the high-altitude terrain of the game's fantasy landscape (if not the ornate temple architecture). </p>
<p>"I always said this dream of founding is team in an area where you normally don't see game development teams, like remote rural areas like we are in the Alps," said Lubke. "And we also wanted to transport our love for this environment into the game and create a game world where the landscape, the environment is a part of the story itself. It's one of the main actors of the game.</p>

<p>"It's not an open world game, the maps are designed in a not extremely open way, but they allow for a lot of different trajectories. [It's] not a straight line where you feel like you're playing on rails. Linear, for us, means control over the narrative and the density of the experience, but it doesn't mean forcing the player down a shallow path."</p>
<p>We get a few other glances of the bruiser's innards. An item screen that looks like a mash-up of the inventory management of Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, for example. And an easy-to-solve puzzle tomb that the developer says won't be quite so simple in the full game. But otherwise it's a short but enticing glimpse of some promising battering. Still, I want to see that conspicuously absent kick. After loving the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-chose-to-boot-its-melee-system-in-favor-of-that-excellent-kick">strong booting</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> enough to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3gvwJ1xcjs">an entire video conversation about it</a> with Colm (RPS in peace), I am yearning for another equally powerful pair of shoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fatekeeper-looks-like-a-spiritual-successor-to-dark-messiah-but-wheres-the-kick]]></content:encoded>
