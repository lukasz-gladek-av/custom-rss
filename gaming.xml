                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>'s main endgame activities, Nightmare dungeons, will be permanently changed come Season 9, as Blizzard looks to make them both more challenging and surprising going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a new <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215863/purge-the-sins-of-the-horadrim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, when Season 9 launches July 1, Nightmare dungeons will receive some major updates. Most notably, there will be a new activity within them called Horadric Strongrooms. Described as a "potent micro-dungeon," strongrooms will be found more frequently on higher Torment difficulties and can also be reliably found by using a Nightmare dungeon sigil that guarantees the appearance of a strongroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players are inside the dungeon, players can discover a portal that will take them to the strongroom. In a system somewhat similar to Diablo 4's Infernal Hordes activity, players will be able to select from a number of statues that add modifiers to the strongroom, increasing the challenge but also the rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W5UkhQVtMQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6W5UkhQVtMQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will then need to attune themselves with the strongroom by slaying enemies within the vicinity of Horadric Pillars within a time limit. Those who complete the attunement process will be transported to the micro-dungeon's final boss that when defeated will reward a Grand Horadric cache that scales its rewards based on the amount of attunement players earned. These caches will include Obducite as a reward, an endgame material needed to Masterwork weapons and armor. Completing the strongroom will also grant a buff that lasts for the remainder of the Nightmare dungeon, which a chance to receive more XP from monsters, increased reputation gains, increased Obducite drops, 25% more gold, or Horadric Phial drops (a seasonal item that is used to make Horadric Jewels).</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be another new way to experience Nightmare dungeons--Escalating Nightmares. This new endgame activity is a sequence of three Nightmare dungeons that see dungeon affixes stack from one to the next, with monster difficulty additionally increasing for each subsequent dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">To access an Escalating Nightmare, players will need to find Escalation Sigils from completing Horadric Strongrooms. In pre-Torment difficulties, completing all three dungeons will finish the Escalating Nightmare. However, those playing on Torment difficulties will instead be transported to a boss fight, where players will take on a new version of Astaroth from the Diablo 4 main campaign. Players will need to defeat both Astaroth and his steed, which will become separate bosses over the course of the fight. Defeating Astaroth's mount first will see it go into a resurrection state, after which it will rejoin the fight if players can't defeat Astaroth in time. Astaroth can also be modified by Nightmare dungeon affixes, making the boss fight even more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164"></a><figcaption>A look at everything coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Nightmare dungeons will receive new affixes. Each Nightmare sigil will sport both a positive and negative affix. New positive affixes include the guaranteed appearance of specific shrines, increased XP gains, the appearance of Treasure Goblins, a guaranteed strongroom, equipment rewards, and currency drops.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Nightmare dungeon changes will be permanent additions to Diablo 4, Season 9 will additionally introduce new seasonal mechanics for a limited-time. Players will be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">create and modify Horadric Spells</a> to compliment their builds, and can further augment them using new Horadric Jewels that can be slotted into amulets and rings.

                <p>A decade after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light/" data-ref-id="5000-182057">Dying Light</a> came out in 2015, developer Techland is revisiting the zombie game with a major new update to refresh the game's visuals and other elements--just don't call it a remaster.</p><p><a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The "Retouched" update</a>, as it's called, launches on June 26. This update is focused on "squeezing out even more" from Dying Light, the studio said. "It's not a complete overhaul or remaster," the developer clarified, adding that the team has found new ways to "squeeze more from the tech we already have."</p><p>"One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets--and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game," technical game director Grzegorz Świstowski said.</p><p>In the Retouched update, players can expect increased texture quality and upscaling for textures to help them look "sharper" and better overall.</p><p>Additionally, the "maximum level of detail range" in Dying Light has been increased from 260% to 340% in the view distance menu from the game's settings. The studio is also adding new "8K Ultra shadow quality" and improved lighting for many surfaces. Surfaces that might have previously looked "flat" should not "really pop out and get depth."</p><p>Check out some of the images in the gallery below to see the improvements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148" data-ratio="0.55555555555556" data-width="738" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148"></a><figcaption>The wood now looks more like wood.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520149,1300-4520150" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond visuals, Techland said composer Paweł Blaszczak came back to "give the soundtrack a complete remaster" with a unique twist.</p><p>"He even recreated that retro-tape sound by actually recording on tape! Talk about dedication. It’s authentic, nostalgic, and absolutely fantastic," Techland said, adding that the Retouched update will have new tracks and ambient sounds. Audio in combat has been "juiced up," too.</p><p>"Every swing, every crunch, every zombie takedown will sound more satisfying, more impactful. You'll feel those hits," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abQYwONaKgk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/abQYwONaKgk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This Retouched update was first hinted at in January, and Techland said it took so long to realize because of the manual effort required.</p><p>"I basically walked through the entire map, looking for assets to be improved. And all of those had to be changed manually by our artists," lead 3D artist Krzysztof Knefel said.</p><p>The Retouched update doesn't require players to invest in new PC hardware, however, as Techland said it was important to keep the system requirements the same. The Retouched update is also available on PS4 and Xbox One, requiring Techland to test the game "endlessly" to ensure "we didn't run out of memory" for those older consoles.</p><p>The Retouched patch launches June 26 and it's free for everyone across PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Retouched update promises improvements on all systems, Techland said, "the level of changes may vary by platform," but it didn't dig into specifics.</p><p>June 26 is also the date that CD Projekt Red planned to release Cyberpunk 2077's big new 2.3 update, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620">it's been delayed</a>. Techland and CD Projekt are two of Poland's biggest developers, and fans of their games no longer have to decide what to play first on June 26.</p><p>Dying Light was followed up by 2022's Dying Light 2. The next entry in the series is Dying Light: The Beast, which launches in August for console and PC.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, you're able to select one of four classes for your character, with another being available later on in the game. Your class determines the ability trees you have access to, your stats, and certain playstyles that mesh better with specific classes. While you can make any class into what you want, it's most beneficial to choose a class that you can scale properly and efficiently as you advance in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>There are some classes that are best for beginners, but these classes won't benefit most players in the long run. If you're just looking for the best overall classes in Dune: Awakening, then you can check out the guide below to see a full class tier list and explanations for why each class is ranked where it is.</p><h2>Dune: Awakening class tier list</h2><p>One of the most important aspects of the class system to remember is that you're not locked to your class's ability trees for the entire game. You can eventually interact with "trainers" in Dune: Awakening that allow you to unlock other classes' ability trees, giving you the chance to create a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-best-starting-class-and-build/1100-6532573/" data-ref-id="1100-6532573">build </a>entirely or add some abilities you previously didn't have access to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517702" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517702"></a><figcaption>Selecting a starting class in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517702-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.07.30.88.png"></figure><p>However, not all trainers are accessible at the same time in Dune: Awakening. You can find some trainers early on in your journey, while others can't be found until much later. So, if you're looking for the optimal class route, you want to select a class that has a late-game trainer unlock, as this gives you that class's ability trees right away.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't always apply when it comes to picking a class, as one or two classes in Dune: Awakening are strong enough on their own that they don't necessarily need abilities from other trees.</p><p>With all of that in mind, here's our current class tier list for Dune: Awakening:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Tier</th><th scope="col">Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Mentat, Planetologist</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Trooper</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Naturally, there is quite a lot of room for debate with this tier list, as the classes in Dune: Awakening are all varied and can appeal to different players. However, we have a few concrete reasons for our rankings, which we'll outline below.</p><h3>S Tier</h3><p>In S tier, we have Swordmaster and Bene Gesserit. Starting with Swordmaster, this is arguably the best class in all of Dune: Awakening, regardless of your skill level, experience, etc.</p><p>Swordmaster begins with the Knee Charge ability, which can absolutely shred through enemies at close range in the early game and maintains its value in the late game as well. Knee Charge makes going through camps and other enemy spots an absolute breeze, allowing you to save ammunition and healing items when they're most crucial to have.</p><p>As for Bene Gesserit, this is one class you'll want to use if you're an experienced survival player or you've gone through Dune: Awakening a time or two already. The Bene Gesserit begins with the Voice: Compel ability, and the class emphasizes a psychological approach to combat rather than a physical one. This can make the early game a bit challenging, as you need to utilize your wits and avoid relying on abilities for every situation. However, if you can master the Bene Gesserit class, it's incredibly powerful as you progress.</p><h3>A Tier</h3><p>Moving on to the A tier, we have selected Mentat and Planetologist. The Mentat class could make an argument for the S tier, while Planetologist is just an all-around solid class that's good, not great,t for the duration of Dune: Awakening.</p><p>Mentat begins with The Sentinel ability, which is a terrific way to fight enemies without your character having to do much. The ability places a turret down and allows you to deal damage and get out of sticky situations with ease. One of the more intriguing parts of the Mentat, though, is its access to poison damage, which scales particularly well with ranged weapons.</p><p>As for the Planetologist, this technically isn't a starting class, but it's still a class you can unlock as you approach the late game. The Planetologist is arguably the best late-game class, but it's only in A tier, seeing as you can't use it for a majority of your playthrough. The class excels at base building, resource management, and other survival aspects of the game. It's seen as a utility class that doesn't have a major focus on combat, but you'll still have loads of combat abilities to access in the late game in addition to your new abilities from the Planetologist's trees.</p><h3>B Tier</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517701"></a><figcaption>The opening ability tree for the Trooper in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4517701-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-13.44.48.82.png"></figure><p>Finally, in the B tier is the Trooper. This ranking is slightly unfair, as the Trooper is actually a highly enjoyable class with a ton of use, especially in the early game. The only reason we put it in B tier is because you can access the Trooper's trainer early on in Dune: Awakening, allowing you to access its ability trees. So, you can essentially get the best of both worlds if you select another class at the start.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Trooper has some of the best mobility out of any class in Dune: Awakening, primarily thanks to its starting Shigawire Claw ability that acts as a grappling hook. The Trooper also has some terrific early combat abilities, making it a solid beginner class as well as a decent class for all skill levels.</p><p>And that wraps up our class tier list for Dune: Awakening. Of course, as time goes on, developer Funcom might make some updates to the classes and even add new ones, so this tier list may change over time. </p>

                <p>In 2020, the ArcForged team of fan developers released Sonic Smackdown, a fighting game featuring several characters from Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. Now, ArcForged has returned with an upgraded version of that game, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown. And as seen in the announcement video below, it's clearly inspired by Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom games.</p><p>This project is not affiliated or endorsed by Sega itself. But it does look pretty polished for a fan-made creation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dn7uq5g6iM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4dn7uq5g6iM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Unlike its 1-vs-1 predecessor, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown has 3-vs-3 tag battles on tap. The roster isn't as deep as the 17 characters in the original Sonic Smackdown, but the primary characters are back including Sonic, Shadow, Knuckles, Mecha Sonic, and Doctor Eggman.</p><p>Players will be able to choose between having one, two, or three characters on their team, and the game has rollback netcode. Since this is an unofficial fan project, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown is available for free on <a href="https://arcforged.itch.io/ultimatesonicsmackdown" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ArcForged's itch.io site</a>.</p><p>The next official Sonic game from Sega, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, is an arcade racing title that's set to hit PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox, and PC on September 25.

                <p>Few games pack the technical punch of Cyberpunk 2077, making it an interesting proposition for Nintendo's shiny new handheld. While the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade to the original, Cyberpunk 2077 is considered one of the most hardware-intensive games in recent years. Despite this, CD Projekt Red's ambitious Switch 2 port is a commendable one that makes the most of the console's power, but with some noticeable drawbacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 for the Switch 2 offers a performance mode and quality mode for both docked and handheld play, with the key difference between the two play styles being resolution. While docked, Cyberpunk 2077's resolution ranges between 540p and 1080p. In quality mode, it shouldn't fall below 720p. Handheld play, depending on the graphics mode, scales between 360p and 810p. This sounds rough, but given the screen size and DLSS, Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty palatable on the Nintendo Switch 2. Post-processing effects help offset this low resolution and the Switch 2 screen boasts a clean image, especially at a standstill. The quality can vary depending on what's happening on screen, though. If you're speeding through Night City or in the heat of combat, the resolution may plummet, but most players probably won't be able to tell.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143"></a><figcaption>Johnny Silverhand looking at V with Night City in the background captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quality mode targets 30 frames per second and performance mode targets 40. The caveat is that performance mode while docked only works with 120Hz TVs and monitors, meaning that not every display can utilize the frame rate boost. However, in my testing, the frame rate boost seemed pretty negligible when compared to quality mode. This is largely due to the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 does not support variable refresh rate while docked, meaning the frame rate dips are noticeable. Fortunately, the quality setting appears to be more consistent. The frame rate can fluctuate depending on where you are in the world and what's happening. Thanks to the Switch 2's built-in VRR screen, performance mode feels pretty solid while playing handheld. That said, Dog Town--the new district added in the Phantom Liberty DLC--appears to be particularly taxing on the Switch 2. It's far from unplayable, but it does run slightly worse than other parts of the city. This shouldn't come as a surprise considering Phantom Liberty never made it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One due to technical limitations. That makes its inclusion on the Switch 2 all the more noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2, the visuals have noticeably been pared back. While it doesn't feel as extreme of a downgrade as The Witcher 3's 2019 Switch port, those who played Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-end PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5 will definitely see the difference. Draw distances are reined in, textures aren't as detailed, and the lighting isn't as crisp. That said, it does appear to outpace last-gen consoles--perhaps not in every way, but I'd much rather play Cyberpunk 2077 on my Switch 2 than my creaky old Xbox One. For me, the most notable differences are the smaller crowd sizes and emptier roads. At times, especially in the downtown areas, Night City feels a bit empty. Concessions had to be made, and I understand why this was chief among them, but wandering around a quiet city center can take me out of the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144"></a><figcaption>The hacking menu on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a straightforward port to the Nintendo Switch 2. CD Projekt Red has leveraged the console's hardware to add in some new ways to play. The most interesting of the bunch are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">mouse controls</a>. This lets you use a Joy-Con as a mouse in order to aim, and it works well. Once I tweaked the sensitivity, I had no trouble lining up headshots and gunning down enemies from afar. It's a little awkward maneuvering with mouse controls outside of combat, and the default button layout took some getting used to, but it feels like more than just a gimmick. I could see myself playing for dozens of hours with mouse controls turned on. However, the gyro controls <em>do</em> feel like a gimmick. Using a Pro Controller or Joy-Con, you can aim using motion; it's not quite as imprecise as it sounds, but it's certainly not the ideal way to play Cyberpunk 2077. The more approachable, middle ground is to use the gyro controls for subtle adjustments while aiming. You can control your camera with the right stick, but when you need to make a slight adjustment you can use the motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, CD Projekt Red has added touch controls to the experience. This primarily lets you navigate menus with your finger. As someone who has put in over 250 hours into Cyberpunk, navigating the menu with analog sticks is muscle memory at this point, so I've largely ignored this feature (I also don't like getting fingerprints on my screens). However, the touch screen controls are intuitive and could alleviate some of the inventory management issues that newer players might experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145"></a><figcaption>V holding a pistol outside of Night City captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quite possibly the coolest feature in the Switch 2 version is cross-progression, letting you transfer your saves between PC and console. This isn't new for Cyberpunk or CD Projekt Red, but it makes this package considerably more inviting. After I completed Phantom Liberty for the first time in 2023, I've been slowly chipping away at a 100% playthrough, and cross-progression makes that even more attainable. The Witcher 3 for Switch eventually got cross-play, but for that functionality to work on day one with Cyberpunk 2077 is commendable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've never played Cyberpunk 2077 and the Switch 2 is your only means to do so, then it's an easy recommendation. The base game is excellent and the Phantom Liberty expansion is phenomenal. However, if you've already played Cyberpunk 2077 and don't feel an itch to return to Night City, then this may not be worth your time. The Switch 2-specific features are a nice touch--and it's great to see CD Projekt Red embracing the hardware--but they don't elevate Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its already impressive pedestal.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-3-gets-first-trailer-and-autumn-release-date">unveiling</a> earlier this month drew some mixed responses; there was, for instance, ample excitement over the fact baby dinosaurs will finally be wandering all over the place come its arrival later this year, but less enthusiasm for Frontier Developments' decision to whip the theme park sim's scientist avatar art into existence using generative AI. But now, the studio has confirmed it's reversing course on the latter after "some initial feedback".
</p>
<p>
Word Frontier would be relying on generative AI to create its boffins first emerged via Jurassic World Evolution 3's Steam page, which, alongside the game's modest system requirements, included the AI disclosure statement - as mandated by Valve - that "Scientists' avatars" would be created using the controversial technology. This, seemingly, referred to the face portraits accompanying employable staff - rather than key characters - throughout the game.
</p>
<p>
Some fans have dismissed concerns around the use of generative AI by pointing out that scientist avatars are a fairly minor element of Jurassic World Evolution 3, and there've also been suggestions the game's 2021 predecessor made similar use of the technology - albeit before Steam's mandatory disclosure rule came into play. But the pushback among the community has been significant enough that Frontier has taken note and ditched its AI usage.

It shared the news on the game's Steam forum, but a longer statement was provided to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback">Game Watcher</a>. "We have removed the use of generative AI for scientists portraits in Jurassic World Evolution 3 following some initial feedback," Frontier wrote. "The team are continuing their diligent work on the game and are very much looking forward to launching on 21st October."
</p>
<p>
Frontier, of course, is far from the only developer to have dabbled with generative AI, and far from the only one to face criticism for doing so. Activision was accused of creating "AI slop" by Call of Duty fans after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated art was used in promotional material for the billion dollar franchise</a>, including a Santa zombie crafted with so little artistic regard, apparently nobody at Activision noticed it had six fingers. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">recently drew criticism</a> after releasing an AI generated playable (in the loosest sense of the word) demo "inspired" by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
For all the controversy, though, it's clear AI is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">changing game development forever</a>, and numerous companies, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-generative-ai-is-just-another-new-technology-to-be-tested">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Take-Two</a>, have discussed exploring generative AI "tools". Nintendo's Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">recently addressed the technology</a> too, acknowledging its potential to "enhance productivity", while adding, "There's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/691570/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-sees-death-stranding-2-as-a-cautionary-tale.1227255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For once, the unflappable Hideo Kojima was overwhelmed. Even close to four decades of game-making experience didn’t prepare him for his biggest tribulation so far: developing <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> during the covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>“I thought I can’t pull this off. [I can’t] meet people or scan people, or shoot with people. I almost gave up. And also the staff were all remote, and I became sick as well. I thought it was just the end of the world,” he says through an interpreter as part of a group interview in Sydney. “I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p><p>Even his initial scouting of Australia, where<em> Death Stranding 2</em> is predominantly set, had to be carried out remotely via Zoom, with Kojima painstakingly directing a local contact to document the landscape on his behalf. “Looking at it from a camera and to be there is totally different, so that’s disappointing.”</p><p>For Kojima, those experiences led to a different approach for the sequel. His own sense of isolation that arose from having to develop <em>Death Stranding 2</em> with a remote team saw him reconsidering its tale — yet it’s also this isolation that led to Kojima realizing the perils of digital connectivity.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>Kojima’s curiosity around Australia was eventually sated. As part of a promotional world tour for <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, he has made his way to Australia to chat about the game with film director and his personal hero, George Miller, at the Sydney Film Festival. So drawn is Kojima to the local sights that the noted cinephile says he hasn’t caught any movies at the festival. Instead, he spent the day at the zoo.</p><p>Kojima’s legacy as a game designer is anything but typical, from his earliest days as the creative force behind the much-acclaimed<em> Metal Gear</em> series to his less-than-amicable departure from Konami. And like <em>Metal Gear</em>’s anti-war narrative, tumultuous world events have shaped the <em>Death Stranding </em>series, the first game being conceptualized in the midst of a politically charged climate back in 2016. He points to key events such as Brexit and the first Donald Trump administration, with thoughts of creating a game that focused on bringing people together.</p><p>“[Back then] there was no theme in games about connections,” he explains. And a few months after <em>Death Stranding</em> was launched, the outbreak of covid soon upended everyday life, including Kojima’s. The isolation he felt almost mirrored the sense of solitude that’s so prevalent in the first <em>Death Stranding</em>. But at the same time, he seemed wary about the digital overload that came with having to stay online — to connect with one another — during the pandemic. </p><div><p>“I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p></div><p>“We had internet when we had this pandemic. It wasn’t like during the Spanish flu,” he says. “We could order things online, we could work online, we could connect via Zoom, or you could go to concerts; they do live concerts on the internet. So the society kind of changed to being very digital.” This digital dependence struck him as “not always very healthy,” which is compounded by the prevalence of surveillance technology, such as facial recognition, during the pandemic. The sum of these experiences inspired him to rewrite <em>Death Stranding 2</em> as a cautionary tale.</p><p>The contrast between the two titles’ messages lies in their logos. Kojima remarks that there’s a marked difference between the original <em>Death Stranding</em>’s logo and the sequel’s. Unlike in the original, the tendrils — or the “strands,” as he refers to these lines — are no longer emerging from the title, but are instead holding the name up in the sequel’s logo. “You see the strands coming to the logo. It’s almost like [<em>The</em>] <em>Godfather</em>,” he says, referring to the seminal 1972 crime film.</p><div><p><figcaption>The different logos for <em>Death Stranding</em> and its sequel.</figcaption></p></div><p>Seated at the front of a small conference room in the PlayStation office in Sydney, the 61-year-old Kojima appears more reticent since the previous <em>Death Stranding</em> world tour — perhaps a sign of weariness and prudence in the pandemic’s aftermath. When I attended the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-on-tour">Singapore leg of the tour</a> in 2020, Kojima shook hands with journalists and conducted individual interviews, while fans who attended the event were invited to take pictures with him. “It was an indirect connection to the game,” he said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/12/16/21019773/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-death-stranding-world-tour-machine-hideo-kojima">in an interview</a>. The promotional event was, in a way, an extension of <em>Death Stranding</em>’s themes of connectivity. </p><p>But for the second world tour, at least in Sydney, journalists were invited to a group interview, and there was no fan interaction beyond his appearance at the Sydney Film Festival when he waved to eager fans who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the game designer before the event. I was informed by the PlayStation PR team that Kojima didn’t want to risk getting ill again for the rest of the <em>Death Stranding 2</em> world tour. This feels understandable; Sydney is, after all, only the second stop, and perhaps his bout of illness during the pandemic was alarming enough that he prefers putting some physical distance between himself and the public.</p><p>Nonetheless, he is still in good spirits during the group interview, at one point even exclaiming that he is probably talking too much. “This is another reason why I’m doing this world tour. I couldn’t go out, travel, and meet people the past five years, so I thought it’s about time.” </p><p>Yet, at the heart of Kojima’s introspection is still a desire to connect with people, particularly his fans. Part of the reason he’s working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> is due to their desire to see another action-espionage game in the vein of <em>Metal Gear</em>. <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, meanwhile, has a greater focus on combat than the first, a feature that Kojima also partly attributed to <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-has-more-combat-thanks-to-metal-gear-fans/"><em>Metal Gear</em>’s popularity</a>. With more players familiar with <em>Death Stranding</em>’s idiosyncrasies as a “delivery game,” he’s ready to make the sequel a tad more approachable. In a way, it’s his way of bringing more people together through the <em>Death Stranding</em> series, which he refers to as “a game of connections.”</p><p>“I think we’re a little stronger,” Kojima says of the world after pandemic lockdowns. “If you could use that experience [of connecting with one another] from the game, I want you to maybe use that experience in real life. Not just in your <em>Death Stranding</em> world, but after you go outside, you feel something in your real world every day, and I want you to link what you felt playing the game as well.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/691570/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2]]></content:encoded>

So let’s go over how to use her deck to defeat Kefka (and your friends) once and for all. </p><h2 id="h149740"><a id="2"></a> Revival Trance deck basics</h2><p>The commander for this <em>FFVI </em>themed deck is “Terra, Herald of Hope.” She is a Red-, White- and Black-cost card with a Power and Life of three each. Her two abilities are “Trance” which lets you send the top two cards from your deck to the graveyard (called milling) and in return, Terra gains “Flying”, making her much more difficult to block. Her other ability allows her to pay two mana cost whenever she deals damage to an opponent to bring a creature with Power of three or less from the Graveyard onto the Battlefield. Thanks to the ease with which she can gain Flying, she should be able to slowly bring back her decimated team.</p><figure id="" data-id="5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-recommend-id="image://5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-format="png" data-width="679" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-recommend-id="image://5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-format="png" data-width="679" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, Terra was not the one who went searching for her friends in <em>FF6</em>, that was Celes, so of course she’s here too! “Celes, Rune Knight” allows you to discard any number of cards in your hand, and in return allows you to draw that many plus an additional card. This ability gives Terra ample fodder to scavenge the Graveyard to bring some powerful creatures onto the Battlefield which is even better given Celes’ secondary ability. Whenever a creature is brought from the Graveyard to the Battlefield, every creature you control gets a +1 counter to both Power and Life. Even better, this stacks so every turn not only do you increase the size of your army with Terra, but you then increase their strength with Celes.</p><h2 id="h149741"><a id=""></a> Expedite the Revival process using these cards </h2><p>Terra and Celes weren’t alone in their fight against Kefka, so there are plenty of other cards that can help restore the world from ruin. Here are a couple:</p><figure id="" data-id="2221f47bc650f1075935f5a042eea23f" data-recommend-id="image://2221f47bc650f1075935f5a042eea23f" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy card shows Cyan, the Vengeful Samurai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy card shows Cyan, the Vengeful Samurai." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2221f47bc650f1075935f5a042eea23f" data-recommend-id="image://2221f47bc650f1075935f5a042eea23f" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy card shows Cyan, the Vengeful Samurai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Cyan: Vengeful Samurai is not an easy card to get out given his high cost of 7 Mana, but this can easily be brought down as this number is decreased by one for every creature in the Graveyard. </strong>Try to use Terra and other cards like “Gogo: Mysterious Mine, which can become a copy of Terra to quickly get his cost down by adding creatures to the graveyard. Alternatively, since he has a Power of three, he is a candidate for Terra’s Revival. Once he is on the field, he will be incredibly lethal given he gets +1 to Power and Life for every creature that leaves the Graveyard—which we already established, you will do a lot of.</p><p><strong>“Rejoin the Fight” is another powerful tool to fill your side of the Battlefield. </strong>This card has you mill three cards, then forces all of your opponents (since this is the Commander format, there is usually more than one) to choose one creature from your Graveyard. Those creatures then come back to your side of the Battlefield.</p><p>While you’ll be bringing back plenty of cards from Graveyard with this deck, “Anger” is perhaps the only card that should stay there. “Anger” is a pretty weak card, but it has a cool ability that only triggers if it is in your Graveyard. As long as you have a Mountain (which you should), all creatures you control have Haste, letting you quickly put out damage from creatures played from your hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-recommend-id="image://d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-recommend-id="image://d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, if things start going really bad, just pull a Kefka and destroy the world using “Ruinous Ultimatum.” This card is incredibly high-cost but allows you to destroy all non-land permanents all your opponents control. Use it to help reset the board or pull even farther ahead.</p><hr><p>These are just a couple helpful cards in this pre-constructed deck, but there are plenty of other interesting and fun options that help you move creatures from your hand or deck to the Graveyard and then to the Battlefield. Keep experimenting and try out all kinds of other cool combos and plays, and you will restore the world from Ruin in no time.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-mtg-final-fantasy-6-terra-cyan-1851785011]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that its wheel chair basketball game Drag x Drive will release on August 14th for the Switch 2. The game will be a digital exclusive through the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop, ruling out a physical release for the game.

<p>Drag x Drive is a 3v3 multiplayer wheelchair basketball game, with players needing to use the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons’ mouse mode optical sensors along with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score. to really get the full experience.</p>

<p>In our Drag x Drive preview, Stefan said, <em>“The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see. Secondly, it’s all just a bit drab…With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could –&nbsp;could – be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.”</em></p>

		<p>Bloomberg is reporting that Microsoft is planning to layoff a significant number of people in the Xbox division next week, with the company restructuring the organisation. This seems to be separate from the announcement of last month when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/">Microsoft announced it was laying off 3% of all employees affecting thousands of jobs</a>.</p>
<p>This new round of layoffs is not supposed to be public knowledge according to Bloomberg, so the scale of these layoffs is not yet known. We do not know if it will lead to studios being shuttered or if it will be other roles in the division that will be affected. Microsoft has not shied away from making cuts with this being the fourth round of such cuts within 18 months. The last time the gaming side was hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks were closed by Microsoft.</a></p>


<p>Microsoft’s market value is currently at $3.646 trillion.</p>

<p>And it's cheaper than most</p>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/299d8a1b1cd6e/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier today, Nintendo dropped a surprise on everyone by revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s release date <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">on the Nintendo Today! app</a>. And now, a few hours later, pre-orders are open — and that means the price has been revealed, too.</p>
<p>You can snap up the digital-only wheelchair basketball game for just <strong>$19.99 USD / GBP £16.99</strong>, which is a pretty bargain price all things considered. Many didn't expect the game to retail at a high price given its premise, but it's good to have confirmation.</p>
<p>You can snap up those pre-orders on the eShop right now; here are links to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/drag-x-drive-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">the UK one</a>.</p>

<p>Described as "the next generation of 3-on-3 sports" by the Big N, Drag x Drive takes full advantage of the Joy-Con 2's Mouse controls. It's playable <em>only</em> with them, meaning you'll need to have the best coordination to become a master. At least, from our experience trying it out.</p>
<p>On 14th August, you'll be able to find out for yourself whether you're the king of the courts.</p>
<p><em>Let us know whether you'll be picking up Drag x Drive in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next big patch for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrives tomorrow, June 25, 2025, and the publisher has now detailed everything included. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we knew already, Title Update 1.0.6 includes the game's next story pack, which introduces a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-new-ally-character-and-if-you-watch-critical-role-they-may-sound-familiar">new Ally character for Naoe and Yasuke played by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond</a>. Players will meet Rufino, Daymond's character, and get to hang out with him at their hideout — though whether you can also romance him is unconfirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big addition that was previously announced is a new Nightmare Difficulty option. Today brings further detail on what this will comprise, with perfect parries required to deflect hits without taking any damage, fewer combat resources, plus smarter enemies able to see and hear Naoe's movement even while crouched or in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For a slightly more difficult challenge generally, Ubisoft has added an Open World Alarm system that extends the stomping grounds of Shadows' fearsome Guardian warriors outside of castles and enemy camps. Now, Naoe and Yasuke can earn Wanted status in the open world, should you repeatedly be naughty and attack civilians or military units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is set to continue adding small dollops of extra story missions, alongside other fixes and feature additions, through the rest of 2025, as fans await Shadow's first major expansion Claws of Awaji, due at some point before the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of additions, and a long rundown of the update's bug fixes, lie below in full.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">New Free Story Pack: "A Critical Encounter"</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Reward:</strong> New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li><strong>New Trophy/Achievement:</strong> "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.<ul data-cy="list"><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit - imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.<ul data-cy="list"><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries - only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">VFX Toggles</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more. All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Open World Alarm</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have expanded the Regional Alert System available in Castles to the whole Province. Now by repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Horse Camera Presets</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now toggle between 3 different camera presets while riding on your mount (hold the down button on controller/'X' key on keyboard while riding) allowing for a more cinematic experience to take in the full beauty of Japan.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Ultra Low Specs for PC</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>We are adding a new visual quality level, the Ultra Low mode. This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title1">LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the Onryo Mask remained visible despite selecting the option to hide gear.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to earn Mastery Points.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Mastery Points were not returned after resetting the Mastery Tree.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not switch characters anymore even without gameplay context restrictions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where allies could be trained to veteran rank without upgrading the dojo to level 3.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gennojo did not immediately appear in the hideout after recruitment. <em>He was busy washing his hair!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player remains stuck in a Red Zone, without being able to fast travel anywhere, by allowing them to fast travel to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Oni Drawing remains stuck on screen after completing the "Vision of the Realms" quest.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Quests</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "A Chance Encounter" quest when following Fuyu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the quest after defeating all Kabukimono.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lady Oichi's letter became unavailable after the Fuji-maru cutscene.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to talk to Katsuhime in the crop field when she was sitting on the ground. <em>She just wanted some peace and quiet!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where tracking the "Temple Stories" quest only showed a progress bar with no text.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Genzaburo's Teppo Master was missing from the Kaya Shrine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yagyu Munetoshi revealed a later plot point too early in the "Nobutsuna's Students" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not assassinate the Godai of Void because the NPC was missing. <em>He took his name too seriously.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest after dodge rolling and dropping Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest when there was no immediate option to carry Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players glitched through an anomaly in the "Heads Will Roll" quest, making Animus activities unavailable.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "Lost Honor" quest because the game failed to switch to Naoe.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress through the Tournament after dying.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Visuals &amp; Graphics</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed some minor visual issues.</li><li>Fixed misplaced visual elements with the Dark Woods Kusarigama.</li><li>Fixed an issue where all NPC horses appeared as identical.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with Naoe's Sekiryu outfit.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the "Bloodshade Katana" being visible out of the sheath when transmogged.</li><li>Fixed a movement physics issue with the Dead by Daylight Oni's armor.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Audio</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where footstep audio occasionally ceased when opening the map while moving.</li></ul></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-106-is-here-check-out-the-patch-notes]]></content:encoded>

                <p>IO Interactive has partnered with Moon Publishing to create Hitman: The Board Game. In it, up to four players can try their luck at taking down contracts using a variety of items and weapons pulled directly from past Hitman games. Hits will take place across the globe, as the game's various boards allow for a number of familiar locations to make an appearance. However, traps, different entry and exit points, and other obstacles should keep infiltrations feeling fresh.

		<p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it will be delaying the console release of System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, and that it will not be released on June 26th. This impacts all console platforms including Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation. The PC version is unaffected by the delay and it will release on June 26th as planned.</p>

<p>In a statement, Nightdive Studios said, <em>“We have encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles including Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation on June 26. We’re currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible. Because of this we’ve made the difficult decision to proceed with the game’s release on PC platforms (Steam, GOG, Epic, Humble) on June 26, with the console release now targeting the first two weeks of July. We’ll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo's</a> latest report on the top games globally by revenue and monthly active users (MAU) for May 2025 shows just how strong of a start <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> had, while Bethesda's return to Cyrodiil with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> firmly remaining in the top-20 games for both revenue and MAU.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launched right at the end of May on the 30th, and even though it arrived just before the month was done, it still managed to hit the number four spot on the top-20 games by revenue for May 2025. The only games ahead of it were the live service regulars, with Fortnite in the top spot, EA Sports FC 25 in second and Call of Duty in third.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered remains in the top-20 two months in a row, for both MAU and revenue, while the other major release from an Xbox-owned studio, id Software's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, makes the top-10 revenue list in the number nine spot.</p>
<p>Other notable titles on the revenue list are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which beat DOOM at number eight, and on the MAU list, the hype around <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> continues to go strong as it came in at number 15 for May 2025. Also, funnily enough, beating DOOM: The Dark Ages, which came in at number 16.</p>
<p>Here's Newzoo's full report overview for the top games on PC and consoles for May 2025:</p>
<h2>Engagement Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</strong>(#4, +1) saw a jump in engagement following the release of GTA VI’s second trailer on May 6 – the trailer amassed a record-breaking 475 million views across all platforms in the first 24 hours.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Apex Legends&nbsp;</strong>(#12, +3) gained 3 positions as it saw the introduction of a new Legend, Sparrow, and return of a legacy 3 vs 3 game mode – Arena, in a content update released on May 6.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>HELLDIVERS 2&nbsp;</strong>(#14, +18) saw a major content update on May 13 that introduced weapon customization, new enemies and balance adjustments. Moreover, on May 20 the “Heart of Democracy” update introduced urban environments to the game as players are now able to fight on Super Earth itself. The event not only diversifies gameplay but also builds the game’s tradition of turning events into meaningful community moments, driving strong player engagement.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Star Wars Battlefront II (2017)&nbsp;</strong>(#15, +90) experienced a significant surge in player engagement in May, through an organic community rally — highlighting strong and growing demand for a third installment in the series. This uptick followed Star Wars Day (May 4), which was marked by major discounts across all platforms that drew in new players. Despite the influx, 86% of May’s engagement came from returning players, underscoring the dedication and loyalty of the Battlefront II community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(16, new) launched to very positive reviews (86% on Steam and 86% Top Critic Average on Open Critic) and attracted massive amounts of players thanks to its day one availability on the Game Pass. Xbox users accounted for 72% of MAU, highlighting the platform’s dominant role in its success.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</h2>
<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>*We are currently experiencing a temporary outage which affects ROBLOX PC Revenues</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</strong>&nbsp;(#4, new) launched to mixed Steam reviews but has since managed to claw its way to ‘Very Positive’ at 80%. Our 6-market estimate sits at 3.5 million copies in May. The quick turnaround highlights the resilience of the ELDEN RING IP.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</strong>(#8, +5) moves up in the ranking after the release month, which is unusual for a premium title. It’s a showcase of the strength of a high-quality game and continued word-of-mouth marketing.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(#9, new) lands quite low on the list due to a big portion of revenues being tied to The Xbox Game Pass. In contrast to what we observed in the engagement highlights, over 95% of full game sales of the title come from PlayStation and PC (Steam).</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong>&nbsp;(#11, +30) announced a new paid ($39.99) expansion which became available for pre-order on May 6. Players enjoy regular events and new game modes as the game ramps up for the release of the expansion on July 15.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (</strong>#15, -13) makes it to the top 20 for the second month in a row, showcasing the hunger for a Bethesda fantasy RPG in the gaming community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</strong>(#20, new) launched to ‘Very Positive’ reviews (91% on Steam) and has already surpassed a million units sold across all platforms according to official communication from the developers. The blend of coziness and RPG elements has landed well with its target audience.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>A new update due today for the action/adventure fantasy game Eternal Strands is set to add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. The game has offered support for DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex since its launch in January 2025, and it's also possible to switch to the latest transformer AI model via the NVIDIA app, improving image quality. Now, though, the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will boost the frame rates of GeForce RTX 50 Series owners even further.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands admittedly already ran pretty well on release, as noted by Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review for Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>The developer also managed to keep the known UE5 stuttering issues to a minimum, as the game runs rather well most of the time. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution, epic settings with NVIDIA DLSS at the Ultra Quality setting, and Frame Generation at an average of 118 FPS in a benchmark session held in the Upper Dynevron map, one of the maps featuring the highest enemy density. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation off, the game ran at an average of 89 FPS on the same map, which was extremely playable. The recorded 1% lows, 25 and 35, however, highlight how there's still some stuttering here and there, but it's honestly not that noticeable. Considering the state of the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games and all the taxing simulation the game is doing at almost all times, I was expecting much worse, but there hasn't been a single time in my 35+ hours playthrough where framerates dipped so low that the game was unplayable.</em></p>
<p>Tomorrow, a seasonal update to the F2P anime third-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strinova </a>will introduce NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Similarly, later this week, another patch will add DLSS Super Resolution to Monster Energy Supercross 25 - The Official Video Game.</p>
<p>Lastly, on July 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV Season 9: Sins of the Horadrim</a> will introduce native NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support to Blizzard's game; the feature was previously only available through the NVIDIA app. The new season adds hidden Horadric Strongrooms deep within Nightmare Dungeons that conceal Blood Relics corrupted by Astaroth’s influence. Players can harness ancient Horadric magic to craft custom Horadric spells, forge powerful jewels, and face a reimagined Astaroth encounter.</p>

            <p>
How does one come up with, and subsequently make, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>? Well, it sounds like you just kind of have to do it in weird ways. If you've missed it, Peak isn't just slang you've heard your teen use to denote something being really good, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">co-op</a> video game about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">climbing mountains with your friends</a> and having a very good/ bad time while doing so. The bulk of work was also done in a single month as part of a collaborative game jam between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer Landfall. And in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/">PC Gamer</a>, a couple of the devs that worked on Peak have shared a little insight into how it got made.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Aggro Crab head Nick Kaman, Peak was made "mostly from jealousy." To be clear this sounds like mostly a joke, but for Kaman and the rest of Aggro Crab, this feeling came about when they learned that Content Warning was also made as part of a one-month long game jam, and sold ridiculously well. "It turned everything we know about game development upside-down," Kaman said.
</p>
<p>
"At the time we were on the precipice of launching our biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure—an intense 3+ year-long project that burnt a lot of us out. While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in MUCH less time." So, Kaman and two other devs at Aggro Crab asked if they could join Landfall for their next jam, conducted in Korea, the latter said yes and off they went.
</p>
<p>
"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks (that were donated to the local indie scene at the end of the month)."
</p>
<p>
Peak itself had actually been pitched the year prior… in a hot tub in Sweden, of all places, said Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that."
</p>
<p>
After that, all their time in Korea was spent either working on the game, or "getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman said. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I’ve ever had working on a game."
</p>
<p>
While sales are absolutely not an indicator of quality by any means, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">Peak has since gone on to sell a boatload too</a>. I mention only to point out that this doesn't mean the key to success is starting with a good idea and then only taking a month to make it. Both Aggro Crab and Landfall are experienced developers, so I beg of you, don't point to this as an example of a quick route to success.

Not content to rest on its laurels after the game's release, developer Shin'en is releasing a free content update later this week for the game that includes three new racetracks.</p><p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/exclusive-fast-fusions-first-major-update-arrives-this-week-with-three-new-tracks" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>, Fast Fusion's update will launch on June 26 and will include three new tracks, significantly expanding the game's offerings. From screenshots, these tracks will explore both urban and more natural areas, and will feature various types of weather.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5Hf2HIroc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this content drop, the update will also bring some tweaks and changes to help improve the game's performance. Shin'en is adding a "Pure" graphics mode that turns off upscaling and renders the game at 1440p dynamic resolution while docked and 1080p while handheld, in an effort to reduce any graphical blurriness caused by DLSS. The studio is also fixing some bugs and making progression slightly easier. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><p>Fast Fusion is the third entry in the Fast series of hovercraft racing games, and it boasts 4K/60FPS gameplay (enabled by DLSS). In addition to being one of the few exclusive games to the new console, it's also very accessible, costing only $15.
