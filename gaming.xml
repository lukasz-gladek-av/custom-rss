Preorders actually opened at the same time. Many fans had an Amazon preorder for nearly <em>eight </em>years before the retailer finally canceled all existing orders earlier this year. Prime 4 was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but the project was scrapped and restarted in 2019 by Retro Studios. The Nintendo subsidiary developed the previous three Prime games, and Beyond is led by the original producer Kensuke Tanabe. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes place after the events of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, though how far after remains unclear. What we do know is that it will see Samus explore an all-new planet, Viewros, populated by a new musical alien race called____ who have called on Samus to save the planet from an unknown threa. To aid in her adventure, the ____ imbue Samus with all-new psychic powers that will allow her to interface with the strange ruins and artifacts on Viewros and defend herself against the deadly creatures that live there.</p><p dir="ltr">As confirmed in an earlier gameplay trailer, Samus' enigmatic rival, Sylux, will also appear and likely play a pivotable role in the storyline. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising, and fans don't have to wait much longer to explore the planet of Viewros through Samus' iconic visor.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to play earlier Metroid Prime games before the Beyond arrives, unfortunately, the long-rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy for Switch never materialized. But you can at least play the gorgeous 2023 remaster of the original GameCube hit. Metroid Prime Remastered is a brilliant modernization of the 2002 classic. You can snag the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09YZNRQ7S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical edition for Nintendo Switch for $40</a> at Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press' most recent crowdfunding campaign is shaping up to be a bona fide success. Their recent <em>Northlands</em> Kickstarter is set to bring some Viking-themed adventure full of gods and giants to the most recent edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Northlands</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/northlands-norse-adventures-for-dandd-2024-and-tov/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Northlands</em></a> Kickstarter provides adventures to the latest edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> full of looting, runes, and horrific monsters themed around the Saga of Ragnarok. The project is for two books. The <em>Northlands Worldbook</em> is packed with new monsters, magic items, and player options. The <em>Northlands Sagas</em> book contains 11 prewritten adventures.</p>

One is designed for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024. The other is designed for Kobold Press' own 5e-inspired heroic fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tales of the Valiant</em></a>. The campaign also confirms that Northlands will be coing to various VTT platforms including Roll20, Foundry, and Shard.</p>

<p>In addition, all material in the <em>Northlands</em> Kickstarter books will be coming to D&amp;D Beyond. An apt form of forward-thinking since other third-party books like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-brings-dark-fantasy-to-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Grim Hollow</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crooked-moon-dd-5e-supplement-reveals-stoneborn-and-threadborn-species-exclusive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Crooked Moon</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/flee-mortals-now-available-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Flee Mortals!</em></a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for the Northlands Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Northlands Worldbook PDF for $29:</strong> A digital copy of the Worldbook for either <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> or <em>Tales of the Valiant</em></li>
	<li><strong>All PDFs for $39:</strong> Digital copies of both the Worldbook and Sagas for either <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> or <em>Tales of the Valiant</em></li>
	<li><strong>Northlands Hardcover + PDF for $59:</strong> Both a hardcover and digital copy of the Worldbook for either <em>D&amp;D&nbsp;2024</em> or <em>Tales of the Valiant</em></li>
	<li><strong>Northlands: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beyond for $69:</strong> Both Worldbook and Sagas on D&amp;D Beyond</li>
	<li><strong>Complete Northlands Digital for $99:</strong> Both books in both PDF and on D&amp;D Beyond</li>
	<li><strong>Worldbook Limited Edition for $99:</strong> A limited hardcover edition of the Worldbook with special foil stamping and ribbon bookmark alongside a PDF copy</li>

	<li><strong>Limited Edition Complete Bundle for $169:</strong> Everything in the Complete Bundle as well as a Limited Edition hardcover of the Worldbook</li>

However, players on Switch 2 and Xbox take advantage of more than just the Yuffie-centered add-on story, Episode INTERmission, when Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade arrives in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A digital limited early purchase bonus will also be available until January 31, 2026, and grants access to the original Final Fantasy 7 at no extra charge. Those who pre-order on Xbox will be able to play the 1997 JRPG classic the instant their purchase is locked in, while Switch 2 players will have to wait until the January 22 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 players, specifically, can also take advantage of a unique offer that lets them in on the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day">craze surrounding the Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy crossover</a>.

This will appear in-game in the form of five new options to make the experience easier for players if they choose to utilize them. Available options include HP that is always full, MP that is always full, a Limit gauge that is always full, an ATB gauge that is always full, and 9999 damage for every attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Naoki Hamaguchi shared <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a statement</u></a> regarding the decision to offer streamlined gameplay options for new platforms, explaining that the team wanted to “allow the game to cater for individual players’ different lifestyles and play styles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days,” Hamaguci adds, “as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest. I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade - PC screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix also <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966514225117118813" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirms</a> that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tetsuya-nomura-offers-promising-update-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-and-kingdom-hearts-4">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy</a> will eventually make its way to Switch 2 and Xbox platforms, as well as PS5 and PC.

The PlayStation version has even longer completion times. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is a traditional single-player JRPG that has your unnamed character and a team of adventurers sailing around, traversing islands, and completing quests to help people out on each one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the art, Square Enix wrote in its announcement, “The character designs, originally crafted by world-renowned manga artist Akira Toriyama, have been reimagined into a charming 3D art style using dolls actually created in the real world.” That’s wild. The graphics look great, though, almost toy-like in that Link’s Awakening remake sort of way.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feel free to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">everything else announced during today's Nintendo Direct</a>, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">new Super Mario Galaxy bundle</a> for Nintendo Switch. </p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">Borderlands 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-story-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

<p>It's been a busy day thanks to Nintendo's huge hour-long Direct, but the Japanese broadcast still managed to have a surprise in store for us — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch in 2026, Capcom announced the collection via the Japanese showcase, but also dropped an English trailer, confirming we'd be seeing the remastered set in the West in 2026. The game will also be at this year's Tokyo Game Show.<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force"><br></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force">Mega Man Star Force</a> is a subseries of RPGs that launched on the DS between 2007 and 2009, to coincide with the Blue Bomber's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>And, in this collection, all three games are included — Mega Man Star Force, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_2">Mega Man Star Force 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force_3">Mega Man Star Force 3</a>, along with their respective additional versions.

<ul>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li>

<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</li>
</ul>
<p>These games continue to evolve the gameplay from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_battle_network_legacy_collection">Mega Man Battle Network</a>, though back in the day, many critics thought the newer titles didn't go far enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>, renowned cRPG developer Owlcat Games proved it has everything needed to tackle a sprawling adventure set in the vast universe created by Games Workshop, beyond having the chops to adapt tabletop RPGs into engaging cRPGs, as already shown in previous games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, especially. Not content with having upped their game with their title set in the Warhammer 40K universe, Owlcast Games is ready to the return to the Imperium with another adaptation of a tabletop RPG,<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy/"> Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>, which promises to be the best game to date from the developer.</p>



<p>During last month's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to attend a hands-off session set at around 15 hours into the game which did an excellent job showcasing how Owlcat Games is building on the foundation laid by Rogue Trader to offer a much better experience. The choice of protagonist and setting within the Warhammer 40K universe - an Inquisitor traveling in the Calixis Sector to investigate a series of events and uncover the mysteries behind the Tyrant Star, which has the power to destroy planets - is a marked difference from Rogue Trader, allowing for some interesting narrative possibilities. Being part of the secret police force and intelligence service of the Imperium makes each Inquisitor not only feared but also essentially untouchable by anyone, as what an Inquisitor says is the truth, no matter what anyone else thinks. With this premise in mind, Owlcat Games created an adventure where there's no right or wrong, but only consequences to one's actions, which can be dealt with in many different ways.</p>



<p>This setup and how it influences Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy was clearly evident in the Gamescom demo, which featured an investigation into a series of mysterious disappearances set on Scintilla. The game features a lot of environmental storytelling, which works extremely well with the investigation features that require the Inquisitor to find clues to complete investigations. After discovery, these clues are added to an Investigation Journal where companions provide additional insight, which is a very nice touch to make them feel more involved into the story even if they play no major role in certain quests. Once insights have been gathered by checking the enovrionment and talking with NPCs, it is possible to recreate the chain of events and make the Inquisitor pass judgment on the case. As mentioned above, the word of an Inquisitor is absolute, so there are no wrong answers and no ways to fail investigations, only different consequences that must be dealt with, in typical Owlcat fashion.</p>

<p>Together with the investigation mechanics, exploration and combat will play a significant role in the Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy experience. Things have improved considerably in both cases since Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader: maps are now bigger, more detailed than ever before, and with imrpoved verticality that makes them feel even bigger. On the surface, however, combat doesn't seem to have changed a lot, but the devil is in the details, as a lot of tweaks have been made to the turn-based system seen in Rogue Trader that will make fighting enemies in Dark Heresy much more enjoyable. The cover system, for example, has been overhauled with the removal of half-covers and the ability to target covers to reduce the enemy's defensive options. A new targeting system has also been implemented to allow players to target different body parts to debuff the enemy and disable certain abilities of theirs, adding more strategic depth alongside the Concentration mechanics, which allow the player to prevent any enemy from using a powerful attack by using certain type of attacks, such as grenades, before the attack goes off as indicated in the Initiative Bar. Based on the momentum system from Rogue Trader, the Morale system is another central addition that will impact combat considerably, as low morale causes enemies to make stupid decisions beneficial to the player. Another excellent quality of life improvement is how a battle can be ended once it is determined that the enemy has no chance of winning. Players can still decide to continue, but the rewards will be the same if the battle is ended earlier, so taking advantage of this system sounds like the way to go to enhance the game's pace.</p>



<p>At a glance, Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy may not look that different from Rogue Trader, but the new main character and setting, visual improvements, investigation mechanics, and combat improvements are set to make it a much better game that will retain that unique flavor Owlcat Games infuses in its cRPG. Despite having a really basic knowledge of the Warhammer 40K universe, I really enjoyed with I saw of the game during Gamescom, and I can't wait to experience more of this morally gray adventure when it launches on a yet to be confirmed release date.</p>

Ahead of the game's debut later this month, Keepsake Games has set the price for Jump Space and laid out the update calendar well into 2026.</p><p>On Bluesky, Keepsake announced that Jump Space's early access release will be available for $20 on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 19. Chapter 1: The Resistance Coalition will begin at the start of early access, with Chapter 2: Atira Strikes Back launching by early 2026. In a series of short updates in that time frame, Keepsake plans to introduce text chat, hangar vendors, a ship shield revamp, melee weapons, an expanded story, new missions, photo mode, and other additions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165" data-ratio="4.0733333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165"></a><figcaption>The roadmap for Jump Space's updates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>In Q1 2026, Chapter 3: Secrets of the Telmari will bring support for a first-person mode, more sectors, a scanner revamp, voice chat, new enemies, and a ground boss into the game. There are plans for Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption before the game exits early access. However, there are no dates or concrete details about when that might occur.</p><p>Until fairly recently, this game was known as Jump Ship before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-forced-to-change-name-to-jump-space-due-to-trademark-issues/1100-6533707/" data-ref-id="1100-6533707">the name was changed over trademark issues</a>. Jump Space is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games-steam/2900-6905/" data-ref-id="2900-6905">co-op game</a> that brings together up to four players as the crew of a ship that can control and repair their shared vessel. The gameplay resembles Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, with some additional sci-touches touches like planetary exploration and space walks. It's a dangerous galaxy out there, and players will run into trouble when enemies appear during on-foot encounters or during space combat when the crew is still on their ship. However, the game is strictly PvE, rather than PvP.</p><p>Keepsake Games has previously mentioned that Jump Space will feature several "handcrafted missions with random elements" to keep the game fresh. More than 1 million players have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted Jump Space on Steam</a>.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The T.E.D.D. operator now looks less human and more like the robot originally featured in Black Ops 2's Zombies mode. The flesh has melted off his face to show more of his robotic features. The bonus T.E.D.D. skin added to the Vault Edition bundle will look more like the original Black Ops 7 design that was announced, but Activision says it does have some minor changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567169" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567169"></a><figcaption>Redesigned Vault operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Karma, her holographic plates and visor have been adjusted. This redesign shows more of her face than the original version. Harper's operator skin also has slight adjustments with armor now recolored and looking more streamlined. The only operator who didn't receive a change is Reaper EWR-3.</p><p dir="ltr">The operators' new looks can be seen in the image above. A more detailed 360-degree-look at the skins can be seen in the videos shared on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/black-ops-7-vault-edition-operators-update" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty's blog</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says these changes were made as part of Call of Duty's commitment to the "authentic look and feel of Black Ops 7," and after receiving community feedback specifically related to the Black Ops 7 Vault Edition operators.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher recently made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/">changes to Call of Duty's Carry Forward program</a>, allowing only specific skins and items to transfer from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7. This will include some of the Zombies-themed skins players earned by completing the main story quests, but wacky skins like Ninja Turtles and Beavis and Butt-Head won't carry over.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bluesky-really-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-people-to-say-%E2%80%98rest-in-piss%E2%80%99-about-charlie-kirk.1296807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, I got suspended from Bluesky for writing “rest in piss” while resharing <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my piece about liberal media’s frothy race to eulogize Charlie Kirk</a>. I quickly learned that I was not alone.</p><p>As it turns out, Bluesky’s moderation team has zapped (at least) dozens of people for using that phrase while sharing posts about&nbsp;Kirk or longer descriptions of his legacy both before and after me, but not everyone who uses that phrase in isolation, as evidenced by posts that were still live on the site at the time of my suspension and had been for a day or more. </p><p>Over the course of the last night, Bluesky took aim at many but not all posts wishing Kirk a restorative piss bath, and its approach seemed to change as I and others appealed our suspensions. Some were just standard users, but I’m not the only reporter who was hit by Bluesky’s anti-piss defense system, with investigative journalist and hacktivist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crimew.gay/post/3lymfmyzk2k2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maia Arson Crimew</a> copping a suspension for posting the same phrase.</p><figure><figcaption>The original post is gone, but imagine this on Bluesky instead of Twitter.</figcaption></figure><p>The reason provided to me and others by an automated Bluesky email was that typing the phrase “rest in piss” is tantamount to "glorifying violence, including the promotion of harmful acts that cause widespread harm and suffering, as well as showing admiration or glorification of the offenders responsible for such acts."&nbsp;</p><p>I appealed my suspension, arguing a simple counterpoint: No it isn’t.</p><figure></figure><p>I guess it worked, because a couple hours later, Bluesky’s moderation team un-suspended me. They offered little in the way of an explanation, saying in another automated email that “after a review of our decision, we've decided to restore your account.” But they did not reinstate my original post, confusingly implying that it remains in violation of the rules. Did I break the rules or didn’t I? What’s going on?</p><p>There are other factors to consider: Aftermath is one of the biggest video game publications on Bluesky in terms of sheer follower count, and Luke’s post about my suspension garnered over 2.5k likes. Additionally, I – via Riley – made it publicly known that I was working on this story. Some who are not reporters with decently sizable followings remain suspended as of this publishing despite sending appeals, while others who were suspended the day before yesterday told Aftermath that they were forced to serve their full 24-hour sentences, also despite appealing. Others still, like a 3D animator who goes by the handle <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raptornx01.bsky.social/post/3lymg4aopc22w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raptor</a>, told Aftermath that they did not have to spend their full 24 hours in timeout because their suspensions, for whatever reason, lifted early.&nbsp;</p><p>A few users told Aftermath that their anti-Kirk posts were deleted sans a suspension or any sort of notification. One such post read: "Charlie Kirk has been pronounced dead from complications resulting from his dick and balls being the wrong way around. His dick was on the bottom and his balls were on top. A bullet was also found in his body."</p><p>It is unclear whether the crackdown on “rest in piss,” specifically, is the result of automated moderation software, a bad-faith mass report campaign, some combination of the two, or something else. The sheer inconsistency of which posts received deletions or user suspensions, and when and for how long, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/bluesky-rolls-out-automated-moderation-tools-plus-user-and-moderation-lists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky’s own words about its approach to moderation</a>, suggests at least some level of direct human intervention, but the scale and frequency of that effort is unclear. In the past, Bluesky has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/12/24098920/bluesky-custom-moderation-filters-ozone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted of a more open approach to moderation</a> that lets users build their own layers atop the services Bluesky offers, allowing them to annotate or hide certain types of posts if they so choose. However, as seen in this instance, the buck still ultimately stops with the company.</p><p>“I've been making bait posts all night just to see what's going down,” Mira, a journalist who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thefreeradical.org/post/3lymi5do7u227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a warning email</a> about their post being removed but not a suspension, told Aftermath. “My bet is they have an outsourced team of content mods who are all told different things. I used to work as a content mod for TikTok, and shit like this happened there a lot. But also who knows.”</p><p>Today, Mira told Aftermath that Bluesky did not go after any of their intentionally provocative posts.</p><p>“They also didn't respond to my appeal [of the post removal] or any message of mine in general," Mira said. "Completely ghosted, and my account's still up."</p><p>Crimew, another reporter with a decently sized following, also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crimew.gay/post/3lymfjqh7zk2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got un-suspended</a> last night after appealing, though again, Bluesky did not immediately reinstate her post or a threaded reply in which she told Bluesky to rest in piss. But it did reinstate <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lylxjacjfc2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the threaded replies to my original post</a> – which are unkind to a different dead person, Henry Kissinger – despite not reinstating the original post. And now, today, Bluesky suddenly reinstated Crimew's original post, but not the threaded reply, all with no explanation.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Many of the suspension and ban posts I’ve seen have absolutely no logical explanation and genuinely make no sense.</p></blockquote></figure><p>One user, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rilder.bsky.social/post/3lymdv6entc2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olive</a>, reached out shortly after I got unsuspended to let me know that Bluesky had just removed her piss post and issued a warning with the same language about glorification of violence, but had not suspended her. Others quickly got in touch to report similar experiences. I began to feel like I was watching Bluesky rewrite its own internal moderation policies or attempt to triangulate a new approach in real time while, crucially, not publicly sharing the underlying rationale.&nbsp;</p><p>Bluesky has also sent out at least two different moderation emails in response to piss posts: the one I received and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raptornx01.bsky.social/post/3lymg4aopc22w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> sent to me by a few users that includes a bullet-pointed list of potential violations like “threats of violence or physical harm,” “⁠incitement of self-harm or suicide,” and “wishes of harm,” while still not explaining how the specific post in question violates those rules. How it decides which email of two different emails to send for the same violation is not evident. One user, Redd Carpenter, received the second email in relation to their entire account, rather than a specific post, and it seems that their suspension is indefinite.</p><p>"It goes without saying that I did not post any threats of violence, incitement of self-harm, wishes of harm, or any kind of illegal content that would cross the Bluesky TOS," Carpenter told Aftermath. "In fact I had even made posts reminding people to avoid 'fedposting,' or making posts that would land them under federal scrutiny, ironically. … The most pointed comment I made about Charlie in response to some troll account was 'He became a victim of the world he sought to create for others.' The fact that the email didn't highlight a specific post I made that led to my suspension is what's most odd to me, as I haven't seen anyone else get this kind of message, but I have no idea what this could mean."</p><p>Typically, an extremely specific moderation quirk would not be notable enough to warrant an article on the same esteemed website that recently played host to “<a href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Long Handheld</a>,” but it appears there’s been an uptick in moderation across Bluesky – a burgeoning social media platform with a liberal bent – in relation to the death of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative.</p><p>“Bluesky moderation is absolutely out of fucking control right now, just absolutely arbitrary politically motivated suspensions and bans,” reads <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinbiba.bsky.social/post/3lylrwfgbx22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent post</a> from freelance science journalist Erin Biba with over 2k likes. “Many of the suspension and ban posts I’ve seen have absolutely no logical explanation and genuinely make no sense.”&nbsp;</p><p>"Bluesky moderation is suspending people for posting Kirk's own words, which tells you everything you need to know," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prisonculture.bsky.social/post/3lyjlr7juik2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads a post</a> from Prisonculture, a popular account run by activist Mariame Kaba, with over 7k likes.</p><p>On September 10, shortly after the shooting, Bluesky’s safety account <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/safety.bsky.app/post/3lyjbpivaoc2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted the following</a>: “Glorifying violence or harm violates Bluesky’s Community Guidelines. We review reports and take action on content that celebrates harm against anyone. Violence has no place in healthy public discourse, and we’re committed to fostering healthy, open conversations.”</p><p>But “rest in piss” does not celebrate harm; as I said in my appeal, it suggests that a person is not good simply because they’re dead. Also, on a basic verbal level, it implores them to rest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's big Nintendo Direct event included the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Mario-Tennis-Fever-2915160.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, the tenth game in this specific Mario-branded sports series. The last one was 2018's Mario Tennis Aces, which launched for the original Nintendo Switch with a fairly positive reception from critics and fans. Back then, the game got an 8 out of 10 score from Wccftech reviewer Dave Aubrey, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-tennis-aces-a-fancy-racket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Mario Tennis Aces is one of the best Mario Tennis games, and well worth it for gamers that love to sit back with groups of friends. If you appreciate a good game of tennis with some whacky rules to spice it all up, you'll surely enjoy this.</em></p>



<p>The new one, Mario Tennis Fever, will be released on February 12, 2026 for the Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $69.99. Based on Nintendo's description, fans will find new defensive maneuvers and a brand-new Fever Gauge that will allow players to unleash powerful Fever Shots. These shots can be further enhanced with special effects by equipping Fever Rackets: the Ice Racket freezes the court, the Mini Mushroom Racket shrinks opponents, and the Shadow Racket duplicates yourself. In the final game, there will be a total of thirty different Fever Rackets and thirty-eight playable characters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In Tournament mode, players will get play-by-play commentary from a Talking Flower. Trial Towers Mode lets players test their skills while they complete various objectives in Trial Towers mode, and Mix It Up Mode will introduce unexpected rules to spice up the formula. </p>



<p>Online multiplayer is supported for casual matches with customizable rules in an Online Room, or in the competitive Ranked Matches. Mario Tennis Fever also supports a special Swing Mode for the Joy-Con 2 controller to enhance the feeling of actually playing tennis.</p>



<p>Lastly, the developers promised a story-driven Adventure Mode in which Mario and his friends encounter monsters on a remote island and find themselves transformed into babies. Players will have to help them relearn their tennis skills and defeat the monsters to return to normal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A contingent of right-wing online figures and their followers have been using the recent assassination of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk to punish people they don’t like. That includes a developer at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> maker Sucker Punch Productions who Sony confirms it has parted ways with after she made a joke on social media about the shooting.</p> <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” Drew Harrison, a nearly 10-year veteran of the PlayStation studio, posted in the evening after Kirk was shot and killed during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. A few hours later, the post was screen-grabbed and shared by anti-woke crusader Mark “Grummz” Kern.</p> <p>“Suckerpunch Senior Dev celebrates Charlie Kirk’s death,” he wrote. “<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is dead to me now.” A streamer who goes by Madamsavvy responded, “No more. Cowards keep quiet. The studio deserves to go under.” Kern replied, “No mercy.”</p>

 <p>Harrison subsequently shared on social media that people had been contacting her employer angrily trying to get her fired, and posted a screenshot of a barrage of missed calls from anonymous numbers as evidence of an ongoing harassment campaign. Less than 24 hours later, she was fired.</p> <p>“If standing up against fascism is what cost me my dream job I held for 10 years, I would do it again 100x stronger,” she wrote.</p> <p>Sony confirmed her departure in an email to <em>Kotaku</em> but declined to comment further. “Drew Harrison is no longer an employee of Sucker Punch Productions,” a spokesperson from Sony Interactive Entertainment wrote.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1 It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.</p> <p>2 it's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?</p> <p>— shawn layden 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇸🇯🇵 (@ShawnLayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A loosely aligned “Gamergate 2.0” movement that <a href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">grew out of conspiracy theories claiming DEI</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428"> was ruining gaming</a> has been hoping for this sort of outcome for months. The big PS5 exclusive has been in anti-woke activists’ firing line ever since <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> revealed the open-world samurai series’ latest entry would star a woman named Atsu, played by Erika Ishii.</p> <p>Fed by an algorithmically juiced YouTube rage factory, certain online culture content creators latched onto one of Ishii’s past comments about abolishing the police as a way to attack the game. Videos with titles like “<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> DOOMED? Radical Activist Erika Ishii Brings Woke Chaos!” later changed to things like “<em>Ghost Of Yotei</em> New Trailer Sparks BACKLASH, Hiring Activists Backfires For Sony &amp; Sucker Punch” as YouTubers combed LinkedIn for evidence proving that people with opinions they disagreed with were ruining games.</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is far from the only high-profile blockbuster game to be dragged into this culture war quicksand. Kern and others attacked Ubisoft’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> as well for featuring an African samurai as one of its two main characters. Developers on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly told not to comment</a> on the harassment campaign when the game launched earlier this year.</p> <p>While Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot condemned attacks targeting employees, he also said at the time the company was working on “tackling the dynamics behind the polarized comments around Ubisoft so as to protect the Group’s reputation and maximize our game’s sales potential.”</p> <p>Members of the harassment campaign to get Harrison fired from Sucker Punch are already targeting individuals at other game studios and publishers over their social media comments. “Every single studio is compromised,” one of them wrote. “And it’s all American leftists doing this.”</p>

According to in-game messaging, any players who earn a win this weekend in the Six Stack (Pure Chaos) variety of the recently added Blitz Royale mode will be granted the new Bug Punk Sunny skin on Monday. Yes, this is the first-ever new version of Sunny, the popular alien fangirl character from the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567116"></a><figcaption>You can earn the Bug Punk Sunny skin in Fortnite Blitz Royale this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg"></figure><p>For those who aren't up to date on Fortnite's many different battle royale modes, Blitz Royale is a small-scale mode with a max of 32 players and matches that last five minutes or less that was added this summer as an appeal to mobile gamers after Fortnite returned to iOS in the USA. But Blitz Royale is not exclusive to mobile devices--you can play the mode on any platform Fortnite works on. And in Six Stack (Pure Chaos) mode, there are teams of six players, and no bots or skill-based matchmaking, and so with the quick nature of these games this version of the mode tends to get pretty wild.</p><p>It's already a pretty momentous occasion for Blitz Royale, which replaced its entire map on Friday with a new island that's full of stuff owned by Tony Stark/Iron Man--in fact, these locations come from Chapter 2 Season 4, which was the first full-on Marvel season back in the fall of 2020. But the makeover isn't just an aesthetic one, because the loot pool is also now full of Marvel items, including the frequently maligned War Machine items that were everyone's bane during Chapter 5 Season 4.</p><p>Bug Punk Sunny is the ninth free skin that Epic Games has offered Fortnite players this year, and there was a tenth skin, Skulldroid, that cost 100 V-Bucks for folks who had received free Twitch drops of his accessories. That's already more free skins in 2025 than we'd normally get in a full calendar year, and we're still three months away from Winterfest, which has traditionally been Fortnite's biggest source of free skins.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2025, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-shifts-from-f2p-mmo-to-regular-survival-game-will-debut-next-year-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> of Crosswind's early access debut planned for sometime next year, I met with producer Philip Molodkovets to discuss the promising game openly inspired by Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Originally planned to launch as a free-to-play MMO, Crosswind has been retooled into a premium 'survival adventure game' with support for online co-op. The studio is planning between twelve and eighteen months of early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> before 1.0, at which point there will also be a launch on consoles.</p>

<p><strong>Philip, can you let me know what you're showing today?</strong></p>



<p>It's a new build that combines some of the content features already present in our Alpha test and also some of the work-in-progress stuff we're working on. Right now, our goal is to release the game in early access in 2026.</p>



<p>Let's start with the base building since it's one of the most important features in the genre. We developed the base entirely using in-game tools and resources. With our building system, we try to be as flexible as possible. We have dozens, if not hundreds, of building blocks and different styles to mix and adjust to your own liking. We want players to be as creative as they want. One of my colleagues responsible for the building system says that a game's building system is good enough if you can build a Millennium Falcon from Star Wars, so we did just that.</p>



<p>On this base, you'll notice crafting benches, workstations, and NPCs. While you progress through Crosswind, you can recruit various NPCs. Some are specialists who will enhance your production and maybe teach some recipes, and some are just NPC workers. In time, you'll be able to automate some tasks like chopping trees, for example, mining rocks. It's not that much fun to do it, so you have workers who can do it for you. And now we are going to our dock, where we have the smallest ship docked. The naval part of the game is heavily inspired by Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, which we consider to be the best pirate game ever made. </p>



<p>Since the Alpha test, we have done a lot of work to improve the naval part of Crosswind. Of course, you've got a crew, and they are perishables. If you get into combat, they can get hit by a cannonball and die. If you board an enemy ship, they will help you with the boarding. They move and do different tasks depending on what you do, for example, if I aim my cannon, they will run to other cannons and start shooting them. Also, we reworked the water system's physics so it feels more rocky.</p>



<p>This is our first map, an archipelago. We use procedural generation combined with handcrafted points of interest. The terrain and island layout are procedurally generated, so each player will have a unique world, but we use handcrafted temples, dungeons, and bandit camps placed all over the map.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We use procedural generation combined with handcrafted points of interest.

<p><strong>How does player progression work in Crosswind?</strong></p>



<p>You can craft and upgrade all types of gear: your armor, clothing, weapons, and jewelry. We also have player stats corresponding to different types of damage, protection, and health. You can increase the stats while using different gear. You can customize your character to be a long-range musketeer, for example, or perhaps you want to use a saber and pistol and get up close.</p>



<p>Now, we are going to use our voyage tool. We're going to travel to the Ashlands, a separate map and our fourth biome. It's currently a work in progress. In terms of how we approach biomes, we try not just to make them visually different. Each biome will have different enemies, resources, recipes, and there is a boss you have to defeat in the end. But also, we try to introduce different exploration mechanics.</p>



<p>The Ashlands region was covered by a volcanic eruption 100 years ago. Now, a lot of the interesting stuff there is covered by volcanic ash, so you'll have to take a pickaxe and dig through this to uncover some secrets. Another thing we're really trying to do is make the naval and land parts of the game seamless so that there are no loading screens. You can swim to an island, explore, and get back to the ship. The food system is similar to Valheim. I can eat three different types of food, and I increase my stats and HP.</p>



<p><strong>Can you craft all the weapons in Crosswind, or are there some that can only be obtained by defeating certain foes?</strong></p>



<p>Most of the weapons are crafted. There are also some drops from bosses, for example, from chests, but for most of the things, you just unlock the recipe, gather resources, and craft them and improve them on your base. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We'd like to call our combat system Soulslite. It's inspired by the Souls games, but not as challenging. We have light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parry, and dash. There are also some combo chains.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How does combat work in the game?</strong></p>



<p>We'd like to call our combat system Soulslite. It's inspired by the Souls games, but not as challenging. We have light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parry, and dash. There are also some combo chains.</p>



<p>We did an Alpha test earlier this Summer and players really commended us for these points of interest because it's not just, you know, procedurally generated biomes. The game also contains a lot of custom-made, interesting dungeons, temples with traps and the like, so we are trying to double down on this. We're making more of this, introducing more points of interest to the game.</p>



<p>The final destination of today's demo is Tortuga. Back in the days when we were working on Crosswind as an MMO, we thought it would be a social habit for players, a shared area. We reworked it quite a lot, and now it's like an outpost where you can get some quests and sell goods. Surviving pirates are fighting against zombies there, so it is a besieged city. </p>



<p>For now, the wind does not affect your ship's movement; it's only cosmetic and affects the waves, the trees, and the bushes. We are already working on ship customization options, so the player can actually make the ship feel like a home. It is indeed a second base, essentially. Obviously, you'll use that ship's storage as a deposit, which is useful during exploration. </p>



<p>As I said, we're pretty inspired by Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, but we're trying to make our naval combat a bit more tactical. We added different types of ammo. You have weak spots on the ship; you have ricochet, so you can angle your ship to avoid damage. </p>



<p><strong>The plan is to launch on early access, correct?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we'd like to go through early access on PC starting next year.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a rough idea of how long you plan to stay in early access before the 1.0 launch?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, for now, we predict that it will take us roughly one year to one year and a half to get to version 1.0. We want to build new content and we also want to go to consoles after early access.</p>



<p><strong>Will Crosswind eventually support cross-play with consoles? </strong></p>



<p>It would be cool. We're just not working on consoles that much right now because we need to focus on what we're doing, but for example, we've already added controller support to the game. So, hopefully yes to cross-play.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We are actually trying to make a survival adventure game. This is why some of the survival elements are not as hardcore. For example, you cannot die of starvation. You just have some very, very low HP. There is also no degradation of tools. You don't need to repair your tools all the time. So, some of the hardcore survival elements, we don't do them so that the player can concentrate on the adventure side.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Speaking of the survival side of your game, is it fair to say it's not too hardcore, and perhaps more similar to Valheim in that respect?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, because we are actually trying to make a survival adventure game. This is why some of the survival elements are not as hardcore. For example, you cannot die of starvation. You just have some very, very low HP. There is also no degradation of tools. You don't need to repair your tools all the time. So, some of the hardcore survival elements, we don't do them so that the player can concentrate on the adventure side.</p>



<p><strong>What is the maximum number of players in a session now that Crosswind has shifted from MMO to online co-op?</strong></p>



<p>On the Alpha test, we managed to support groups of three players, but now we're working to expand it to at least four, and we'll see. Obviously, we absolutely don't mind doing more. We just need to understand our technical limitations because we're transitioning from our previous plan to make an MMO to another kind of game, so we are figuring this out.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about Tortuga itself?</strong></p>



<p>Sure. The centre of the city is a small tavern. The tavern keeper is the leader of Tortuga's survivors, so we can talk to him, learn some details about the war, absolutely care for now. And also, there are various NPC characters that you can meet here and recruit. So, for example, Mary is an alchemist. If you recruit her, she'll go to your base and improve your alchemy there. Another guy here is a woodcutter; he can order your woodworkers to be more efficient. Less time, less payment. And there is another type of NPC, an officer for the player ship. Hiring an officer will improve the ship's capabilities These guys cannot die, so they are more like equipment for the ship rather than regular sailors.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that Tortuga is under attack from zombies. Can you talk about the narrative, then? Will there be a story to follow?</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. We are not a roleplaying game, but we do our best to introduce more story to our game compared to many other survival games so that the player may find purpose. Crosswind starts with you as a freelance courier transporting an artifact back to London, but your ship gets intercepted and your cargo is lost. You are attacked by Blackbeard pirates who steal your artifact, and then you're stranded on an island. You have to work your way to survive, to find and repair a ship, and gather a crew.</p>



<p>Eventually, it will expand into a big conflict involving empires and different factions in the game. It's still a work in progress, but even on early access, we plan the main core story to take like 60, maybe 68 hours of time. Not all of it will be doing quests, of course, as there will also be exploration and crafting to do, but I mean, there will be a good chunk of story, and it will not be complete. It will be like the story's first chapter, because we also have plans for future content on how to drive the story further. Again, don't overthink it. We are not an RPG, so we will not have all those fancy cutscenes and dialogues, but we have this narrative and we want it to be meaningful. It's not just exploring and surviving; you have to go to retrieve this artifact, and then it spins into a complicated conflict between different parties.</p>

<p><strong>Can you do all this narrative part while playing with other players if you want?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Even on the Alpha test, people were able to do it. We want to fully support co-op, so essentially, if you complete something with your friend, for example, he asks you to play with him, you complete some quest, and on your side, this progress will be carried over. We want to make it work so you can play anytime alone, then connect with your friends and your progress will stay with you.</p>



<p><strong>What is the status of the gamepad support?</strong></p>



<p>It's not 100% in. It's not perfect, but it's fully supported in the UI. We already tested it, and actually, some of the Alpha testers played with a controller as well. There are players who play with controllers on PC, so we want to support it. And anyway, we'll have to do it for consoles, so we're trying to build it, along with mouse and keyboard, from the start.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share when the next testing phase of Crosswind will open up to the public?</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I am not even sure there will be an open test before the early access release. It will depend on how the development goes. We're still processing feedback from the Alpha test and creating a roadmap towards the early access release.</p>



<p><strong>Honestly, as an MMO fan, I was a bit sad when you switched the game away from that toward regular co-op survival. </strong></p>



<p>Yeah, I know there are players who used to play ATLAS, for example, and they were expecting us to cater to that kind of game. The problem is, we realised during the Alpha test that in terms of amount of work and technical limitations, it would be very risky to keep pursuing this huge scope, so we decided to narrow it down a bit and make one thing right. And maybe then we can build on this once we have more experience. It's better to make a good survival game than to make a bad MMO game.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. How many employees do you have currently at Crosswind Crew?</strong></p>



<p>Right now, around 70 people are working on it.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a headquarters?</strong></p>



<p>We have offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and Hong Kong, while the rest of the team is distributed remotely.</p>



<p><strong>Anything more you can say about the early access window?</strong></p>



<p>Just that it's coming in 2026, and the exact release window will be announced later, when we understand how much we need to do before going there.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In August, the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was a massive success and one of the most played games of the year. But there was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797#:~:text=While%20some%20players,in%20the%20game.">controversial “quick turn” setting</a> included in the beta that caused some debate online. And when I asked the devs why it was added, they said: Balance and customization.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I had to ask about the <a href="https://x.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713">quick turn feature</a>. People online suggested it looked like cheating and was too OP. Others claimed it helped balance <em>BF6</em> by giving controller players a chance to turn around quickly. According to&nbsp;Matthew Nickerson, senior console combat designer on <em>Battlefield 6,</em> balancing the game was indeed one reason it was added.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The inherent issue of including aim assist on controller,” Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em>,&nbsp; “[is that] you constantly are doing a big sweeping motion [while looking around], you’re constantly going full speed, and then you hit the bubbles of aim assist, and it automatically slows down. So you’re kind of constantly fighting these systems that are preventing you from quickly 180 turning.”</span></p>

 <p>Adding a quick flip option was a “huge win” that solved a “lot of issues” that exist when playing on a controller against mouse and keyboard players.</p> <p><span>“You know, you get shot in the back [and] it’s frustrating to be a controller player those days,” added Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>According to him, making sure crossplay was balanced, fair, and fun was a huge goal for the entire team working on <em>Battlefield 6</em>. So the quick turn option, officially known as “Flick Stick,” was one more way to keep crossplay competitive for all.</p>

 <p>The other reason for adding it? Well, because it’s cool and gives players one more way to customize their controls and gameplay. And combined with the PS5’s gyro controls, Flick Stick can do some “really cool stuff.” Plus, Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em> it helps give console players more ways to interact with the game despite gamepads having far fewer buttons than a keyboard.</p> <p><span>“If you want to reload [or turn around], maybe you just flick on your controller upright, and it activates the gyro, so it’s like</span><span> another new layer of customizability,” said Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>I’m not sure I’ll be using gyro controls in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. But you’d better believe I’ll have a button set for turning around instantly so I can at least I can see the person killing me from behind.</p>
