			<p>We first learned of Bethesda's plans for a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake thanks to an inadvertent <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit in Summer 2023. A document that included Bethesda's internal release schedule before the pandemic was uploaded to the public documentation shared for the lawsuit. Here's what it looked like, as a reminder.</p>

</table>
<p>The dates are all wrong because of the pandemic, of course, and some things will never be, like the Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel (unless the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly reborn Tango Gameworks</a> acquires or licenses the IP from Microsoft), but DOOM: Year Zero could very well be the development codename for the upcoming game Dark Ages, which is indeed going to be a prequel to the DOOM franchise.</p>
<p>As for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake (or remaster, as it was listed in that leak), we haven't heard much of it for a long while. Just last week, Internet sleuth Timur222 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a Technical Artist Director from Virtuos possibly having worked on the project.</p>
<p>Today's rumor follows that thread. MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Virtuos (which worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition</a> and is helping Konami with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>) is indeed working on a remake with Epic's Unreal Engine 5. They mention having read the personal website of a former studio employee who even provided actual details on some of the gameplay improvements to six key areas: Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking was reportedly inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has been improved, too, and its damage formula has been overhauled. The stamina system was also tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen upon full stamina depletion should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (heads-up display) was modified to be more accessible as well as visually interesting. Hit reactions during combat were introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos improved Archery in a way that it would feel smoother regardless of whether the user plays in third or first-person.</p>
<p>The report does not provide any further information on the game or when it will be announced. In case you were holding up hope for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Developer Direct's mystery game</a>, it's worth reminding Microsoft explained it would be a brand new game, so it can't be a remake. Besides, the latest rumor from Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points</a> to a new installment in an established Japanese franchise with 'decades of history.'</p>
<p>Still, there's too much smoke surrounding this The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake to be false. It is likely coming, and possibly even relatively soon. It's certainly peculiar that it might be announced on the release year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the total conversion mod that aims to port Oblivion to the newer engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. When I last spoke to Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, he didn't seem too worried about it.</p>
<p>Would you be more excited about an UE5-powered official remake or for Skyblivion? Let us know in the poll and the comments below.</p>

It’ll be one without Parker ever going to Midtown Technical High School, or meeting Ned and MJ.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of 2025’s most anticipated games. It’s a direct continuation of the 2018 title that introduced Warhorse Studios’ open-world RPG universe to the wider gaming community. Like many games these days, many players are asking one question about this impending release: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 coming to Game Pass?’</p>



<p>Let’s dive into that topic and find out if this game will be released on Xbox or PC Game Pass – or both.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-be-on-game-pass">Will Kingdom Come Be On Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not be on Game Pass at launch</strong>, but it could be added to the service further down the line. In 2019, the first Kingdom Come title was added to Game Pass – but it has since been removed.</p>



<p>Those seeking to enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Xbox and PC will need to do so after paying full price for the game.</p>



<p>When Kingdom Come Deliverance was added to Game Pass all those years ago, it was still a relatively unknown, assuming title – little more than an indie release at that point. This time around, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a highly anticipated, epic title backed by a big publisher and years of development. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-being-added-to-ps-plus">Is Kingdom Come Being Added to PS Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no indication that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be added to PS Plus</strong> – it’s the same situation as the Game Pass question.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, Kingdom Come Deliverance appeared on PS Plus. It was removed a few months later at the start of 2023, just a short while before the follow-up title was announced.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 4, 2025. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you intend to buy the game when it’s out.</p>

                <p>Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 launches later this week and developer Grinding Gear has now previewed what to expect from it.. According to game director Jonathan Rogers, this patch primarily addresses issues developer Grinding Gear can address "relatively quickly," such as endgame maps and enemy balance.</p><p>You can see some of the details in a new video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile YouTube</a> channel. Endgame mapping (i.e. the autogeneration of levels) have received a balance overhaul, altering the number of chests, number of monsters, and lots of other variables. Four new "Tower" maps have been added, and the first Tower map, Lost Towers, has been redesigned to be "less boring." More endgame maps will include bosses, correcting a glitch that causes fewer bosses to spawn than intended.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNJSDxwC9bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pinnacle content has gotten some tweaks too. You'll be able to see citadels from further away in the fog of war making them easier to find. You'll also get up to six respawns for the pinnacle boss The Arbiter of Ash. The respawns can only be activated by the player who put in the keys at the Burning Monolith and they affect every player in your party at once. Respawns will be added to other Pinnacle content soon.</p><p>In other changes, lower-level unique items have gotten buffs to make them more fun to use. The patch makes effects more visible, both by removing clutter from some maps and by redesigning existing effects. Many monsters and bosses have gotten significant balance changes, such as some attacks not being triggerable when the enemy is off-screen.</p><p>Rogers noted that if a specific issue isn't discussed in this patch that does not mean that Grinding Gear is not aware of it or that it will not get addressed. You can look for the full patch notes when the patch launches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 will eventually be free-to-play,</a> but if you want to get early access, you'll have to shell out some cash.

		<p>Futurlab’s CEO Kirsty Rigden has announced that the studio will be stopping support of PowerWash Simulator VR, noting that it is costing more to continue supporting the game than it brings in. As a result the team behind PowerWash Simulator VR will be moved to other projects within the studio, to fill gaps that were being advertised. The full statement can from Kirsty can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Powerwash Simulator | VR Official Launch Trailer | Meta Quest Platform" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eu5HLdouYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Dear VR Washers,&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I am sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now. We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects. We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator VR on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team. Every time. While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position you would have made the same decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsty Rigden, CEO, Futurlab</em></p>

<p>FuturLab has made a proper go of supporting PowerWash Simulator VR, with having regularly released new content for it including the SpongeBob Squarepants and Back to the Future packs. The decision to protect jobs in an industry that has seen thousands lose their jobs, with studios shutting down at a high rate, is one that is understandable.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator VR review, Dom said, <em>“Powerwash Simulator VR is the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</em></p>

Well, years ago Valve implemented cool stuff like Steam achievements, game cards, and badges. These are great features that incentivize people to play and buy more games. However, not long after these features were added to Steam, some shady devs started creating very basic “games” that were just designed to pad achievements, give players cheap cards to trade, and increase their collection stats. So Valve came up with a solution to stop that stuff. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained by Valve via its Steam documentation website,</a></span> games arrive on Steam “limited” and missing features like trading cards. Only games that meet a certain (undisclosed) popularity and sales threshold are able to escape this limited status. The idea is that this is a quality check against shovelware and scams. And if you’re curious how many games released on Steam in 2024 are limited, well, the answer is <em>a lot</em>. </p><p>Over on LinkedIn, Twitch’s head of games Bill Young <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an interesting breakdown</a></span> of how the majority of video game releasing on Steam these days are limited. According to SteamDB, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 18,992 games were released on Steam</a></span>. But only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4,041 of those games</a></span> racked up enough sales and attracted enough players to escape limited status. That means 14,951 games launched last year on Valve’s digital PC storefront were barely played or purchased. </p><p> That 14,951 works out to 79% of all games released on Steam in 2024. And this isn’t a new trend, as pointed out by Young. In 2020, 66 percent of all games launched on Steam were limited. In 2022, that number reached 72 percent. And now, it’s up to nearly 80 percent. If you’re curious about how 2025 is going to shake out, well, we’re only 13 days into the year and 444 games have already released on Steam. 389 of them are limited.</p><p>Some might argue that Valve shouldn’t throttle or limit any of these games. But the reality is that we would likely see an increase in shovelware, scams, and asset flips if Valve completely took down the barriers it currently has in place. And I don’t think the world needs 200,000 random games suddenly flooding Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty is a series that boasts one of the most diverse multiplayer-based gaming ecosystems in the industry. From a popular battle royale game to a thriving mobile platform, Call of Duty is known and loved by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world. However, the game almost <strong>requiring </strong>an internet connection to work means that players will often run into issues. </p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to help answer one core question: ‘Is Call of Duty down?’ If it <strong>is</strong>, we’ll let you know how to get back online as soon as possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-server-status-guide">COD Server Status Guide</h2>



<p>It’s relatively simple to find out if Call of Duty is offline, whether that’s Black Ops 6, Warzone, or Call of Duty Mobile. If you’re finding that Call of Duty is down for you, you can access the following link and check out COD’s server status:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Support Server Status Page</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s typically updated in real-time, but what if Call of Duty is down for you even if that status page reflects that everything is fine from a technical standpoint?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-down-here-s-what-you-can-do">Is Call of Duty Down? Here’s What You Can Do</h2>



<p>Let’s say you’re enjoying a Call of Duty session and suddenly you find that Black Ops 6 is offline for no real reason. What do you do in that situation?</p>



<p>Firstly, you can check the status page as referenced above. It’s also a good idea to check out Down Detector, a service that allows users to report issues with games, applications, and websites. Failing that, consider jumping onto social media and running a search with a term like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Is Black Ops 6 down’</li>



<li>‘Is Call of Duty down’</li>



<li>‘Is Warzone down’</li>



<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re racking your brain for an answer, consider reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Activision Support team</a> on Twitter (X). </p>



<p>There are a few generic networking tips you can take advantage of if you’re still not finding an answer. For instance, you can try rebooting your device (a hard reset if possible), using a wired or alternate connection, rebooting your router, or taking the last-ditch action to simply wait, play something else, and come back later.</p>



<p>If Call of Duty is down at that moment, it might not be in an hour or two.</p>

<p>It appears that Konami is set to release Metal Gear Solid Delta on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 this year. This according to the leaker Nate the Hate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s been in the news</a> for his other Switch 2 reports.</p>



<p>The news comes from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest podcast</a> which also says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo will reveal</a> its Switch 2 console this week.</p>



<p>“[Other] third party games I have heard include Metal Gear Solid Delta, which is coming out in 2025,” Nate the Hate said. “Right now, it lacks a release date for all platforms, and I’m hopeful that maybe it’s a day and date release when it does come to Switch 2, because if that game, let’s say comes out in the summer of 2025, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be day and date.”</p>



<p>In addition to Metal Gear Solid Delta, Nate the Hate says that Ubisoft will be releasing a number of games on the new system. Those games reportedly include Assassins Creed Shadows, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Division, and even Rainbow Six Siege. </p>



<p>As always none of the above information has been confirmed. Until it is—or Insider Gaming can independently verify—please take it all with a grain of salt.</p>

                <p>We've known since the beginning of Chapter 6 Season 1 that we'd be getting a Godzilla skin with the battle pass in January. But it looks like this collaboration is going to be a lot bigger than you might have expected. Like, a <em>lot</em> bigger--judging by the short teaser Epic Games just dropped, there will be a skyscraper-sized Godzilla roaming the battle royale island starting this week.</p><p>It's not the most shocking news, since a Godzilla-sized Godzilla is a fairly logical thing to expect from a game that's had <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuY_X5ALrak?si=a7C69amDs0FzmKA3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">kaiju-sized monsters and mechs on the island in the past</a>, but it's cool to see the confirmation even so.</p><p>It's pretty clear, however, that there's still plenty more to this collab than we know about right now. For one thing, this collab is with Legendary Pictures for its Monsterverse franchise and last year's Godzilla x Kong--it would be pretty reasonable to expect both a King Kong skin in the item shop and a large King Kong boss on the battle royale island to battle Godzilla. And there are plenty of other potential kaiju from that franchise that could get skins, like Mechagodzilla and the Scar King.</p><p>The Godzilla skin is included with the Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass starting Jan. 17, though it will require a little bit of grinding to unlock. But, unlike in past seasons, you won't need to do any specific quests. Instead, Godzilla will be unlocked by earning XP in any experience--no need to play battle royale at all if you don't want to.</p><p>The timing of Godzilla's arrival is amusing, since this week is also bringing us the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku-themed Fortnite Festival Season 7</a>.

            <p>
There's some good news if you're been eager to sink your teeth into more Castlevania: Nocturne since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s latest animated take on the classic franchise aired in 2023. The long-promised second season finally has a release date, and arrives this Thursday, 16th January.
</p>
<p>
Castlevania: Nocturne, if you're not up to speed, follows the adventures of Maria Renard and Richter Belmont (a distant descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belndaes, who both featured heavily in Netflix's original Castlevania adaptation), with its vampiric action playing out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, circa 1792.
</p>
<p>
Season One of Castlevania: Nocturne was well received on its arrival back in September 2023, its eight-episode run wrapping up with the unexpected arrival of a familiar face. And while a second season was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-is-already-in-production">confirmed shortly after the first aired</a>, it's been a bit of a wait for its return.
</p>

<p>
Season Two, though, is just days away now, and will once again consist of eight episodes. Additionally, Powerhouse is back on animation duties, while showrunner Clive Bradley and directors Sam and Adam Deats also return. And if you're curious for a glimpse at what the team has cooked up for Castlevania: Nocturne's second season, there's two minutes and 40 seconds of teases in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlHrhysomJo">Netflix's newly shared trailer</a> above.
</p><p>
So to recap, that's Castlevania: Nocturne's second season, back this Thursday, 16th January on Netflix. Its arrival continues what's been a remarkably busy time for a franchise that hasn't had a new instalment since Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 in 2014. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-will-let-you-play-as-richter-belmont">appeared in Dead Cells</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-vampire-survival-adventure-v-rising-is-having-a-free-weekend-on-steam">popped up in V Rising</a>, and even received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-castlevania-dominus-collection-re-releases-nintendo-ds-classics">third classic games collection last August</a>, this time bundling up the series' three DS titles. Hopefully, all this is leading up to a brand-new game!

Their stories typically revolve around someone losing their humanity and sense of self, becoming driven solely by primal instincts to kill—often those they love the most—and death so often seems to be the only way to lift the curse. Or, you know, sometimes it’s about a basketball-playing teenager.</p><p>While werewolf movies may not hold quite the same cultural reverence or popularity as other paranormal entities, there are still some great examples out there that define the genre. With Leigh Whannell’s upcoming remake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170"><em>The Wolfman</em></a></span>—following his success with another Universal Studios monster movie remake, <em>The Invisible Man</em>—it feels like the perfect moment to revisit the lycanthrope canon.</p></div></div><div><p>A secluded and idyllic retirement community is rocked by deadly attacks, and it’s up to one of the residents—a blind, weather-worn veteran superbly played by Nick Damici—to lead the charge in defeating the hairy, bloodthirsty fiends. While <em>Late Phases</em> delivers plenty of gore, it lingers too much on the family drama without delivering enough scares, made worse by the special effects, which, while ambitious for a smaller indie film and admirably practical, lack realism. However, <em>Late Phases</em> does offer some thoughtful commentary on how the elderly are forgotten and neglected by society—even by their own family members.</p></div><div><p><em>Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf</em> is a playful and family-friendly take on werewolves. The attention-grabbing title refers to Shaggy, who is turned into a werewolf by Dracula, no less, and has to reverse the curse by winning a monster road rally. It’s a funny concept because poor Shaggy is the last person that wants to have his routine of eating good snacks interrupted by becoming the type of monster he’s always scared of! I was obsessed with this movie as a kid and it still holds up today, offering a lot of clever gags and wacky shenanigans where the gang isn’t focused on solving a mystery but more on helping Shaggy break free from his hairy predicament. </p></div><div><p>The 1957 film<em> I Was a Teenage Werewolf</em> popularized the trope of the werewolf transformation as an allegory for puberty, self-discovery, and the loss of innocence during adolescence. <em>Teen Wolf</em> embraces this idea with ‘80s-style goofy antics. If you’re looking for a werewolf movie that’s less horror and more lighthearted fare, you can’t do better than <em>Teen Wolf</em>, which features the teenage lycanthrope surfing on top of a van to The Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ U.S.A.” Scott’s transformation leads him to become more popular, attract girls, and, somewhat inexplicably, excel at basketball. Thanks to Michael J. Fox’s boyish charm, the movie remains fun to watch, even as its silliness occasionally veers into stupidity.</p></div><div><p>Released the same year as the far superior <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, <em>The Howling</em> also boasts impressive special effects, but it straddles the line between camp and horror with less finesse. Directed by <em>Gremlins</em>’ Joe Dante, this satirical take on cults and media sensationalism follows a television journalist (Dee Wallace) who, after helping the police catch a serial killer, is sent to a psychiatric retreat for recovery. Karen discovers there’s something more—and possibly supernatural—to the story. </p><p>The makeup and special effects, initially handled by Rick Baker before he left to work on <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, were taken over by Rob Bottin. They are impressive, especially the formation of the protruding snout. However, some aspects like the bubbling in his face, enter silly territory, even with the unsettling bone cracking sounds. The constant cutting back and forth to Karen doesn’t help, either, because it takes so long for the scene to unfold that the transformation ends up being boring rather than scary. Still, <em>The Howling</em> remains an enjoyable, quintessentially ‘80s werewolf movie.</p></div><div><p>Amy Adams delivers yet another awards-worthy performance in <em>Nightbitch</em>, a feminist, quasi-werewolf film that highlights everything wrong with modern motherhood—the pressures of losing your identity, feelings of isolation, and little societal support. <em>Nightbitch</em> addresses these real-life issues with honest empathy and the supernatural elements with more absurdity. Nevertheless, it’s refreshing to see a werewolf movie that uses the metaphor in an entirely different way. The stay-at-home mom’s nightly transformations make sense because motherhood can become all about control and maintaining a perfect image, when what you really want is to release your rage and the intensity of your feelings. <em>Nightbitch </em>transforms the werewolf myth into something more contemporary and relatable—not just stories of tragic male heroes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolfman </em>had a lot of production problems, including a change in director, a new composer, re-shoots, budget inflation, all pushing back production schedules, and even faced cuts to reduce graphic content. But in the end, Joe Johnston’s retelling of <em>The Wolfman</em> is a Gothic thrill ride with lacerating violence and a brooding central performance from Bencio del Toro. He gives anguished layers to Lawrence Talbot, who travels to his ancestral home of Blackmoor in search for his missing brother only to become part of a supernatural family curse after being bitten by a werewolf. </p><p>While the film teeters between Rick Baker’s incredible makeup work and some shoddy CGI, the transformation and kill scenes are a thrilling mix of frightening and gory fun. The 1800s setting adds to the Gothic mystique, perfectly suited for an epic climax in aristocratic London, a time when legends and folklore were often considered closer to truth than fiction.</p></div><div><p>A podunk Utah town is shaken by a series of mysterious deaths that happen after each full moon. Writer, director, and star Jim Cummings once again proves he’s one of the best independent filmmakers out there, masterfully merging quirky dark comedy with grisly mystery and mischief. <em>The Wolf of Snow Hollow </em>is more than just a blood-soaked werewolf movie; it’s also a compelling character study, with Cummings playing a self-destructive alcoholic, and a touching father-son story, with the great Robert Forster playing his father. The film’s take on toxic masculinity is perfectly suited for a werewolf mythology about someone (mainly men) turning into the wildest version of themselves, driven by pure aggression, violence, and unbridled desire.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolf Man</em> is a must-see classic that set the standard for werewolf cinema. The stark black-and-white cinematography, combined with forest landscapes cloaked in mist and images of fortune tellers and tarot cards, all work together to create an atmosphere of Gothic horror. Actor Lon Chaney Jr. was no stranger to monster movies, having played The Frankenstein Monster, The Mummy, and The Invisible Man, but there’s something about his portrayal of Larry Talbot-turned-Wolf Man that feels more somber. He brings to life a tortured soul unwittingly possessed by a savage creature. The makeup by Jack Pierce highlights his humanity, even in his animalistic form, which makes his curse all the more horrifying—as if he’s doomed to live in limbo, never fully belonging to either world. This also makes the tragic ending feel all the more poignant.</p></div><div><p>Female werewolves are not as common in horror, but <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is one of the few films that smartly pairs the supernatural curse with another real-life “curse” that most young women undergo: getting their first period. The story follows a pair of outcast sisters with a taste for the macabre and a desire to escape the mundanity of suburbia. After Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is bitten by a dog, she goes through odd changes, becoming more aggressive, hypersexual, and menstruating heavily. </p><p><em>Ginger Snaps</em> skillfully interweaves themes of girlhood with lycanthropic folklore, such as questioning whether a silver navel piercing can offer a cure or seeking animalistic revenge on the cruel, bullying popular girls. With its feminist edge, <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is a sharp and wickedly funny take on teenage humiliation, not only a fierce werewolf film but also a great coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>There’s no other werewolf movie quite like John Landis’<em> An American Werewolf in London</em>. American tourists David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are attacked by a werewolf after the locals warn them, “Beware the moon.” After Jack’s death, David is plagued by gruesome, surreal nightmares and eventually undergoes a terrifying transformation. The film brilliantly balances jet-black comedy—where ghosts tell David with a cheerful smile, “just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger”—with disturbing body horror. The transformation scene featuring the iconic work of makeup artist Rick Baker puts any other werewolf movie to shame. </p><p>The use of his incredible prosthetics makes the scene feel more real, tangible, and frightening. The way David lies on the floor with his newly hair-covered, animal-like hind legs twitching, and lets out a horrified screen—it is absolutely haunting. His bloodthirsty rampage across London culminates in one of the most ironic and hilarious music cue/smash cut combinations ever. <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> remains the ultimate werewolf movie—both tragic and darkly hilarious.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ahead of the February 27 release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom is hosting an open beta, allowing anyone to access and test the gameplay features in early February before launch. You don’t have to sign up and hope for a chance to gain access; everyone can download the beta client and play upon its release. Here’s everything you need to know about the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta 2, including how to join, the dates, and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-the-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">How to Access the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta</h2>



<p>If you want to test out Monster Hunter Wilds a few weeks early, download the open beta file from Steam, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S via each system’s storefront. It’s completely free, though you should expect a sizable download.</p>



<p>The open beta file is not yet available to download as of this writing. It will become available to everyone closer to the start date, as listed below, for the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta period.</p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-dates">Monster Hunter Wilds Beta Dates</h2>



<p>This next open beta period is broken into two phases:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: February 6 – February 9
<ul>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: 7 pm PT / 6 pm CT / 10 pm ET</li>



<li><strong>End</strong>: 6:59 pm PT / 8:59 pm CT / 9:59 pm ET</li>

<h2 id="h-what-does-the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-include">What Does the Monster Hunter Wilds Beta Include?</h2>



<p>If you participated in the game’s first open beta test in November, you should know precisely what to expect from this testing phase, as it’s the same. February’s open beta includes Character Creation, Story Trial, and a few monster hunts, including the all-new Gypceros Hunt.</p>



<p>And yes, any character you create during the character creation process in the open beta does transfer to the main game upon release at the end of February. However, progress does not carry over, so don’t get too attached to any weapons, armor, or abilities you unlock during the testing phase. They won’t stick around.</p>

new battle pass to level up. Activision hasn't revealed the details of the pass, but that information will likely be released closer to launch.</p><p dir="ltr">If Season 2 follows past Call of Duty seasons, the update will likely include new maps, modes, seasonal challenges, and more DLC weapons to unlock. Season 1 Reloaded is wrapping up with the ongoing Squid Game event, and it's possible that Season 2 will also have limited-time events and IP crossovers.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Anti_cheat_updates">Anti-cheat updates</h2><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ranked Play modes for multiplayer and Warzone are infested with cheaters, and Activision has acknowledged that there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-devs-say-ricochet-anti-cheating-measures-did-not-hit-the-mark/1100-6528554/">some problems with Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat system</a>. The publisher also revealed that there are major upgrades to Ricochet that will be launching with Season 2 and 3, so hopefully those updates will finally oust the hackers in both games.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><p dir="ltr">While we don't have any specific announcements for multiplayer, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes-revert-some-of-last-weeks-changes/1100-6528739/">January 9 patch notes</a> for Black Ops 6 revealed a few anticipated fixes scheduled for Season 2 of Zombies. This includes an update to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic on the Terminus map again, which will revert the change made that patched this method in the January 3 update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 2 update should also provide a proper fix for the frustrating Vermin double-attack bug, which was previously listed as being fixed in recent patch notes, but the problem persisted for players. The developer commented on the issue by saying, "Sometimes bugs appear fixed in testing but turn out to still be an issue in the live game after the patch goes out. This sucks for everyone involved, and it can lead to inaccurate patch notes, which we never want."</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies received the Citadelle des Morts map in Season 1, and while it's uncertain if another new map will arrive for Season 2, we do have story teasers that point to the next map being an excavation site in France. The setting and location sound very similar to the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2, which took place at Excavation Site 64 in Northern France.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Details for this next season of battle royale haven't been revealed yet, but in addition to anti-cheat improvements, Season 2 will likely include new modes, events, and game improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Verdansk map is set to return in the springtime, which an insider has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/verdansk-could-return-to-call-of-duty-warzone-in-season-3/1100-6528765/">leaked to potentially be the Season 3 update</a> for Warzone.</p>

                <p>Developer FuturLab has announced that it is ending support for PowerWash Simulator VR due to its dwindling financial viability. However, the studio has seemingly avoided layoffs since the VR team has been moved to other projects.</p><p>"We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects," CEO Kristy Rigden explained in a statement.</p><p>She said that she prioritized job security for her team, so she filled those other roles and projects with members from the VR team.</p><p>Rigden also explained that while general VR support is currently winding down, that doesn't mean that the FuturLab won't support the platform in the future. The studio clarified that the VR game and currently released DLC are still purchasable and playable, but it will not receive any future updates.</p><p>The VR space has seen some challenges over the past few years.

            <p>Destiny creators Bungie are reportedly making a team-based MOBA that takes hefty inspiration from Nintendo's Smash Bros series. Or rather, they were. Codenamed Gummy Bears, the project is now apparently in the hands of another, newly founded PlayStation studio, with 40 Bungie developers sticking around to work on it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, who cite anonymous sources, the new Sony studio in question is the one founded last year when Bungie (who are owned by Sony) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">announced major restructuring</a>. Consisting of 155 people, the new studio were said back then to be working on an untitled "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe".</p>
<p>The Gummy Bear project is described as "vibrant", "colourful", "lo-fi", and "cosy". Perhaps needless to say, it's designed for a younger audience. The Game Post's sources claim it's been in development for three years, and uses a percentage-based damage system, where blows knock back characters further and further, rather than traditional health bars. Which is very Smash Bros.</p>
<p>It's also said to have three class types - support, attack and defence - and a bunch of modes, with the ability to hang out with people between matches. Which I guess implies that there's a hub environment of some kind. Less excited about that stuff. I hate hanging out. Leave me alone.</p><p>Bungie's known projects include the Destiny series and a reboot of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> - aged cousin of DOOM turned PvP extraction shooter. Bitter old farts like myself and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">Brendy</a> do not think much of nu-Marathon, whose workings remain a mystery almost two years on from announcement. But galloping guides editor Ollie is rather more optimistic. In our round-up of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">2025's most anticipated games</a>, he comments that "I adore extraction shooters, and despite the continued dominance of Tarkov and Hunt, Bungie has the potential to create the genre's new frontrunner".</p>
<p>Me, I'd rather play a Bungie Smash Bros homage. I mean, Bungie are the people who invented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zejmZGaonLY">the Gravity Hammer</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has completely broken matchmaking, with players reporting they cannot get into the game.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Activision has yet to offer an update or patch notes for both Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but currently, no one is seemingly able to play the game.</p>



<p>But don’t worry; the Call of Duty store works fine if you’re planning to spend some of your hard-earned cash.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://mobile.x.com/CODUpdates/status/1878856625920065848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates</a> X account, the current issues are a result of the update being distributed to everyone. </p>



<p>The latest patch update is Call of Duty Black Ops 6’s and Warzone’s first update since the Call of Duty development teams took leave for the holidays. As for what exactly the patch entailed, it remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been under fire in recent weeks due to the game’s massive number of bugs, inaccurate bans, and hackers, which has seen the game lose players on mass over the holiday period. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game lost 38.9 of its Steam player base in December, the highest percentage lost during this period in the past few years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SteamDB shows a further 20.8% loss during the past 30 days. Today’s news for Call of Duty keeps on getting worse, as earlier in the day, one leaker reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk will be returning during Season 3</a> rather than Season 2.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Call of Duty’s latest blunders? Let us know down in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>According to new information revealed by a known leaker, Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed this week with a new trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0fwdx/natethehate_nintendo_switch_2_will_be_revealed_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Nate the Hate has released a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> titled “Nintendo 2025 Predictions”. In it, he discusses when the Switch 2 will be revealed, what kind of support it will get, and other details. In the video, Nate states, “The Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week.” He has been told that the Switch 2 announcement trailer will arrive on Thursday, January 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate added that the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal will “focus almost exclusively on the console itself”. The reveal will not have any games present unless a game is shown “running on the screen”, depending on how the trailer comes out. He has explicitly stated that “software is not going to be a focus”, so players shouldn’t be “too surprised” if no games are revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate elaborated that this week’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer might only showcase the system, its functionality, the new logo, and maybe some packaging. He’s heard that a separate software showcase for Switch 2 games will be scheduled for late February or early March, where we might see new Nintendo games and third-party titles.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Starfield was originally planned to have a gore and dismemberment system like Fallout, with players being able to more gruesomely kill foes. However, these features were ultimately left out of Starfield.</p><p>In an interview with Kiwi Talkz, former senior character artist Dennis Mejillones said that there were technical considerations when it came to the space suits. "There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off; you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is," he explained. "We had systems for all of that, and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for."</p><p>With the feature of being able to customize body size in the character creator, that added more complications. Mejillones also said that gore and dismemberment didn't fit with Starfield's themes as opposed to Fallout's over-the-top presentation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2697">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ebSmOGZnmeM?start=2697" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk where you can make a mess out of something and blow up? It's part of the fun," he explained.</p><p>He added that Starfield was meant to be more realistic, so gore and dismemberment didn't fit in thematically. With the technical costs factored in, it was decided that gore would be scrapped from the game.</p><p>Other former Starfield developers have shared their thoughts on the game and the industry at large. One said that they were surprised at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-starfield-dev-surprised-by-the-number-of-loading-screens-it-could-have-existed-without-those/1100-6528530/" data-ref-id="1100-6528530">number of loading screens</a> Starfield had, and another Bethesda veteran said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-veteran-says-players-are-fatigued-by-seemingly-endless-games/1100-6528653/" data-ref-id="1100-6528653">players are fatigued by long games</a>.</p><p>Starfield is currently on PC and Xbox Series X|S.
