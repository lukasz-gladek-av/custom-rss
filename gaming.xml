		<p>DreadXP and developer Cara Cadaver have announced that VILE: Exhumed is being released as a free shareware title, after the game got caught up in Steam’s mass banning of games due to payment processors refusing to allow people to buy certain games. It was banned for “sexual content with depictions of real people,” even though the game does not contain any of this. Instead, the game is about the developer’s own experience stalking and violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="VILE: EXHUMED | VILEISBANNED.COM" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6lOV2KN_Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cara Cadaver said,<em> “This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. This is our response to being censored, and our rejection of the idea that horror can be defined as acceptable or not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As soon as we realized that the game had been banned, the conversation internally with Cara became about what we collectively could do to do right by her and her work. In the face of widespread attempted censorship, it didn’t feel like a time for half-measures and compromise, so we all decided that releasing the game into the wild where it could never be made unavailable by a single platform felt like the best option, and strongest message.”</em> said DreadXP Director, Hunter Bond.</p>

<p>VILE: Exhumed is available to purchase from the website <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">Vile Is Banned,</a> from where users can download the game for free or choose to donate funds. Cara has said that 50% of all profits will be donated to the charity Red Door Family Shelter, which is based in Toronto and helps families, refugees, and women who are getting out of violent situations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-adds-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-rain-world-and-more.1262763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft announced the Game Pass lineup for August. The highlight of the lineup is undoubtedly Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will be available starting on Thursday, August 7.</p>



<p>The game, released in late 2023, was originally meant to be an expansion to Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but Ubisoft later decided to make it a standalone title, albeit one that was not an open world action RPG like most of the latest titles in the franchise. Assassin's Creed Mirage was well-received by critics and fans. As to the former, here's an excerpt of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 8/10 review of the game</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign, and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>



<p>There are rumors that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be getting a DLC</a> funded by the Savvy Games Group, but there's no confirmation for the time being. Even if that turns out to be true, you'd have to pay it separately from the Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage, the following games are being added to Microsoft's subscription service this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rain World (already available through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>MechWarrior 5: Clans (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (available via Xbox Series X|S starting August 6, now on GP Standard)</li>



<li>Aliens: Fireteam Elite (available via cloud, console, and PC starting on August 12 for Game Pass Ultimate, PC GP, and GP Standard)</li>



<li>9 Kings (available via Game Preview on PC via August 14 for Game Pass Ultimate and PC GP)</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980">President Trump</a> was spotted earlier today wandering around on the roof of the White House. It wasn’t immediately clear why. He might have been surveying the nearby grounds for his proposed $200 million ballroom building that would be nearly twice the size of the White House itself. Or maybe the purported leader of the free world, having recently suffered a string of self-inflicted owns, was simply losing it.</p> <p>The latest sign we are deeply cooked as a nation came as the White House press pool berated the 79-year-old <a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-verdict-guilty-hush-money-trial-phoenix-wright-1851510635">convicted felon</a> with important questions ranging from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/donald-trump-mental-fitness">What are you doing up there?</a>” to “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/gaza-american-democracy-test/">Do you approve of Netanyahu taking over all of Gaza?</a>” At some point Trump was asked what he was trying to build. He tried to shout something incomprehensible about nuclear missiles in response. He pointed up at the sky. Welcome to the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>The contradictions continue to heighten. Who among us can turn away? Each new day presents the American people with some fresh and often morally abominable stupidity to leer at:</p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN">https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN</a> <a href="https://t.co/k099T14SIs">pic.twitter.com/k099T14SIs</a></p> <p>— Jéferfon Menezes (@JefinhoMenes) <a href="https://twitter.com/JefinhoMenes/status/1952751166577623068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>It’s possible the rooftop stroll is evidence of a man losing his grip not just on reality but on his poll numbers too. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/polling-tariffs-trump-analysis">Trump’s agenda</a>–lawless ICE arrests, tax cuts for the rich, tariffs for everyone else–is underwater with nearly every slice of the public. The Epstein files remain MIA even as questions mount, much to his base’s disbelief. Amid all this winning is one crazy gambit after another, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/nasa-china-space-station-duffy-directives-00492172">including building a nuclear reactor on the moon</a>.</p> <p>Where will Trump pop up next? Will he return to the golf course to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-golf-score-cheating-bedminster-b2801223.html">get creative again</a> with his sandtrap ball placement? Will he go back to a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds-visit/">marveling at the fry grill at McDonalds</a>? He has a Twitch streamer’s knack for marrying the faux-improv of manufactured reality TV with genuinely unpredictable WTF moments. Pay no attention to the fact that the price of things like ground beef (and the original Switch) <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112">just hit record highs</a>.</p>

                <p>The makers of an upcoming spaceship co-op title are making a slight change of course: The game formerly known as Jump Ship has been renamed to Jump Space.</p><p>Development studio Keepsake Games announced the name change in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a>, assuring readers that the rebranding does not affect the game's release plans, and adding that a date announcement for its early access launch is coming this month at Gamescom. The title's Steam listing currently displays a release window of Q3 2025.</p><p>The studio, which was formed by veterans from Mojang, Hazelight Studios, and Coffee Stain Studios, stated that the new name is the result of "trademark complications." Keepsake's post does not go into detail about the complications. "Jump ship" is a fairly common idiom, but any company or product sharing the name could be the reason for a trademark dispute.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨IMPORTANT NEWS!🚨<br>We're renaming to Jump Space, due to trademark complications.<br>This does not affect our release plans -<br>In fact, RELEASE DATE REVEAL at Gamescom later this August! <a href="https://t.co/x2iouYlvmV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/x2iouYlvmV</a></p>  — Jump Space - formerly Jump Ship (@KeepsakeGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Keepsake expressed excitement for the name change. "We think Jump Space is super cool, after all, there is more to the game than just the Ship," the Steam post continues. Funnily enough, this isn't the first name change for the game, as it previously<a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1663878368696193031" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> went by the codename Hyperspace</a> before a formal reveal as Jump Ship in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-looks-like-ftl-combined-with-sea-of-thieves/1100-6522368/" data-ref-id="1100-6522368">Jump Space has four players</a> act as crew members on a spacefaring craft, taking on several "hand crafted missions with random elements." Players will switch between operating and maintaining the ship, space walking, and exploring planets on foot.</p><p>Common points of comparison to Jump Space include Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, and it joins the budding "space Sea of Thieves-like" subgenre alongside Void Crew and Wildgate. However, Jump Space is purely a PvE experience, bringing it closer to Void Crew and less like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-space-pvp-game-wildgate-will-be-supported-after-launch/1100-6533150/" data-ref-id="1100-6533150">PvP-focused Wildgate</a>.</p><p>According to Keepsake Games, over 1 million people have added Jump Space to their Steam wishlist. The game is running a closed beta, and a free demo was available for a limited time this past June as a part of Steam Next Fest. Keepsake says that the Next Fest demo reached over 500,000 players.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo.1262745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
RTA, Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event, has confirmed there'll be no Nintendo games present at this year's show due to Nintendo's strict rules around the use of its products.
</p>
<p>
This year's RTA in Japan marathon runs from 9th-15th August, and promises dozen of speedruns throughout the week, with all proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders. Its <a href="https://horaro.org/rtaij/rtaijs2025">lengthy 2025 schedule</a> includes everything from Minecraft and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cuphead">Cuphead</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, but organisers confirmed several months ago that Nintendo games would not be included at this year's event - and they've now explained why.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">statement shared on the RTA website</a> (as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">translated by Automaton</a>), organisers say they were contacted by Nintendo on 13th June and told that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" to feature the company's games. Not only that, RTA was informed their previous streams constituted "unauthorised use". It seems Nintendo expects RTA to apply for permission to feature its titles on a game-by-game basis, but the complexity of the task meant it wasn't practical to do so in time for this year's show.
</p>
<p>
However, organisers have expressed hope of including Nintendo titles in future speedrunning events and are currently negotiating with the company.
</p>

Nintendo has, of course, long sought to control third-parties' ability to utilise its games, particularly where streaming is concerned. While some might see YouTube fan videos and similar community content as an opportunity for free promotion, Nintendo has historically deemed such activities as copyright infringement, even going as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-claiming-ad-revenue-for-youtube-lets-play-videos">demand all ad revenue</a> for streaming at one time. And while the company's stance has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-scraps-creators-program-making-life-much-easier-for-youtubers">softened somewhat over the years</a>, stories sporadically emerge highlighting its strict - if not <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youtubes-updated-violence-and-profanity-restrictions-can-retroactively-restrict-gaming-videos">outright draconian</a> - rules where third-parties usage is concerned.
</p>
<p>
Memorably, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-addresses-controversial-smash-world-tour-fan-competition-closure-in-lengthy-statement">accused of trying to halt the Smash World Tour Championship in 2022</a> after it refused to grant a license to competition organisers.

		<p>Nintendo has announced an Indie World Nintendo Direct stream will be taking place on Thursday, 7th August.</p>
<p>The stream will kick off at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 9AM EDT / 6AM PDT) and will run for a tight 15 minutes with a blend of announcements and updates on games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTv0HmKoUqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It follows on from the partner showcase last week, which was stuffed with a whole host of announcements like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-with-its-first-action-packed-trailer/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-a-hd-2d-prequel-coming-to-switch-switch-2-this-year/">Octopatch Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot</a>. In hindsight, there were next to no indie games included in that stream, leaving some big open goals for this Indie World stream to shoot for.</p>
<p>There’s a number of key indie titles that are expected for Switch that could make an appearance here, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-2">Hades 2</a> which is set to be a console exclusive, or the very, very highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if everyone’s wishes are fulfilled!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Elves 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e2aeec6c8205/elves-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">Elves 2 Pro</a>, accessory manufacturer Gulikit is back with the, uh, <strong>Elves 2</strong>. Yes, this is a cheaper model (<strong>$29.99 / £29.99</strong>) of the Saturn-inspired wireless pad for the Switch and Switch 2; one that shirks some of the more advanced customisation options of its slightly elder sibling while adding in one rather enticing new feature.</p>
<p>If you happen to own a Switch 2 and are eagerly awaiting a third-party controller that includes wake-up support for Nintendo’s new hardware, the wait is over. The Elves 2 is officially the first to include the feature, and I’m happy to confirm that it works exactly as you’d expect.</p>
<p>After pairing the pad by holding down the sync button in the ‘Change Grip/Order’ settings menu, you can then simply hold down the ‘Home’ button on the Elves 2 to wake up the Switch 2 from sleep mode. It’s a small thing, but it’s something that immediately makes Gulikit’s new product instantly more appealing than most options on the market.</p>

<p>So that’s all well and good, but what’s been stripped out to make the pad cheaper than the Elves 2 Pro? Well, perhaps the most notable exclusion for me was the distinct rumble modes found on the Pro. Here, you’ve just got three levels of standard rumble intensity within dual-rotor vibration motors, so you’re missing out on the ‘HD Rumble’ and ‘Super Haptic’ modes featured in the Pro. It still feels pretty good, mind you, but moving directly from the Pro to the Elves 2 yields a noticeable downgrade.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, while you can remap buttons, adjust thumbstick sensitivity, toggle between 4-way and 8-way d-pad directional modes, and utilise APG macro recording on the Pro, none of these are available on the Elves 2. Okay, the latter might not be particularly relevant for many users, but remapping the button layout can prove exceedingly useful, so to see it missing here is a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>But enough about what’s not included. What you <em>do</em> get with the Elves 2 is the all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with replaceable caps. It seems almost quaint to highlight this as a specific feature these days, but hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">Nintendo itself still hasn’t got this covered just yet</a>. You’ve also got a Turbo mode, a capture button, gyro, and 20 hours of playtime on a single 2-hour charge. Not too shabby.</p>

<p>Sadly, NFC and GameChat support are not included, as with the Pro, with the latter being particularly noteworthy given the addition of wake-up support. Indeed, it feels like the Elves 2 took one baby-step toward being a must-buy Switch 2 pad, but forgot to take a few more steps in the process.</p>
<p>Still, for day-to-day use, you could do a lot worse. Design-wise, it’s identical to the Pro, taking inspiration from the Sega Saturn, but opting for a more traditional 4-button layout – sorry, 6-button fans. Despite being the same size, mind you, the loss of certain features means the pad is also slightly lighter than the Pro, weighing in at 170g versus 190g. It still feels nice in the hands, but there’s definitely a sense that it’s not quite as ‘solid’ as the Pro, if that makes sense. Almost like the majority of the interior is hollow.</p>
<p>As for the colour options, you’ve got Translucent Black, which looks absolutely lovely (though picks up dust like a bugger, hence the lack of photos here). You could almost mistake it as a solid black, but you can just about see the innards through the grips, and this is especially noticeable when held up against the light. Subtle, elegant... <em>nice</em>.</p>

<p>The other option is Coral Red, and let’s be honest, Gulikit could have just called it Pink and be done with it. It’s pink. There are lots of pink accessories that I’m rather fond of, but this isn’t one of them. It might be the combination of the pink casing and the white buttons/sticks, but it looks a little bit cheap when compared to the black model. And it’s got nothing on the ‘Retro’ Pro variant, either – that one is an absolute banger.</p>
<p>A decent controller, then, but unless you're absolutely dead-set on having the wake-up support for the Switch 2, I'd probably recommend spending that little bit more for the more feature-rich (and attractive) Elves 2 Pro.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab have taken issue with an imitation of their game created in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">100% non-problematic</a> kiddy funhouse sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, saying that they'd prefer people pirate their creation than play its predatory WonkoVision double.

</p><!--more-->
<p>

"tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff," reads <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">the social media post in question</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Roblox imitation is called Cliff, and is the work of PewStudio, who do acknowledge Peak as an inspiration on the store page, with the nonchalance of cereal manufacturers letting you know that your breakfast may contain a non-zero quantity of paperclips. As explored by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">Eurogamer</a>, everything from the title art through the lobby area to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">the co-op clambering mechanics</a> is flagrantly redolent of the Aggro Crab hit. The major difference is that it looks relatively naff and is thickly garnished with microtransactions.
</p>
<p>
I can understand Aggro Crab's ire, though I do enjoy the vague deference of naming the clone for a geological formation you'd expect to find lower down the mountainside. I mean, they could have called it Summit. I also have a guilty affection for the uncanny aesthetics of such cash-grab knock-offs. I always drink plenty of... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovfM7dvFto0">malk</a>?
</p>
<p>
Roblox teems with clones. If you have made a successful video game, its ruined double doubtless exists somewhere in the Roblands. For some developers this is a serious barrier to prosperity, and for others, it is an irritation. Peak has sold over <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/how-peak-sold-45m-copies-in-less">4.5 million copies</a> as of July - I can't imagine either Roblox clones or cathartic/vengeful piracy will make much difference to Aggro Crab's finances at this stage. If you're a Peak player, by the way, you might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">these skeletons</a>.

              <p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543360749096928012?l=english">update posted a few weeks back by the creative director of Soulslike <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> Junho Lee–<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/would-you-rather-stop-playing-a-game-than-lower-the-difficulty-the-first-berserker-khazan-devs-reckon-you-would">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> today</a>–reveals the astonishing fact that the action game’s players would rather give up and stop playing than switch to Easy mode. I am here today to address these people: Oh my goodness, pull yourself together.</p> <p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em><em>&nbsp;</em>released in March 2025, and while it never took off in the way of some Soulslikes, it found its audience. <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917">Ethan had a decent time with</a> its mix of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls </em>and <em>God of War</em>, and at the time reported that its “easy” mode was a refreshing break during frustrating difficulty spikes. In fact, he went on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/khazan-first-berserker-easy-mode-difficulty-soulslike-1851773051">write another article describing the easy mode as “an excellent lifeline,”</a> explaining that the option in no way spoiled the core of the game. “You will die less often on easy mode,” he noted, “but you will most definitely still die, and probably still a lot.” The mode doesn’t just turn the player into an attack sponge who can walk through the bosses, but instead tweaks health levels and stamina recovery, reducing the degree of difficulty when it comes to balancing your ability to attack against the need to stagger enemies. In other words, it allows a player who’s having a tough time to have a bit more room to play. “You get more chances to experiment, practice, and learn from your mistakes,” said Ethan at the time.</p> <p>Sounds good, right? Except, no, because there’s a wretched virus out there that causes people to believe that being able to lower difficulty is worse than not being able to carry on playing the game they paid for.</p>

 <p>According to Junho Lee’s update in late June, “We figured that if players found the game too difficult, they’d simply switch to Easy. But when we looked at the data, we saw that many players just quit the game without ever changing the difficulty.”</p> <p>And why? “When we asked why, a lot of people said, “I’d rather quit with dignity than drop it down to Easy.”</p> <p>What have we done? How badly screwed is our society that there are large numbers of people who, in the privacy of their own home with no one watching, would rather not play a game at all than make it easier? How fucked up are our perceptions of bravado that people pick total defeat over slightly altering a game to suit their own needs? Because if someone’s giving up, <em>the game was too hard for them</em>. How is abandoning it entirely perceived as somehow less of an emasculating failure? How do we fix this?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614683">©Neople</figcaption></figure> <p>Soulslikes might not be for me, but I fully appreciate what an extraordinary and massively entertaining format they are. I love reading stories about those people who are somehow able to complete them using, I dunno, DK Bongos played with electric drills held in their feet. I look at those people with awe, fully aware they are enormously more skilled in this area than I could ever be, but with no compulsion to want to try. (I’m still feeling smug that I beat the final boss in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> first time–that’s my level.) But at the same time, Soulslikes have also concentrated some of the very worst of gaming culture into the purest, titrated drip. It’s become “git gud” as a religion. So much so that even in complete privacy, people are unwilling to enjoy the game they spent their money on.</p> <p>Junho Lee has the most pragmatic take on difficulty. “Difficulty is subjective,” he notes, “and each player experiences <em>Khazan</em>‘s challenges differently. That’s why we offered multiple difficulty options from the start.” Right? That makes sense, yes? I’m actually asking, because apparently the answer is “no” for an awful lot of people. Lee continues, “We wanted more people to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Khazan</em>, and we thought it would be better to let players freely adjust the challenge. We thought it was up to the player to lower it if it’s too hard, or raise it if it’s too easy.”</p>

 <p>As if this situation weren’t already farcical,&nbsp;<em>Khazan</em> developers Neople addressed this issue by…changing the name of the “Easy” option to “Normal.” The previous “Normal” was upgraded to “Challenge.” And then they set the game to default to the new Normal. Problem solved.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614684">©Neople</figcaption></figure> <p>This sense of pride, this notion that if you play a game on “Easy” you’re in some way inadequate, is insidious and desperately sad. As a games critic, I play all games I’m covering for work on their default setting, usually “Normal.” That seems reasonable, and if during the course of playing the game I discover it’s impossibly difficult, or far too easy, I’ll report this in my coverage. If it’s so hard I can’t get anywhere at all, I’ll report that too, but then switch the difficulty down so I can at least see the game. But in my own time, on my own clock, I’ll pick whatever feels right! Sometimes I love to return to a game I original played on Normal and see it through again on Easy, enjoying the atmosphere instead of the challenge. Other times I’ll push something up to a harder setting and see what I’m capable of. Most of the time, though, I’ll just set it to match what skill level feels comfortable, and feel no shame about whatever that may be. Not least because literally no one else will ever know. Nor indeed have any sensible reason to care!</p>

 <p>It’s worth noting that at the same time as it implemented these changes in nomenclature, Neople also added a Beginner and a Hardcore mode, opening the game up to those who are new to Soulslikes and also don’t have an ego as fragile as an antique vase, as well as people who are super-good at this sort of game and want even more challenge. Fun fact: neither mode causes you to become a better person.</p> <p>The topic of difficulty is obviously a fraught one, thanks to the most aggressive denizens of the online gaming world. Responses to articles <a href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231">suggesting that more options welcome in a wider audience</a> tend to be deeply vitriolic as well as histrionic, furious attempts at gatekeeping disguised as nonsense arguments about “developer vision” and “harming games.” It seems that those behind such walls of noise would prefer to entirely give up on a game than question their beliefs.</p>

 <p>Listen: if you’re playing a game and it’s far too hard and you can’t get anywhere, just turn the difficulty down. If the game’s well-designed, it’ll play a lot more satisfactorily now. Perhaps through playing this way, you’ll get the hang of the mechanics enough to put that difficulty back up again in a bit. Perhaps this mode, whatever its name might be, just happens to match your personal skill levels. Much like, say, if you wanted to have a game of basketball, you might not have a very enjoyable time being endlessly thrashed by members of your local college team. But you don’t respond to this by giving up on basketball as a concept–you just find people of a similar skill level to your own. It’s normal human behavior.</p> <p>There’s something so unbearably tragic about a developer realizing its audience is so bruised and fragile that it needs to change “Easy” to “Normal” to have many of them play it. It speaks so poorly of gaming society at large, grimly describing a culture of toxicity and cruelty. If you’re surrounded by people who make you feel so bad about difficulty levels that you’d sooner give up on a thing you’ve bought out of misguided pride than make it more accessible for yourself, then perhaps the people surrounding you aren’t so great? Perhaps there are better, kinder people you could have in your life, who not only wouldn’t judge you for this, but wouldn’t even think to care about it at all.</p>

                <p>Introduced in Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_Portal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portal</a> is a mode that allows players to create custom game modes, and for Battlefield 6, it's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609"> getting a big overhaul</a>. UX director Alan Pimm said in a new interview that Battlefield Studios is putting a lot of investment into Portal for this year's game in part because fans want a game they can keep playing over and over again and finding new things along the way.</p><p>"People don't just want a game that they can complete," Pimm told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. "They want one that they can grow, that they can evolve, or they can make their dreams come true."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CHDiFW0wA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Portal is similar to Fortnite's Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Halo's Forge. For Battlefield 6, the developer is expanding what's possible and allowing users to create entire maps, and these maps and modes will provide XP like you'd get in the official playlists. However, anyone hoping to create a map with an XP exploit shouldn't expect that to work. The Portal mode will displays warnings within the editor to alert creators about whether or not their creation will allow for genuine XP gain or not.</p><p>Pimm said Battlefield 6's Portal mode was designed to help players "have a good time" and find something they want to play, even if it wasn't made by Battlefield Studios itself.</p><p>"[We want to] listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible," Pimm said.</p><p>During the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal event, the developers showed off a brief look at what's possible with the new version of Portal. In one sequence, we see something that looks like it's out of GTA Online, with a player piloting a jet through a floating ring of tanks high above the ground. This was just one example of the totally out-there types of game modes that players will be able to create.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/" data-ref-id="1100-6533674">server browser</a> so players can find the maps and modes they're looking for.</p><p>During EA's latest financial briefing, CEO Andrew Wilson called out user-generated content as one of the ways the company is seeking to <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Prepared-Remarks.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"unlock the full potential of our strategy."</a></p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta begins August 7 for a limited group of players before expanding more widely later in the month. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-is-available-to-download-now-as-preloading-and-file-sizes-go-live/1100-6533668/" data-ref-id="1100-6533668">Preloading is available now</a> on all platforms, and you can find out more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta guide.</a> The full game launches October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shared more details on its upcoming expansion to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" data-ref-id="5000-538660">Kirby and the Forgotten World</a>, and it's looking like a great time for Kirby fans when it releases later this month.</p><p>Eager to win an award for the longest game name, Nintendo's upcoming Kirby and the Forgotten World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed Worlds will serve as both an upgrade and expansion to Kirby's 2022 platforming adventure. The Switch 2 version of the game will feature improved visuals and performance alongside a breadth of new levels and features.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3bJ8tGrj4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2h3bJ8tGrj4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Star-Crossed World DLC, Kirby will set off to find star fragments--which are aptly-named Starries--and use them to seal away an evil presence brought upon The Forgotten Land by a fallen meteor. The meteor's impact has transformed levels throughout The Forgotten Land to create Starry Stages, which players will need to explore thoroughly to find previously inaccessible areas if they want to find all of the Starries.</p><p>In addition to new stages, Star-Crossed Worlds will also introduce three new Mouthful modes. With these all-new additions, Kirby will be able to swallow and transform into Spring Mouth to jump higher than ever, Gear Mouth to climb walls, and Sign Mouth to slide down slopes.</p><p>Players who enjoy going all-in on collectibles will also be able to find Starry Coins scattered throughout the new levels that can be used to purchase new figures to add to Kirby's ever-growing collection from the base game. Meanwhile, there's even a new challenge to be found at the Colosseum in Waddle Dee Town, offering what are likely to be the most difficult fights yet.</p><p>If you already own Kirby and the Forgotten Land, you can purchase an upgrade pack containing the Nintendo Switch 2 improvements and Star-Crossed World add-on for $20. Alternatively, the base game and upgrade pack are available combined for $80.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Labubus are everywhere — dangling from <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-labubu-hermes-bag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga’s Hermes bag</a>, selling for <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/02/us-news/this-is-the-most-expensive-labubu-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than $10,000 on eBay</a>, <a href="https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/labubu-los-angeles-protests-ice-1200866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protesting ICE raids</a>, and sold at 7-Eleven. But Chinese toy company Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven, saying in a complaint <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/897729184/Labubu-lawsuit-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in July in California</a> that the blind boxes sold at 7-Eleven stores are counterfeit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pop Mart’s fuzzy, grinning plush toys are inspired by a series called <em>The Monsters</em>, designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. Pop Mart started selling plush Labubu keychains in 2023, but they became a sensation in 2025. Pop Mart made $1.8 billion in 2024 thanks to a 1,200% increase in plush toy sales from 2023 to 2024, it says in the complaint. Labubu sales alone added up to $418 million, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-chinese-manufacturing-culture-propel-our-business-success-says-pop-marts-wang-ning-302509769.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pop Mart founder Wang Ning said in a recent interview</a>. Pop Mart says in its lawsuit that the “surge in sales” is “a trend that is only increasing in 2025 so far.”</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Labubus are largely sold in themed blind boxes that include one of roughly a half-dozen or so options. For instance, an individual Have A Seat series blind box will include one of seven figures, and you won’t know what you’re getting until you open the sealed bag inside the box. One Labubu, with butter yellow fur, has its eyes squeezed shut. Another, with soft purple fuzz, also has its eyes shut — gently closed. The mint green Labubu’s wild eyes are open, colored a piercing teal.&nbsp;</p><p>The popularity of Labubus — and the built-in scarcity of low stock and the blind box system — means it can be relatively hard to get a Labubu. Or, at least, a Labubu that’s <em>definitely </em>real. There’s a growing market for counterfeit Labubus, colloquially called Lafufus, that have similar packaging but often have a low quality fake plush inside. Some people don’t really care; Lafufus have their own fanbase that loves them for their even more deranged look. (And for the price; the standard Labubu size typically costs around $20. Lafufus can be purchased for less than $10.) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labubu-knockoff-lafufu-monsters-cost-counterfeit-fake-pop-mart-doll-2025-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider reported</a> in May that Lafufus are having their own cultural moment — the jank is kind of funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Lafufus are everywhere on the internet; you’re probably not going to get a real Labubu from, say, TikTok Shop or Temu. But they’re also popping up in 7-Elevens around the country.</p><p>Pop Mart shows in the lawsuit several instances of what it says are 7-Eleven stores selling fake Labubus. The packaging the company has collected looks real enough, but inside, the Lafufus are real busted. The proportions are all wrong, and their heads fit improperly into their fur suits, giving them bulbous foreheads. Faces are misprinted, leaving the iconic mischievous grin slightly askew. Some are missing eyes. In one especially disturbing instance, some Lafufu maker has seemingly transposed a Labubu head on a naked Sonny Angel body.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Pop Mart does not offer its products in 7-Eleven stores, which are well known for offering snacks and everyday necessities, but not innovative, carefully managed, artist-designed toy experiences,” Pop Mart says in the complaint.</p><p>The big problem here for Pop Mart is that some people are likely seeing these products and buying them thinking they’re real Labubus — something the company says 7-Eleven is doing “knowingly, willfully, intentionally, and maliciously.” Pop Mart is suing on 17 different counts, including several different trademark, copyright, and trade dress violations, and is asking the court to force 7-Eleven to stop selling Lafufus and award Pop Mart damages for the infringement.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fake Labubu crackdown doesn’t stop there, though: Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/01/labubu-lafufu-china-counterfeit-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have seized tens of thousands of fake plushies</a>. Pop Mart is also reportedly trying to trademark the word Lafufu, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/01/labubu-lafufu-china-counterfeit-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Washington Post reported</a>, citing Chinese state media, in an effort to stop the fakes. U.K. police have seized “hundreds of thousands” of fake Labubus from its ports, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0qgnk7z8yo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to BBC</a>. The Better Business Bureau is also warning U.S. buyers about the influx of Lafufus; <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/lookupscam?q=all%3Dlabubu%26from%3D0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 70 complaints have been lodged with the organization</a> against companies or stores selling fakes. On Pop Mart’s end, <a href="https://www.popmart.com/us/help/authenticity-check" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company has a page on its website for people to verify and authenticate their Labubus</a>, scanning both a QR code on the Labubu blind box and a QR code on the Labubu wash label.</p><p>The danger of it all, for Pop Mart, is that counterfeits are flooding the market and undermining its exorbitant profits. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0qgnk7z8yo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The BBC says Lafufus are dangerous</a> for kids because they’re so poorly made: The eyes and feet pop off so easily that they can become choking hazards. And so, the market for Lafufus is “going underground,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/lafufu-chinese-fake-labubu-plush-toy-doll-popmart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Guardian</a>, where elderly women slice open molded plastic monster heads to prepare them for stuffing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yep, seems like it</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Yoshi's Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1eb08540a0165/yoshis-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>In yet another indication that time is indeed marching on and on, it seems that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> has somehow turned 30 years old.</p>
<p>Released in Japan on <strong>5th August 1995</strong>, Yoshi's Island marked a significant departure from its predecessor, yet received widespread critical acclaim regardless. It also happened to be the last 2D entry in the Super Mario series for over a decade before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> followed in 2006. And if we're being honest, the DS entry definitely lacked some of the ingenuity displayed in Yoshi's Island.</p>
<p>'Ingenuity' is really the key word here. The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> had this in spades, so Yoshi's Island had an awful lot to live up to. But by shifting the gameplay to focus on Yoshi, who was once merely a secondary character, players could now execute several new abilities, including the 'flutter' jump, egg throwing, and simply gobbling up and spitting out your enemies.</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough, environments within the game could actually be destroyed, whether it be from a well-placed egg throw or from one of the game's many enemies. We make a big fuss about how well <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> does environment destruction in 2025, but for those who perhaps weren't around 30 years ago, seeing something similar in an SNES game was simply astounding.</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget that you can turn in a helicopter. Amazing scenes.</p>
<p>So take a bow, Yoshi's Island. Amongst the likes of Super Mario World, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, you perhaps get forgotten a bit too often for our liking. But you're still one of our favourites, and you remain one of the greatest 2D platformers of all time (even if our beloved editor <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/soapbox_25_years_on_i_still_cant_get_into_yoshis_island">couldn't get on with it...</a>).</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s warp pack sounded like great fun as soon as it was announced as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">last month's Control Group warbond</a>, and it's warped its way into many players' hearts. This is thanks in part to some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m9oto2/why_the_warp_pack_is_stier_and_plus_some_cool/">cool tricks</a> and glitches you can use it to pull off, with the game's latest patch having seen Arrowhead opt to outlaw the cheekiest of these.</p>
<p>You see, for the uninitiated, each mission in the shooter kicks off with you descending onto a planet and therefore ends with you being extracted via shuttle back up to your ship. It's the circle of Helldiver life and it moves us all. Well aside from folks who'd taken to using a well-timed warp to escape their ride home as it took off.</p>

<p>Now, as you can see below, it's not as if this would leave perpetrators facing the consequences they should have. Instead of being marooned forever near the likes of Crimsican city Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch two (yes, that's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m6s4uq/if_you_thought_gun_was_a_silly_mega_city_name/">real location in Helldivers 2</a>, and yes, it's named after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxO0UdpoxM">infamous Welsh town</a>), the mission just ends as normal and you're magically beamed up, Scotty.</p>
<p>Enter patch 01.003.202, the full notes for which you canm find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516342955916658905?l=english">here</a>. "Disabled LIFT-182 warp pack fields around shuttles, preventing any Helldiver escapees," reads one of those notes. "You are done, it is time to go home." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi480s/well_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/">Awwwwwwwww</a>, say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi4b5t/this_has_got_to_be_the_best_thing_ah_has_added_to/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi50yw/patch_01003202/">players</a>, and I'd join in if pulling off the glitch didn't come with any potential to muck things up for other players.

</span></p><p>Outside of that, the patch is mostly minor bug fixes and tweaks, with a lot sticking to the theme of ensuring stuff from the Control Group warbond works as planned. For example, Arrowhead have decreased the Epoch plasma cannon's spread by 75% in an effort to improve its accuracy, made sure the laser sentry displays heat build up properly, and a couple of less flashy corrections to the warp pack on top of the extraction one.</p>
<p>There's also a fix for the manic laughter emote not triggering sound when done on a ship, because in space people apparently should be able to hear you creepily giggling.</p>
<p>That's it for now, but with players keen for a lot more fixes amid what's understandably been a relatively quiet summer for Arrowhead, studio CEO Shams Jorjani's suggested via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1402298082757971968">the game's Discord</a> that they're writing up a blog post that'll outline how they're prioritising which bugs get fixed first. The exec says there's "a very complex answer", so hopefully that rubric'll help the two sides of the coin be on the same page, especially since communication <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-arrowhead-addresses-escalation-of-freedom-update-backlash-60-day-plan">hasn't always been Arrowhead's strong suit</a> over the past year and a bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-patch-puts-a-stop-to-the-warp-packs-cheekiest-party-trick-because-you-are-done-it-is-time-to-go-home]]></content:encoded>

              <p>When I woke up this morning, I didn’t expect I’d see a new live-action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/power-rangers-black-yellow-racial-stereotypes-1851775454">1990s-inspired <em>Power Rangers</em> </a>clip featuring Peely from <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. And I really didn’t expect to be so blown away by it that I’d end up rewatching the ad like five times. Yet here we are.</p> <p>On August 5, ahead of the release of <em>Fortnite’s</em> Chapter 6 Season 4 later this week, Epic Games released a live-action teaser trailer confirming that the original <em>Power Rangers</em> will be a part of the game’s upcoming season. Normally, I would not waste your time sharing trailers or teasers for random video game updates. But this trailer is just so awesome that I have to share it, if only so I can watch it a few more times and say it was for my job so I don’t feel as guilty. Here’s the ’90s-inspired live-action trailer, complete with <a href="https://youtu.be/MXSWM9Z5Stk">everything you’d expect from the OG show</a>, including cheap-looking special effects and all the action taking place in a quarry.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bad Bugs vs Power Rangers in Fortnite BR: Shock ‘N Awesome | Live Action Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZIbokU9tRg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1952731322994012178?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">The upcoming “Shock ‘N Awesome” season</a> will feature an invasion of deadly alien bugs, and it seems that the Power Rangers are being called in for backup. They have beaten up a lot of dudes in rubber bug suits, so they can likely help out. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-trailer-power-rangers-release-date-skins-2000638994">As pointed out by <em>Gizmodo</em>,</a> this wild trailer is some of the first new live-action<em> Power Rangers</em> content created and aired since 2023. I can imagine that for big fans of the franchise, this is an odd moment. You finally got some cool new<em> Power Rangers</em> action, but it arrives as part of a <em>Fortnite</em> trailer. The universe is strange like that.</p> <p><em>Fortnite’s</em> next big season, Shock ‘N Awesome, arrives on August 7 on all platforms where the game is available.</p>

The game will feature a "preferred input" matchmaking system, where players using controllers (on Xbox and PlayStation) are primarily matched with other controller users. Likewise, PC players using a mouse and keyboard will be grouped. Cross-play between the two input types will only occur when needed to fill lobbies. This new system aims to reduce input-based advantages while still maintaining quick matchmaking.</p><p>According to producer Alexia Christofi, the game will prioritize keeping players within their preferred community. It will expand to mix platforms when regional player counts are too low for stable matchmaking. This approach is designed to improve fairness in matches while still ensuring low lags and fast match creation. Cross-play will still be fully toggleable in the settings for players who want more control.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951700052625518667" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Eyy not quite, it's crossplay on or off - but if crossplay is on we treat it as console preferred crossplay, so we'll try and matchmake you with others playing on console before falling back to full crossplay if we can't find you a match with only/mostly console players.</p>  — Alexia Christofi (@Lex_mate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951700052625518667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reflect-on-battlefield-2042s-poor-launch-and-how-it-shaped-new-game/1100-6533676/" data-ref-id="1100-6533676">Battlefield 2042</a>, cross-play between console and PC was fully enabled by default, which led to imbalanced matches, resulting in <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-2042-general-discussion-en/re-severely-unbalanced-teams/6997455" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uneven gameplay experiences</a>. Battlefield 6 builds on this by treating cross-play as a fallback option rather than the default setup.</p><p>EA is also addressing questions surrounding skill-based matchmaking (SBMM), which has become a debated feature in modern shooters.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/and-roger-is-a-short-moving-game-about-family.1262634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I saw several of my peers talking about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308870/and_Roger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>and Roger</em></a>, a short game for PC and Switch that calls itself an “interactive novel.” It took me about an hour to play and costs just a few bucks, and it’s practically impossible to talk about it without thoroughly spoiling it, but I’m glad I checked it out.</p><p>As the game’s description explains, <em>and Roger</em> starts with a young girl named Sofia waking up to find a strange man in her house where her dad is supposed to be. It’s upsetting and creepy, though the eventual explanation you get radically changes the experience. The game’s simple art, pastel colors, and jaunty soundtrack offset this tone, making everything feel disorienting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="“and Roger” 1st Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrZMV5-Khz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most of <em>and Roger</em>’s gameplay is minigames, none of them particularly well-explained. As an example, in the early game Sofia brushes her teeth; you’re given several unexplained buttons to click, and you have to fumblingly parse out how to turn on the water, get toothpaste on your toothbrush, and actually brush. Trying to open a door involves choosing the right buttons from an onslaught of dots, and trying to dial a phone involves guessing at and then memorizing button presses. Later minigames involve tracing patterns or lines, some of which you can’t see at first.&nbsp;</p><p>As they’re clearly meant to, many of these minigames feel confusing and frustrating, though never enough to make the game itself feel that way. This is all meant to put you in Sofia’s shoes, outmatched by the tasks before her. It’s an evocative way to portray her distress, especially once the game’s real subject matter becomes clear.</p><p>I do want to touch on what that subject matter is, so stop reading here if you want to just go play the game for yourself. If you want to check it out but feel the need to be more prepared, I’ll say that there’s no kidnapping or child abuse in the game, as the setup and opening might seem to suggest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SPOILERS FOLLOW.</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="and Roger - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5Ink1cIvpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It comes out later in the game that Sofia is actually an older woman suffering from dementia, and the game’s opening chapter is her experience of an encounter with her husband, Roger, who’s taking care of her. With this reveal, <em>and Roger</em>’s mechanics take on a new tone; they reflect the confusion Sofia feels as daily tasks become more challenging. From its dark beginning, the game becomes a more gentle and moving exploration of what it’s like to care for a declining loved one.</p><p>I found this hard subject matter to sit with: though I worked with caregivers for loved ones with dementia in a past career, it’s something I feel acutely anxious about as my parents age. Despite having professionally counselled others through it, my fear about the challenges and intimacy that will be required of me with my own family sometimes overwhelms me. (I watched about ten minutes of the movie <em>All Of Us Strangers</em> a few months ago, realized it was about parents, and promptly turned it off.)&nbsp;</p><p>There aren’t many narratives about cognitive decline from the point of view of the people experiencing them. Some of this is for obvious reasons, but I think it’s also just that it’s a hard thing to consider. I admired <em>and Roger</em>’s effort to really look at it, and to use game mechanics to try to portray what the experience might be like. The game doesn’t shy away from the hard parts–we see Roger struggle, and he admits to a few occasions when he physically lashed out at Sofia–but it also doesn’t portray the whole thing as a tragedy or Sofia as a burden. It’s a nuanced take for such a short game. I appreciated my time with it, even when it was tough.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/and-roger-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 will sport significantly better ray tracing performance than the base PlayStation 5, a performance uplift in line with the current generation system's rasterization performance improvement over the PlayStation 4, which somehow signals a change in focus for the company.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> provided additional comments on last week's <a href="https://youtu.be/x9WV8r-T6LI?si=sp3489uSdifLvgTt&amp;t=3327">P</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">layStation 6 leaks</a>, revealing that while specs may have been changed since that presentation, the fundamental idea behind the next-generation system hasn't changed. While the two to three times the PS5 rasterization performance estimation has been confirmed, Moore's Law is Dead provided some additional details on the system's ray tracing performance, saying that it will be five to ten times the current generation system ray tracing performance. </p>



<p>The rasterization and ray tracing performance uplift that the PlayStation 6 will deliver over that of its predecessor makes sense, according to the leaker. Rasterization performance has essentially been saturated, and with the PlayStation 5 already delivering framerates in the 80s range in some titles at 4K resolution, it makes sense to have a limited rasterization performance to hit a reasonable 4K, 120 FPS target for the most common TVs while keeping costs down and still offering a significant performance improvement where it matters more. James Prior, former AMD Senior Product Manager, agrees with this sentiment, as the focus has shifted from rasterization performance to other things like ray tracing and AI upscaling. Additionally, a 4K, 120 FPS capable machine capable of delivering RTX 4080, 5080 performance is going to be a very enticing proposition at anything below $900, especially considering some of the typical console advantages over PCs like smaller form factor, plug and play convenience, power draw and more and the fact that the system is never going to compete with gaming PCs, unlike what the next-generation Xbox could be doing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility offered by the Magnus APU</a>.  As such, <span>Sony going the other way </span>in a market with a "$1000 fatigue"&nbsp;with devices like smartphones and GPUs costing $1000 or more would be very interesting.</p>

<p>Going from what has been leaking online in the past few weeks, the next console generation promises to be extremely interesting in some unexpected ways. Hopefully, what the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox will offer will be put to good use to deliver some truly next-gen experiences that could impress even those like Hideo Kojima who are feeling a sort of stagnation with games that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">look and play the same.</a></p>

            <p>A brace of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> reporting has treated us to the first details of the game's combat system. Here are the headlines: counter attacks, weapon degradation and an energy bar that lets you perform power moves and dodge in slow motion. It's apparently reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> in that you have a stamina system and the dodge and counter timing can be tricky - a summary I would say also describes Punch-Out! from 1984, if I wanted to be a snarky little shitlord. There are no guns, just melee weapons that range from scavenged baseball bats to naginata polearms, looted from a spirit world of shrines and masked figures. </p><!--more-->
<p>Lob a naginata into an online gaming forum roundabouts now, and there's a one in six chance you'll seriously injure somebody who's miffed about all this. It's possible, mind, that they are miffed because some previewer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">innocently suggested that Soulslikes might be an influence</a> (the devs haven't spelled this out, as far as I know) and this fleeting observation has been internet-telephoned into the argument that Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> with schoolgirls. But also, they will be miffed because resenting Silent Hill's combat is integral to enjoying Silent Hill. It is the Silent Hillite's most treasured pastime.</p>
<p>I've held forth in the past about why the series absolutely doesn't need a combat system, and why any and all efforts to "improve" it with more complex mechanics are akin to putting wing mirrors on Pyramid Head. Lately, though, I've found peace in the idea that Silent Hill needing a combat system is Silent Hill's original curse. That need will always haunt the town's hospitals and schools - the ghost of a 'real' action game, tethered to this plane by the whims of commerce, trying to make sense of itself in a story about unschooled protagonists and squishy manifestations of self-loathing, doomed forever to be an uncertain mixture of pretty bad or fine but out-of-place.</p>
<p>It's not like Silent Hill f developers Neobards are breaking terrifying new ground for the series: Silent Hill 4 had weapon degradation already. The strangest aspect of the combat is a special move gauge that's tethered, Amnesia-style, to your character's mental wellbeing. The more spooked she is, the less slow-mo power attack juice she'll have at her disposal. This could be either a bruisingly artificial or clever way of raising the stakes during boss battles. Anyway, I remain more fascinated by the setting and story, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">read about here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine]]></content:encoded>
