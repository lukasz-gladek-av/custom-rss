			<p>Battlefield 6 has been out on PC and consoles for three days at the time of this writing, and already, players are getting frustrated with the XP grind to unlock new weapons and attachments. So, players have turned to an old workaround for Battlefield games: create a custom server in Portal, and farm XP in bot matches. EA, for its part, is trying to stop players from boosting by shutting down the more popular farms, but players can always make new ones.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-6-fast-xp-farms-progression-times-portal-ea-response">VG247</a>, a select few Portal servers were popularized when YouTubers and content creators began making videos with titles like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5Df2dvxC0"><em>How to Unlock Weapons, Attachments, Gadgets, and Soldiers Faster in Battlefield 6</em>.</a>" Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4n1c3/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> were also sharing codes to let other players find their XP-farming servers, as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5f660/weapon_attachments/">community has seemingly rallied around the feeling</a> that earning XP for weapons, attachments, gadgets, and soldiers is <em>"ridiculously slow</em>."</p>



<p>In response to players using Portal for XP farming, EA seems to be shutting down the more popular servers, and players are now running into error messages telling them that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5emdf/biggest_shit_take_of_all_launch/">EA's servers "<em>are at max capacity</em>," </a>stopping players from creating new servers.</p>



<p>Of course, this won't last forever, and EA can't exactly play an endless game of whack-a-mole with Portal servers to try and stop everyone from doing any amount of XP farming. It's also not like Battlefield 6 is the first Battlefield game where players have turned to Portal for this exact reason.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">Even in our review</a> of Battlefield 6, we noted that the grind for weapons and attachments, specifically those that can only be unlocked through certain situational challenges, wasn't something we particularly liked, even if it can be seen as a way of changing up the tried-and-true method of just levelling up your character and weapon to unlock everything. </p>



<p>Since theoretically, you could jump into matches and focus on only completing those challenges where possible. But that's not exactly the way to play if you're just trying to have a good time in Battlefield 6, or any multiplayer game, for that matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll see EA stop its whack-a-mole game and adjust some of the situational challenges and XP requirements so that players can unlock what they want, without too much hassle, and the game can find its meta more naturally. Rather than it becoming a case of 'players who farmed XP in Portal vs. players who didn't,' and since only one of those sides is going to have better and more weapons, attachments, and gadgets available to them, it's pretty clear which side is coming out on top.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-2000634598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies.1323541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during hurricane season, winter storms knocking out electricity for days or those rolling blackouts during summer heatwaves – these aren’t rare anymore, they’re becoming the new normal. Having a reliable backup power source is now essential for keeping your family safe and comfortable when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">price on the 1,800W EcoFlow Delta 2 from $699 to $429</a>, which makes it the lowest price we’ve ever tracked for this powerhouse portable power station that <strong>can run 90% of your household appliances</strong>. This is the unit that sells out every time severe weather hits and right now you can grab it at 39% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Power Station</h2>
<p>The EcoFlow Delta 2 is equipped with a <strong>1024-watt-hour LiFePO4 battery that has 1800W of continuous AC power</strong> through four standard wall outlets. That 1800-watt power rating puts it in a whole different class compared to smaller power stations because it can power high-draw appliances such as space heaters, power tools, electric grills, and even clothes washers.</p>
<p>The unit achieves a <strong>surge capacity of up to 2700 watts to power the initial surge</strong> of power with motor-driven appliances turning on so that your refrigerator or air conditioner kicks on without a hiccup. LiFePO4 chemistry is capable of over <strong>3000 full charge cycles until the battery degrades to 80% capacity</strong>, which equates to about 10 years of day use. This is six times longer compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries used within lower-cost power stations.</p>



<p>The charging speed on this device is completely nuts: The <strong>Delta 2 reaches 80% from zero in 50 minutes</strong> and 100% in 80 minutes with a standard wall outlet. That’s seven times as fast as previous EcoFlow products and enables you to get disaster backup power virtually instantly when storms are looming. The product feeds 1200 watts of AC input to the battery and that’s why it charges that quickly. The fans do run noisier during this fast charging mode and reaches approximately 58 decibels, but the charging speed can be lowered with the EcoFlow app to minimize noise if you are charging overnight.</p>
<p>The front panel is flush<strong> with 15 assorted outlets</strong>: You’ve got four AC outlets that together carry a rating of 1800 watts, two USB-C ports each carrying 100 watts of power (capable of fast-charging two MacBook Pros simultaneously), four USB-A with assorted speeds including two capable of 18-watt fast charging, one 12-volt auto outlet ideal for items such as portable coolers, and one DC5521 output port.</p>



<p>The LCD display shows real-time power input and output in watts, remaining battery percentage and estimated runtime based on your current load. This makes it easy to see exactly how much juice you have left and plan accordingly. The <em>EcoFlow</em> app adds remote control functionality and allows you to monitor power usage from anywhere, adjust charging speeds, and control connected outlets even when you’re not near the unit. The app also provides detailed energy consumption statistics so you can see which devices are draining the battery fastest.</p>
<p>The <strong>unit weighs 27 pounds</strong> which is heavier than the smaller capacity power stations yet light enough to be lifted with one hand with the heavy-duty built-in handle. The compact unit doesn’t occupy much floor space, and the top is level to easily stack items on top of it or store it away under a desk. The power station functions in extreme temperatures as well as features advanced battery management with 62 different protective features that <strong>watch temperature, voltage, current, and other vitals to ensure that everything stays within the safety range</strong>.</p>
<p>At $429 instead of $699, this is a 39% off deal and the lowest price that this power station has ever reached on Amazon. As with these units, they always seem to run out of stock during natural disasters when everyone wakes up as one to the sudden realization that they could use some backup power, so don’t delay waiting until the next hurricane watch to come to a decision.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood.1323529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein getting a sequel, as announced at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, was a pleasant surprise. The original was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/code-vein-review"><u>good</u></a>! It was one of those games that necessarily didn’t blow people away, but was fun popcorn for action-RPG fans who like deep character creators, over-the-top plots, and far more weapons and customization choices than any person can reasonably keep track of. But good or not, loads of excellent games in this genre never resurface after their initial debut, so Bandai Namco being willing to return to its twist on vampires and take another crack at perfecting the pitch is some seriously good news. Sure, the developer has disavowed any plot connections to the original, which has some fans worried. But I just got 45 minutes of hands-off time with Code Vein 2, and came out feeling confident that direct sequel or no, this follow-up feels like a far more fully realized vision of the fast-paced, flashy action RPG that Code Vein 1 was always striving to be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dress to Impress</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I did get a very, very brief stint of hands-on time with Code Vein 2, in that Bandai Namco let me mess around in the c haracter creator before they took over. No huge surprises here, but if you liked the robustness of Code Vein 1’s character creator and can spend hours tweaking eyebrow shapes, I’ve got good news for you. You can choose from preset designs, of course, for folks who don’t want to sit on this screen all day, but you can also adjust minute details like teeth and ear shapes if that’s more your bag. I had a lot of fun picking out a really big, silly hat for my character to wear. One of my favorite elements of the creator is the ability to select an outfit, and then turn on and off certain pieces of it. Love a cute dress but hate the weird garter it makes you wear with it? Just turn it off! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I had settled on a cute hat and hairstyle, I handed the controller back over to the devs, and sat back to watch what they had to show me. The mission they elected to demonstrate was one where the player is sent off with a partner (a buddy) named Josée to restore power to a city area. They selected the quest area from a large overworld map and traveled there instantly, though they arrived not in a closed dungeon but in a large, lovely, ruined city with multiple dungeons available to them just by running (or driving a motorcycle) around. I got to watch some gameplay both from an optional dungeon near where we landed, and from the actual objective dungeon itself, a substation where the hero might be able to get the city’s power running again.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Define “Open”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One big question I had going into this preview was whether Code Vein 2 was open world, or open zone, or something else. After chatting with the team, asking about the issue several times, and watching the demo, I’m still not 100% sure how to answer this. The team says it’s not open world, but also kept saying Code Vein 2 had “one single overworld” and that traveling is “a bit more open” than in Code Vein 1. There does seem to be a lot of interconnectivity – I watched the he=ro zoom around the outdoor area on a motorcycle (with Josée adorably sitting cross-legged on the back) and covering some meaningful distance without running into artificial walls, but it’s possible there were some much further along. Director Hiroshi Yoshimura also told me that the overworld is “significantly” bigger, while the dungeon sizes are roughly the same as Code Vein 1. Make of all that what you will for now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I asked about the world, director Yoshimura repeatedly pointed out that the focus was less on exploration and more on the various character companions you’ll meet in Code Vein 2. You’ll be traveling to points in the world specifically for missions tied to these characters that will let you get to know them better. Much of Code Vein 2 does indeed seem to be centered around these buddies, or partners as they’re now called, even more so than the first game since the sequel won’t feature co-op.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Friend Circle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In my preview, I got a decent look at some of the partner dynamics between the main character and Josée. Josée’s got a big ol’ sword she swings around, slow but powerful, and at different points I saw her light it on fire for both close-up and long-range attacks. Without actually playing myself it’s hard to say whether or not the AI has improved from Code Vein 1 (where it could be a bit finicky or, at times, suicidal). Though, if you hate dealing with AI partners at all, they can assist you in Code Vein 2 via “assimilation” – effectively removing them from the battlefield, but giving yourself significant stat boosts and powerful new abilities to compensate. One other feature I did appreciate was the ability of partners to revive you when you fall in battle, and vice versa if your partners fall, wisely on a cooldown so it can’t be spammed for immortality. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I could see, Code Vein veterans will be perfectly happy with the sequel’s bursting larder of combat abilities and character customization. Code Vein 2 wants you to get really comfortable cycling through different types of skills, and boy, you better keep track of all those Proper Nouns. But here’s the jist: you’ll attack with your weapon to start building up bleeds on an enemy, then use your equipped auxiliary “Jail” weapon to gain a resource called Ichor. Ichor can then be spent on far more powerful abilities, such as “bequeathed formae”, special, powerful weapons like a huge bow and arrow or a powerful shield. Or, you can activate your Jails for huge finisher moves, like swinging an enormous scythe or briefly gaining big, vampiric wings.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t mean to spend this whole preview lamenting that this was a hands-off demo, but man, I wish I could have gotten ahold of a controller just to muck around in the menus! Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective, and even with just the options I saw in the demo I feel like I could waste a lot of time wildly flailing around with different combinations until I was happy with my particular expression of it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">When This Baby Hits 88mph… </h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I unfortunately didn’t get a chance to see anything from one of Code Vein 2’s most intriguing key features: time travel. It takes place in a present day where a horrible calamity has taken place in the past, and you and your companions are given the ability to travel back in time and change history. Though you’re strongly urged not to meddle with the past, obviously, you do anyway. I’m told you’re allowed to freely travel between past and present most of the time (occasionally you’ll be locked out of doing so), and things you do in the past can influence what’s going on in the present, even to the point of making it impossible to return to the present. But I wasn’t able to see any of that in action during my preview, so it’s hard for me to say how extensive or interesting this element actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other, somewhat fangirly note - hey, I love Go Shiina’s music? Shiina returns as composer for Code Vein 2 after working on Code Vein 1, and he’s also composed for my two favorite Tales games (don’t laugh at me for this): Tales of Legendia and Tales of Zestiria. His excellence was on full display both in my preview and in the story trailer I watched ahead of time, with soaring strings and chaotic vocals backing Code Vein 2’s intense battles. Sign me up for another banger Shiina soundtrack, thanks!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bandai Namco has confirmed that Code Vein 2 is a complete departure from the story and universe of the first game, it’s familiar enough in gameplay and style that I came away feeling pretty happy with the direction. I’ve seen fans calling it a “soft reboot” and I think that’s an accurate summation: it’s true to the philosophy of Code Vein without being beholden to its lore Wiki. Nothing I’ve seen has shocked me so far, but I don’t think it needs to: everything good about Code Vein 1 is here, just bigger, shinier, and slash-slash-slashier. Now just let me tinker around in the character creator for just a few more minutes…</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Packs are paid DLC that bring new “bite-sized-yet-flavourful” narrative content to Borderlands 4. In Bounty Pack 1, due out November 20, players team up with Rush and “show the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture the true meaning of Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Pack 1 also includes a Vault Card with new rewards that players will earn through gameplay, with 24 cosmetic items to unlock and four pieces of rerollable gear. The rerollable gear can be earned as many times as players like, so it can be an opportunity to obtain a roll with stats that perfectly suit a specific build, Gearbox said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Rush, the affable leader of the Outbounders, is feeling homesick and nostalgic for the holidays he's cherished in years past. By his calculations, it's about to be Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family, and he'd like to bring that same festive cheer to the people of Kairos. But his hopes for holiday merriment stand in direct opposition to Screw, the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture who's charged with keeping celebrations as bland and homogenous as possible. Across a series of all-new Main Missions, you'll show Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day by any means necessary, and maybe score some new Legendary loot in the process.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Here's the full breakdown of the Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Bounty Pack 1 also features a few extras to find:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Digirunner Vehicle (available shortly after starting the first Main Mission)</li><li>1 Vault Hunter Style usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li><li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">To access Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more., you need to have either bought the Borderlands 4 Deluxe or Super Deluxe Edition (both include the Bounty Pack Bundle), or bought the Bounty Pack Bundle that includes Bounty Pack 1, or bought Bounty Pack 1 individually.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-bountypack1-1760358945640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day contents.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4’s free seasonal mini-event, Horrors of Kairos.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now-2000634493</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ryzen-5-lenovo-copilot-gaming-laptop-just-took-more-than-1-000-haircut-at-amazon-feels-practically-free-now.1323502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers and deal hunters usually don’t fish in the same ponds. Deal hunters are often willing to cut a few corners and give up a few features in the name of the almighty wallet. But to a gamer, sacrificing features like a fast processor and quick, reactive screen mean certain elimination in a battle royal game or enough lag-induced annoyance that those extra few hundred bucks are almost always worth shelling out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">But when a gaming laptop like this 15-inch beauty from Lenovo takes a sharp and completely unexpected $1,000 price dive at Amazon and is transformed from a $1,700 investment into an incredible $650 deal</a>, the gamers and deal hunters will be racing to be the first to click buy. And while Amazon’s supply of these hot gaming laptops is almost certainly ample, the amount of time left on the deal might not be — it’s always hard to tell just how “limited” a limited-time Amazon deal is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Specs Check Out</h2>
<p>We know the deal hunters were already satisfied when they saw that 62% discount label on this Lenovo, but the gamers are all about the specs. Good news — they check out, starting with the six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with a base speed of 3.3GHz and boost speed up to 4.55GHz. Add in the 40GB of DDR5 RAM and large-scale 1TB PCIe SSD, and while it may not be able to go toe to toe with those $3,000-plus pro rigs, the Lenovo massively overperforms on that new $650 Amazon price.</p>
<p>The screen also passes muster — it’s a 15.3-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS panel with a slightly taller aspect ratio than the standard 16:9 for a little extra visual real estate. The 300 nits of brightness combined with anti-glare coating mean you don’t have to dim all the lights and draw the blackout shades to get a good picture. The Radeon 660M integrated GPU is perfect for eSports, mid-level FPS and battle royal games, and most definitely for streaming and creative work.</p>



<h2>Lagless Internet</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 is an absolute must for any gaming laptop, and the Lenovo delivers, along with Bluetooth 5.3 for controllers. There’s DisplayPort support too, along with other ports including two USB-A, one HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader. It’s preloaded with Windows 11 Pro and Microsoft Copilot, so even when it’s not in gaming mode it’s a more than ample everyday laptop.</p>
<p>While the gaming shoppers almost never look at anything below four figures, and deal hunters won’t normally seek anything with that comma in the price, everyone’s wants, needs, and interests are satisfied by the 62% off limited-time Amazon deal on this 15.3-inch Lenovo gaming laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">It’s just $650 if you’re quick enough to catch it before it’s gone.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Life continues to find a way with a new entry in the fan-favorite saga with Jurassic World Evolution 3, and we’ve got all the platform details for the title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes big additions to the franchise in the form of baby dinosaurs and piece-by-piece construction, with mechanics that were initially seen in the Planet Coaster series and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With Jurassic World Evolution 3 roaring onto the scene, we’ve got everything you need to know about the title, including it’s availability on various platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-on-ps4-or-xbox-one">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 on PS4 or Xbox One?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blossoming. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not available on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, and is solely a current-gen exclusive title.</strong></p>



<p>This marks the first time in the franchise that the title has not been available on PS4 or Xbox One, though it is in line with other <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Developments</a> releases. Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2, for example, were not released on either platform.</p>



<p>Significant enhancements have been made since Jurassic World Evolution 2, with Planet Zoo’s console version and Planet Coaster 2 both releasing after the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>Moving forward, it’s further evidence that Frontier Development games are unlikely to be available on last-gen consoles, with any new releases likely to be only PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-jurassic-world-evolution-3-platforms-explained">All Jurassic World Evolution 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, there are no last-gen releases for Jurassic World Evolution 3, nor is there any news on a launch on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. While the Switch 2 may have the capacity for the title on the console, there’s no indication that Evolution 3 will make the jump to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>There could be future platform releases later on, however. Planet Zoo was initially released as a PC exclusive in 2019, before being ported to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later. However, this seems unlikely this time around, unless a Switch 2 launch is on the cards.</p>

              <p>The mascot for late-stage capitalism is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcfav-5kArM">that final orgy scene in horror classic <em>Society</em></a>. (Do not click on that YouTube link in any circumstances, ever.) Everything consuming everything else until all that’s left is one monstrous behemoth of hideous depravity. So, moments after Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance for just one $16 million bribe and <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">the head of Stephen Colbert</a>, the resulting mutilation is trying to come for Warner Bros. Discovery. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach">according to&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em></a>&nbsp; its first attempt has been rebuffed for being too low of a bid.</p> <p>Among a great deal else, Warner Bros. owns all of DC, including its movies, TV shows and comics, and the many video game spin-offs including the&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em> Batman games. Then it has everything&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts</em>, as well as all of the enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games. Which is to say, along with being a massive movie studio and streamer (it also owns HBO), it’s a very significant player in the world of video games.</p>

 <p>Word began spreading that Paramount was circling the movie, TV and video game studio a while back, with&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/david-zaslav-warner-bros-purchase-paramount-david-ellison-1236575377/"><em>Deadline</em> reporting last week</a> that the plan was to swoop in and pick up the entire media corporation before current Warner boss David Zaslav splits the company in half. Motivated by the Trump-controlled FCC’s allowance of the merger with Skydance, Paramount seems to believe it can bypass concerns of monopolies once more and take over Bugs Bunny’s business in just six months. But it seems the first approach hasn’t been good enough for Zaslav.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, an offer of $20 per share was made in recent weeks, which Warner didn’t consider high enough.&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>‘s reporting says that Zaslav is looking for $30 a share, while claiming it had heard Paramount boss David Ellison was offering $22-$24. If&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg</em> is correct, it seems the money people came in even lower, testing how desperate Zaslav is to sell. And, if you’re interested, the shares are currently valued at $17.10, making Warner Bros. Discovery worth $42.3 billion, but also carrying a ton of debt. Apparently Paramount’s $17 shares make <em>it&nbsp;</em>worth only $18.6 billion. How can one buy the other, you ask? Because money isn’t real, and big businesses can fudge any old shite they want.</p>

 <p>It seems Zaslav really wants to split the company, separating it into a (surely doomed) cable TV company (that you just have to imagine will magically take on so much of the debt), and a streaming and studios company. So, I guess, when the former fails the debt goes away? Is that how it works? It seems too horribly likely that that’s how it works. Then, without the old-world cable TV anvil strapped around its neck, it’d make the remaining company a lot more likely to be more highly valued in a buy-out.</p> <p>Presumably Paramount won’t give up, with future approaches likely to include upping its offer or going directly to shareholders—this is very likely just a first, exploratory poke of the ant nest. And soon, everything will be owned by one giant corporation to which we will forcibly pledge our allegiance and worship every Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s Campaign offers players an ‘Uninstall’ button once they have finished it. </p>



<p>EA’s highly sought-after FPS title, Battlefield 6, has finally been released, and it is already dominating the Steam charts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing</a> Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count within a day of launch. Now, new details about the BF6’s campaign have been revealed, and it seems that this game mode provides players with an option to ‘uninstall’. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-campaign-can-be-easily-uninstalled-once-completed">Battlefield 6 Campaign Can be Easily Uninstalled Once Completed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-ea-electronic-arts-campaign-hdd-space-uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, a post by BobNetworkUK on <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1977095756193710437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals that the Battlefield 6 Campaign screen will replace the usual button with an uninstall button once the player has completed the game mode. The original poster stated that players can continue playing and completing challenges if they don’t want to uninstall the mode, as it still features mission select. Still, many players might be happy to be offered that option once this game mode has been completed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding Battlefield 6’s campaign, we know it features nine missions spanning three continents: Africa, North America, and Europe. The game mode also lets players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-lets-players-command-a-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">command a full squad</a> at almost all times, with each member belonging to a different class. Moreover, the revive system works similarly to multiplayer: if a player has been downed, a squad member can revive them, and vice versa.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers have confirmed that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not feature generative AI</a>. Additionally, the open beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intentionally had smaller maps</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6’s campaign telling you to uninstall the mode once completed?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1976774165207060716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1976774165207060716%7Ctwgr%5E189fd63311bfa1ba40ae994f5c95a230fe717dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Fglen-powell-wants-a-part-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-movie-1616433%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> during this weekend's New York Comic-Con 2025, Hollywood star Glen Powell revealed that he has been playing (and enjoying) Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a lot lately, and he'd like to be in the movie, too.</p>



<p><em>Expedition 33 is one of that I've become a fan of. If there's an Expedition 33 movie, I'd be very interested.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear whether Glen Powell is aware that a live action adaptation of the game was announced in January 2025, before the game's launch (which happened on April 24). The film will be produced by Story Kitchen, formerly known as dj2 Entertainment, a production company focused specifically on adapting game IPs. They already have experience with the successful Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and also have signed deals to bring many other franchises to the big and small screen, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-kaos-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, Sifu, and Vampire Survivors.</p>



<p>Casting for the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 movie is yet to be announced. Of course, Glen Powell would be a big get. Following his roles in Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man, Anyone but You, Twisters, and Chad Powers, Powell is now one of the top leading actors in Hollywood. His next appearances will be in The Running Man, an Edgar Wright-directed film adapted from the 1982 dystopian novel by Stephen King, and Ghostwriter, J.J. Abrams' next fantasy movie.</p>



<p>Can Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive afford him, though? Sure, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has surpassed five million copies sold, which is certainly much more than they were expecting. </p>



<p>At any rate, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-future-update-to-add-new-location-costumes-and-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are preparing a free update</a> that will add new late game bosses and a brand new location to explore to the game. This will be a thank-you for the whole community.</p>

            <p>Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> was one of a number of games Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">tossed in the bin</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs earlier this year</a>. It was disappointing, if not a huge surprise given how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">protracted Everwild's development had been</a> up until its demise, with lots of questions remaining as to what the mysterious ramble through nature would be like to play.</p>
<p>Now, some leaked screenshots might offer a bit more of an idea as to some of the stuff you'd have been able to get up to in between patting various creatures and swinging a staff around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The screens, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details">mp1st</a>, offer a look at the game's interfaces and menus. The site report they've come from an artist's website and are from a version of the game that existed not long before Microsoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>
<p>One sees the player character standing with their inventory open, with their pockets boasting tools, plants, seeds, mosaics, and figments. It's the latter that's caught my attention, as they look to be cute little plant creatures. Given the farm or base building-esque feel of the menu, might these figments have been pint-sized helpers with your gardening ventures? Sadly, we won't know until someone from Rare chats about the game.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="es"><p>Se han publicado screenshots del cancelado <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Everwild?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Everwild</a> a través de un artista que estuvo en <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rare</a> para el proyecto.</p><p>De acuerdo a lo informado a MP1ST, estas imágenes serían de una versión del juego bastante cercana a su cancelación en Junio de este año. <a href="https://t.co/FN9ci0VOMn">pic.twitter.com/FN9ci0VOMn</a></p></div>— Soul Gizzmo (@SoulGizzmo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulGizzmo/status/1977514481581273449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>A couple of other screens show the character standing by a patch of grass ringed by an overgrown path. Twinned with the statue and columns you can make out in some of the shots, some exploration or uncovering of old ruins or temples looks possible. Such a thing would match the druidy vibes of Everwild's trailers, and it'd make sense if the group of eternals the player belonged to were an ancient sect or culture you'd learn more about by exploring their former abodes. Or perhaps you'd be tasked with exploring the old homes of another civilisation who in some way messed up the rhythm of nature and paid for it.</p>
<p>Some of the screens are also very blurry, so maybe you'd find a camera in these ruins and be physically unable to work out how to use the focus, because you're far too focused on helping some salamander thing gently vomit what I assume to be its kids into a river. That last thing happens in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSWnnQMSPjc&amp;t=126s">this trailer</a> at around the 1:15 mark, lest you accuse me of ruining your day with made up tales of water-based creatures blowing chunks.</p>
<p>It's sad that this and dev testimonies are how Everwild's mysteries'll be uncovered, rather than by folks who've fired up a complete game, but such is the nature of projects which never see the light of day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucials-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb-2000634496</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crucial%E2%80%99s-x10-4tb-portable-ssd-returns-to-its-prime-day-low-after-a-brief-price-hike-only-0-05-per-gb.1323433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s rare that a tech deal approaches perfection as closely as this one that’s just popped up at Amazon. That might sound hyperbolic, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">but how else would you describe this all-time low price on the Crucial X10 4TB SSD,</a> which is one of the most complete portable drives in terms of physical size (tiny and lightweight), memory (huge), and speed (blazing)?</p>
<p>Amazon’s dropped the price on this all-star portable hard drive by 39% to an unprecedented $240. The Crucial X10’s appeal is multiplied when you take into account that it’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, Linux, and gaming consoles. Need more? It’s also IP65 dust and water resistant, and probably most importantly of all considering it’s modest size, the Crucial X10 is also drop-resistant up to nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Something for Everyone</h2>
<p>When a portable SSD has nearly universal compatibility to go along with all of its many outstanding features, it also gains nearly universal appeal. Creative professionals like photo and video shooters and editors love the massive 4TB capacity, but they might love the truly outstanding 2,100MB/s read and 2,000MB/s write speeds that blast through even the biggest files in no time flat. The size and speed also make it a perfect source of extra storage for gaming consoles, and anyone just looking for a big, fast, reliable drive that will keep everything backed up and won’t take over their desk space will be thrilled by the Crucial X10.</p>
<p>Who else is this drive designed for? Students, for sure, since it’s big enough to keep all of those important files backed up and safe while also taking up next to no backpack space. Families with thousands of irreplaceable digital photos and home videos can fit all of them in the generous 4TB capacity of the Crucial X10 to keep them safe. The better question is, who isn’t the Crucial X10 designed for?</p>



<h2>Deal Become Steal</h2>
<p>While you’re more than welcome to keep the Crucial X10 on your desk fulltime, or keep it in a drawer to pull out for regular backups, it’s practically begging to be taken on the go. It’s <em>really</em> small — 2.55 inches wide by 1.96 long by 0.39 thick, and a truly ridiculous 1.13&nbsp;<em>ounces</em> — not pounds. It’s literally pocket-sized, or an ideal addition to a camera bag.</p>
<p>The 4TB version of the Crucial X10 portable drive — it’s also available in 1TB, 2TB, 6TB, and 8TB versions — normally sells for $396, and to be honest, that’s a very fair price for a compact, fast, reliable portable hard drive that’s also tough enough to take a good-sized drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">This 39% off deal at Amazon is the biggest one ever for this highly rated drive, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $240.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> chief Randy Pitchford has said that if other developers better understood why gamers love making decisions about loot, Gearbox would have “good competitors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford was speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m7sd7y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> to discuss the release of Borderlands 4 and Gearbox’s journey alongside the series’ success. The outspoken developer said that even though the Borderlands franchise will break through 100 million units sold with Borderlands 4 (publisher 2K Games has yet to announce a sales figure), he insisted “we suck!” because that 100 million is but a drop in the ocean that is the total number of potential gamers globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our mission is to entertain the world,” Pitchford said. “Which means we suck! Because there are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. Borderlands, with 4, we’re gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That’s awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we’re just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been working on Borderlands for over 20 years now. And it feels like we’re starting to get pretty good at it. It feels like we’re starting to figure it out. I feel like we’ve probed a lot of the end points. But I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of a journey.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/gettyimages-2165642737-1760354699644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has thoughts about the looter shooter genre. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford then entered into a rather philosophical debate about why people love looter shooters like Borderlands so much. This is a game that revolves around the hunt for better loot — in the case of Borderlands 4 billions of potential weapons are available — and players fuss over whether to equip something new that’s just dropped or stick with what they already have, even if it’s inferior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a constant loop in the Borderlands games, which are packed with enemies, crates, chests, and even toilets that spit out loot. Perhaps to a greater extent than any other looter shooter, loot is everywhere in Borderlands, and the player is constantly having to pause to wonder, is that item that just dropped worth my time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, the answer is no. But sometimes the answer is yes. Either way, as you play Borderlands and fuss over the minutiae of your build, you're always asking yourself whether this item or that item will help make the numbers go up within your playstyle. Farming for these items is all part of the loot hunt and, for so many millions of fans, the whole reason to play Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Coincidentally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands games are tuned to present these sorts of loot conundrums “by design,” Pitchford explained, before saying he expected the franchise to have more imitators by now because of how addictive this loop is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re poking at some fundamentals, which is part of why I think Borderlands as a game has worked, and does work, and why it’s a very delicate design that I think is one of the reasons why there haven’t really been many successful imitators since we first showed how a shooter looter could work with the original game,” Pitchford said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands doesn’t have the looter shooter genre to itself, of course. Perhaps its most high-profile rival is Bungie’s Destiny, although that Sony-owned franchise has seen better days. Other examples include People Can Fly’s Outriders (no sequel in sight), and Ubisoft’s The Division (The Division 3 is in the works). If we’re stretching the definition of looter shooter, we might include games like Warframe, Remnant 2, or The First Descendant. Rocksteady’s disastrous Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is perhaps the most high-profile of looter shooter failures. Certainly, Borderlands and its various entries dominate the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it all comes down to nailing the “gratifying” decision around loot in Borderlands. It is something, Pitchford said, humans love to do because it scratches an itch in our brains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That decision, that choice about, do I keep what I have or do I try the new thing? That is a very compelling, fundamental, both need and skill that our brains have, to make choices like that,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve reduced it down to this simple moment with this interface in this system. It’s a gratifying loop. It’s a gratifying decision. Our brains need to do it, and our brains like doing it. And we’re better off when we do it. The more we exercise that muscle, not just in the video game but literally in life — this is what separates our species from a lot of others, and how we developed language and how we developed all kinds of high levels of consciousness and cognition that allow us to analyse the world. Most of what our prefrontal cortex is for — why that adaptation exists and what it’s used for — is that skill, or versions of it. We’ve reduced it down into this design. And yes — the is the thing I’m looking at better than the thing I’ve got, and managing the cognition between the objective, almost scientific analysis of that choice, versus the emotional impact on that choice, and having those at odds with each other frequently, is very interesting, and dare I say it addictive.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford continued: “We don’t do it because it’s addictive. We do it because it’s stimulating and because we kind of need that. Part of why games exist are to… yeah. we can live a fantasy that we might not be able to have in the real world, and we can explore themes and ideas in a safe place that we can’t explore in the real world, but we also can, because it’s an interactive simulation, we can test our thinking and our decision making and put our brain to work in really interesting ways that we kind of need and want.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the puzzlement that other developers haven’t taken Borderlands on at its own game, and the associated suggestion that Gearbox’s rivals aren’t thinking about the looter shooter on the same level as the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we’d have more competitors, or we’d have good competitors,” he said. “But we haven’t so far. It’s weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they’re not thinking about it on that level. They’re just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It’s not a designer’s or creator’s drive that’s doing it. It’s either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you’re not kind of drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s so weird. I fully expected after the first game came out that everyone would be hip to exactly what you mentioned, and we’d immediately see lots of other games imitating and aping, and we’d be dead, because we can’t compete with a lot of other folks, especially back then. We were the scrappy underdogs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the critical reception to Borderlands 4 suggests Gearbox has once again successfully presented a looter shooter that ticks all the right boxes. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dataminer-unearths-evidence-to-suggest-a-much-maligned-borderlands-3-character-was-cut-and-replaced-late-in-development"><u>a Borderlands 4 dataminer unearthed evidence to suggest that one of the most hated characters from Borderlands 3 was cut and replaced relatively late in development</u></a>. 2K Games and Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

I’d also say we don’t see a great number of five-color preconstructed decks, but we’re literally getting one in Lorwyn Eclipsed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four turtles, plus Splinter?

Last week, however, a Japanese-speaking user on X questioned whether it was realistic or even possible for Atsu to draw a very long sword from her back, prompting a flood of video comments from traditional Japanese martial arts practitioners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ghost of Yotei, you’ll pick up the Odachi (literally ‘big sword’) in The Way of the Odachi quest (check out our walkthrough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ghost-of-yotei/The_Way_of_the_Odachi_Walkthrough"><u>here</u></a>). It is a useful addition to Atsu’s arsenal, especially when facing off against larger enemies (brutes). It allows her to block heavy attacks and then push back against the opponent, opening them up for a devastating slice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she already has two swords at her hip, Atsu opts to sheath the Odachi on her back, however X user ikazombie questioned how on earth you’d pull this off without dislocating something. Upon slowing the clip down, they realised that you could theoretically draw and sheath it from over your left shoulder, but seemed unconvinced about how this would be accomplished in real life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">大太刀、あんなデカい刀を背負ってどうやって抜刀すんねん関節外れるぞと思ってたんだけど、予想外のモーションで ” 理 論 上 は ” 問題なく抜刀/納刀できてたの笑う<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/j31VjGpgDk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j31VjGpgDk</a></p>— ジェット・リョー (@ikazombie) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikazombie/status/1974771283360645536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese martial arts practitioners commented with videos. User Harima_mekkai (a member of the Tenshinryu school) decided to try out Atsu’s way of wearing and drawing an Odachi. She posted a video of herself successfully unsheathing a 1m long sword weighing 1.5kg from over her left shoulder. This shows that the drawing part of Atsu's Odachi technique is actually doable, albeit it takes effort and training to pull it off that smoothly.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— まーこ　11月29日生誕祭🎂 (@harima_mekkai) <a href="https://twitter.com/harima_mekkai/status/1975527448180891946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another user by the name of Lornplum replied with a video of himself drawing and sheathing a back-mounted sword and described the way Atsu deals with the length by holding the blade as she draws it as a "brilliant touch of realism." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">刀身持って長さを稼ぐやり方としては絶妙なリアリティ<br>現実でやるならこういうかんじ<a href="https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq</a></p>— lornplum (@lornplum) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornplum/status/1974791334272921826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch did get members of the Tenshinryu school to do motion capture for the sword fights and stances in Ghost of Yotei. Tenshinryu is a traditional Japanese martial art which dates from the 1600s and covers the art of a wide variety of weapons, including spears, swords and chain sickles.

The clips of real-life pros show them moving the sheath up and over their shoulder more (or even <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1974797905312813146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>around their body</u></a>) to make it easier to draw and sheath the weapon. This is especially apparent when sheathing the sword. It seems that the amount of movement in Atsu’s Odaichi sheathing was reduced, likely to make whipping out and holstering the weapon smoother and more responsive for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Lornplum <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1975554349884690691" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented </u></a>on Harima_Mekkai’s demonstration of drawing a Odaichi Atsu-style: “As you can see, with some effort anyone can manage to draw it, however sheathing it (like Atsu does) is pretty much impossible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they look cool in games, it goes without saying that having a sword on your back in real life makes it much more awkward to access than if it was at your hip. Last year, a Link cosplayer found it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-helps-zelda-cosplayer-struggling-to-unsheathe-links-sword-by-explaining-how-it-works-in-smash-bros"><u>impossible to unsheath their back-mounted sword</u></a> Breath of the Wild-style. However, they received a bit of unexpected advice from none other than Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai, who explained that they made Link’s sword skills a little more realistic for Smash Bros. Ultimate by having him move the scabbard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a> returned an 8/10.

            <p>Alright readers, here’s the bad news: the Maw ate Edwin. I know, it’s unfortunate, but we all saw it coming. You can’t feed a Stygian horror nothing but PC game releases and expect it to simply forget about protein. The <em>good</em> news is that the Maw isn’t a particularly thorough masticator, so I imagine Edwin will have clambered back out by, ooh, say, Wednesday. Like that episode of the Samurai Jack reboot, except he spends even more time in a loincloth.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>No field battle-sized megagames this week, but there is another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> launching later today, Monday 13th October. That means demos: free demos, loads of demos, far too many demos, dear God how did you people make so many demos. Who’s got a game they’re hoping to see demo-fied? I continue waiting in quiet, some might say blind hope that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> emerges from its years of silence. But we’ll see.</p>
<h2>Monday 13th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891020/Undusted_Letters_from_the_Past/">Undusted: Letters from the Past</a> is a breezy object restoration game in which you polish, scrub, and mini-vacuum old tat to learn the stories of its owners.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386750/Spindle/">Spindle</a>, a pixelly action-adventure, casts you as Death in a world where nobody’s dying. That leaves plenty of time to go fishing and tend to your pet pig, mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 14th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Mohrta</a> is a free-roaming fantasy FPS with an abundance of Morrowind-y weirdness.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527820/Chickenhare_and_the_treasure_of_SpikingBeard/">Chickenhare and the Treasure of Spiking-Beard</a> is clearly going for 2000’s 3D platformer charm, and looks family-friendly almost to a fault.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 15th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/">Ball X Pit</a> would like one of every genre, please. It’s a Breakout-influenced survival schmup (with, to be fair, amusingly chaotic bouncy-ball projectiles) that ties in base-building and is, of course, a roguelike.</li>
<li>Anarchic comedy adventure<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/"> GlitchSPANKR</a> seems a bit loud for me, though I support more developers making Jazzpunk-style jokefests.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1830320/Lords_of_Ravage/">Lords of Ravage</a> has you playing the baddie, namely a commander of mishmashed monster units you’ll be pitting against heroes in turn-based battles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 16th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, a co-operative fantasy dungeon raider (sans MMO grinding), launches into early access.</li>
<li>Quacking parody <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape from Duckov</a> replaces Tarkov’s extraction shooting and gross imperial undercurrents with silly vibes and twin-stick-style, purely PvE action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 17th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2852760/This_Is_No_Cave/">This Is No Cave</a>. Then what is it? A single-button, high-speed grapply platformer, apparently.</li>
<li>Double Fine’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043580/Keeper/">Keeper</a> lets you play – finally – as a lighthouse with legs. Looks a bit linear, but previews suggest this has some pretty clever puzzling, often involving the scraggly bird who’s perched atop your bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d say this was a quiet week before we somehow get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> all within a two-day window, but there’s no such thing as a quiet Next Fest week. It’s just... Christ, demos. <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s two-day sales even Prime Big Deals Days just ended. On October 7 and October, you could find crazy good deals all across the giant online retailer’s website covering pretty much every category of products. Even though the even is over, you can still find a ton of great opportunities to save. If you’re a photographer or videographer, you can elevate their game when shooting with a gimbal stabilizer. This RS 3 Mini 3-axis gimbal from DJI is still on sale past Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4727/"> It’s normally listed tat $237, but right now Amazon has it cut down by 20%. That shaves off $48, bring what you pay down to just $189.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wide-Ranging Compatibility</h2>
<p>This isn’t a gimbal designed for use with phones. This is professional-grade gear made with shooting on a DSLR camera in mind. With its strong high-torque motors, the DJI RS 3 Mini can support a load capacity of up to 4.4 lbs. (or 2kg). It works with a number of Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, and Fujifilm cameras. Check out the product page for the full list of models to see if your specific camera is compatible.</p>
<p>The gimbal implements a pro-level RS stabilization algorithm to keep your shot from shakings even when shooting at low angles or when filming in flashlight mode. It supports native vertical shooting, great for when creating content to be used on social media. The quick-release plate can just be set to the vertical arm and you’re good to go.</p>



<p>The handle on the DJI RS 3 Mini gimbal stabilizer has a number of controls built into the handle including a Bluetooth shutter control. Once you’ve paired it the first time, your camera will automatically connect when both are one and close by. From there, you can easily control photo capture, video recording, and even zoom right from the gimbal controls.</p>
<p>Designed to be portable, the stabilizer is light and small so you can easily store it into you bag. The whole gimbal only weighs 1.75 lbs. (or 795g).</p>
<p>Battery life is long-lasting. You’ll get a full 10 hours of shooting done off a single charge. When reaches 0%, you can get it back up to full after just 2.5 hours of charging.</p>
<p>Included with the gimbal, you receive a couple of mounting screws, a USB-charging cable, an L-shaped Multi-camera control cable (USB-C), the RS mini quick release plate, and an RS mini tripod. The last one can be screwed into the bottom of the gimbal for when you need a stationary shot.</p>

            <p>Black Myth Wukong is getting an update today, 13th October, across all platforms. It's a relatively minor update that fixes bugs and introduces some performance optimisations, but it requires so much space on PlayStation 5 that some players might struggle to install it.</p>
<p>You'll need approximately 93.5GB of free storage space for the update on PS5. As <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1977192496716517644">the Black Myth X account</a> explains: "Due to differences in file storage methods, the patch on PS5 will require a relatively large amount of space (approximately 93.5 GB)."</p>

<p>Given that the original game already occupies ~130GB of storage, adding another ~90GB gives a total of 210GB, which is a sizable chunk of an 825GB standard PS5 storage drive (especially when you consider there's about 667GB of working storage after system files are installed). If you struggle to find the space, it might be simpler to delete the entire game and redownload it.</p>
<p>"If the update cannot be completed due to insufficient storage or other reasons, you may continue playing the current version or try deleting the game and redownloading it," said the Black Myth X account.</p>
<p>Why would that work? Because you're not getting 90GB's worth of new content, you're likely redownloading a reordered file structure of the game - redownloading the game, effectively. Better to do it in one 93.5GB lump than doubling up, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Incidentally, PC players, note your mods - this patch might cause some compatibility issues with them. If it does, uninstall the mods and wait for them to be separately updated.</p>

<p>Black Myth Wukong was a huge success for maker Game Science when it launched last year, selling more than 10m copies despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">lukewarm reviews</a>. But more than that, it was a success for Chinese-made games. It seems to be to them what The Witcher was for Polish games: a pace-maker, a trend-setter, an attention- grabber, as Ed found out when he investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the rise of Chinese-made blockbuster games</a> recently.</p><p>Naturally, the game's success has also fuelled development of more Black Myth game experiences at Game Science, though we're not getting a direct sequel but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a thematic continuation based around another mythical Chinese figure, Zhong Kui</a>. There's no release date for it yet.</p>

<p>Well here's something that we weren't expecting. Fresh out of New York Comic Con 2025, we got our first peek at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/avatar-legends-the-fighting-game">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</a> (working title), an upcoming one-on-one fighter heading to Switch 2 in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't know all that much about what this one will have in store just yet — heck, the title will almost certainly change in the next 12 months — but the pre-alpha footage is looking pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Avatar Legends will see a roster of fighters from the immensely popular <strong>Last Airbender</strong> and <strong>Legend of Korra</strong> series face off in the ring. We can expect a good bit of elemental combat to keep things feeling fresh, and there's set to be a line-up of support characters for an extra pinch of customisation.</p>
<p>Throw in a single player campaign for good measure, and wrap it all up in a hand-drawn visual style reminiscent of the original anime, and we've got a pretty interesting looking fighter on our hands.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 12 Playable Characters at launch, with many more released via Season Model<br>
- Selectable support characters influence your fighting style and grant special moves<br>
- Unique “Flow System” w/Movement Centric Gameplay<br>
- Single Player Campaign w/Original Narrative<br>
- Combo TrialsGallery Mode<br>
- Best in Class Net Code and Cross Play</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still a lot more for us to learn about this one in the coming months, but the promise of a Switch 2 release has us intrigued.</p>
