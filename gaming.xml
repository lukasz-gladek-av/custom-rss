<p>It also made the "Top 10 Best-Selling Games" of last month</p>

<p>It's a new year, and following new releases in January 2026, Circana's Mat Piscatella has now shared chart data for the "Top 10 Best-Selling Premium Games" on Nintendo platforms in the US for this same month.</p>
<p>As you can see, Square Enix's latest Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> has debuted in second place, below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Keep in mind Nintendo's first-party titles here do not factor in the digital sales, and these charts do not include specific sales data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c1e00b021caf"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c1e00b021caf/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Mat Piscatella / Circana</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake also went from 225th place in December to 9th place in January - cracking the "Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games" in the US for January 2026. This was thanks to the combined efforts of the Switch 2 and Xbox releases. Pokémon Legends: Z-A has dropped from sixth place to 16th place in the "Top 20" this month.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e096691b52300"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e096691b52300/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Mat Piscatella / Circana</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Piscatella has provided some additional information about hardware performance, revealing Switch 2 spending was able to offset year-on-year declines across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Switch. In saying this, PlayStation 5 still led the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hardware spending increased 16% when compared to a year ago, reaching $248M. Nintendo Switch 2 spending was able to offset year-on-year declines seen across PlayStation 5 (-17%), Xbox Series (-27%) and Switch (-79%).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Despite sales falling compared to a year ago, PlayStation 5 led the hardware market in both unit and dollar sales during January 2026. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd across both measures."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> recently got a release date for the Switch 2. There's also a demo you can check out for the first game via the Switch eShop, and if you want to know even more about it, be sure to read (or watch) our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebration, Nintendo officially lifted the lid on the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>.</p>
<p>They're arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, and ahead of this release, Nintendo has shared not only an official trailer but also some direct screenshots, showing off how both games will look on its hybrid system.</p>
<p>As we previously mentioned, Nintendo has also confirmed these Switch releases contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, with some modern solutions to the connectivity features. You can also play these titles while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>If you somehow haven't played these monster-catching RPG before, as you can see below, it's a mix of adventure, exploration and battling wrapped up in some lovely pixel artwork! So, without further ado, here's a look:</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/iron-lung-film-composer-andrew-hulshult-on-working-with-markiplier-differences</link>
            <guid>1442902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Andrew Hulshult: For many boomer shooter fans, he's known as <em>THE </em>guy for soundtracks in that genre. When his name flashed on the screen during the opening credits of <em>Iron Lung</em>, I was surprised to learn one of my favorite composers was involved with this project. As the credits rolled at the end of the film, the gears started whirring in my head: I really want to talk to him about this film's soundtrack.</p><p>As it turns out, going from strictly video game OSTs to film was as unexpected for Hulshult as it was for me finding out he composed for <em>Iron Long. </em>And so, after asking around, I was able to talk to the man himself and learn more about his process of composing for film versus video games, the challenges he faced, and the fun he had while on <em>Iron Lung</em>'s set.&nbsp;</p><h2>On the Set of <em>Iron Lung</em></h2><p>Unless you're deep into the boomer shooter space, you might not know of Hulshult's connection to <em>Iron Lung </em>game creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/david-szymanski" rel="nofollow">David Szymanski</a>. The film wasn't their first creative endeavor together -- Hulshult composed the soundtrack for the gritty, dark, retro-style shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dusk-review-dawn-of-old-era" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, the very game that put Szymanski on the map.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 2018 or 2019, after <em>Dusk</em>'s development, Hulshult would often casually tell Szymanski that it would be cool to do a score for a film, if the chance ever arose. While we don't have a movie for <em>Dusk </em>(at least, not yet), around 2022, Hulshult got a call from Szymanski about a <em>different </em>project.</p><p>"He called me and was like, 'hey, you remember how you said you wanted to work on a film?' He's like, 'so what if I told you you could and that I think that you'd be perfect for it?' And I was like, I'm thinking [it's a] small thing, 'I'm like... yeah, what do you got.' He's like, well, Markiplier."</p><picture>

  </picture><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_YxT-KID8kRbqZo7MyscQ" rel="nofollow">Markiplier</a> is a massive presence on YouTube and beyond. With nearly 40 million subscribers on YouTube alone, anything with his name behind it pulls a lot of weight. Even while writing this article, he's streaming a horror game and pulling a staggering 90,000 viewers. So, for him to be involved, Hulshult knew it was a big deal, and was eager to jump into this project, that being <em>Iron Lung.</em></p><p>"It was sick, man, like it was so much fun," said Hulshult. "That guy is a constant creative, is always looking for something to better the project without going too crazy into it, is always open to ideas, is always looking for suggestions, and it's just been awesome."</p><p>Hulshult later had a chance to visit the set of <em>Iron Lung, </em>where he was able to get inspiration and ideas for the music. For about a minute, he felt like an outsider on set, but almost immediately, he grew comfortable with the professionalism and friendliness of the crew.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Not to mention, Hulshult was blown away by the dynamic set -- a sub rigged into a machine that could create the feeling of underwater turbulence -- and seeing it all in action over the course of a week served as incredible inspiration for his music.</p><p>"It was awesome to be asked to come on the set just to write demos. And I will tell you that about half the demos I wrote under that, I never touched again, and they just made it into the film. We just liked them. I was just catching vibes off of Mark's acting that I was like, I genuinely did not think that I would catch. I was connecting with that dude's performances on a different level."</p><p>Aspects from the set made it into Hulshult's music, as well. Giant vats of artificial blood, latex, metal, and even Markiplier's own voice contributed to the score. By sampling these sounds, Hulshult worked some dark magic and created the ominous, brooding sounds we hear in the <em>Iron Lung</em> OST.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I was just catching vibes off of Mark's acting that I was like, I genuinely did not think that I would I would catch I was I was connecting with that dude's performances on a different level.</p></blockquote><p>"And I would feed in all of those sounds into granular synthesis," said Hulshult, "and just mess with them until I found something that sounded like a note that I enjoyed, but still sounded like, you know, metal or a sub or Mark's voice. And then I would just use it, and it kind of became like a little bit of a meme where I was like, I'm going to go home and write music with this metallic shitty orchestra for this film, is what we always say."</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Composing for Video Games vs. Film</h2><p>At various points during our talk, we touched on the differences between composing for video game music versus film. Hulshult has credits for over a dozen games, including the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dusk-review-dawn-of-old-era" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, but also the recent <em>Heretic + Hexen</em> Remaster by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive</a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em>'s</a> <em>The Ancient Gods </em>DLC.</p><p>"You can't operate this the exact same way," said Hulshult. "You can't come to it the exact same way. You have to come to it and talk about the vision, like what this guy's vision is, and understand it to a point where you don't even need him in the room, which I feel like I got to that. And every time that I would have a piece of music, I just sent it over to him, and he loved almost all of it all the way through, which I was like, thank god, it's my first time. This could have gone so sideways."</p><p>Because of Hulshult's experience in the industry, he mentions there is an established trust between him and the video game producers he works with. Of course, video games and film are completely different forms of entertainment, which was one hurdle he had to get around.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>"...so like films, it is a lot more static, but the the issue with films is that they can change, so you can get cuts, right? Like something can completely change in a week, and you've got to rethink it. And with games, it's not so much that. It's like, this is the level, this is how we want to do stuff. So you can kind of write what's in your head front to back, almost all in one go."</p><p>One distinct aspect about <em>Iron Lung</em> is that it takes place completely within one self-contained submarine, whereas Hulshult is normally composing for video games with sprawling levels and dynamic themes. This was intimidating, especially given the fact that music was critical in creating the atmosphere for the film.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been a while since I had like a really good challenge," said Hulshult. "<em>Eternal </em>felt like a really good challenge, those DLC felt like a really good challenge, and I think I was ready for another big challenge and that's what excited me about this."</p><blockquote><p>I think I was ready for another big challenge and that's what excited me about this.</p></blockquote><p>Hulshult commends the cinematography and editing of the film, making use of such a small space to constantly innovate and thus keep the audience engaged. In addition to the excellent work by Markiplier as director and his team, <em>Iron Lung</em> game creator David Szymanski served a pivotal role in the process as well.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Szymanski not only developed the gameplay for <em>Iron Lung</em>, he also created the music as well. For research, Hulshult went back and listened to Szymanski's work, which he calls "weird, interesting and really dreadful."&nbsp;</p><p>There was a particular motif from the theme song of <em>Iron Lung </em>that stuck with him, and curious about how Szymanski created a certain whirring sound, Hulshult was shocked to learn it was sampled by an old fan.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>"And that changed how I perceived everything with the soundtrack," said Hulshult, "that little tiny interaction with David Szymanski, because I was sitting back here going, 'I'm about to write like music for a movie -- I gotta go find all these crazy string libraries and we gotta go find the coolest synths that we can, we're going to go spend some money.</p><p>And immediately was like, nope: We're going to work on sound design, is what we're going to do. We're going to find weird sounds that are related to either the set or the sub, and we're going to write with that."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Unprecedented Reception of <em>Iron Lung</em></h2><p><em>Iron Lung</em>'s film adaptation has been nothing short of a rousing success. With a smaller budget of $3 million and created by a YouTuber -- not an established director -- <em>Iron Lung's </em>accrued nearly $50 million in revenue. In a heartfelt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcJWymZ1x9o" rel="nofollow">tear-filled video</a> by Markiplier, he reflects on the film's monumental performance.

' And they're in the theater. And I'm just, I really wanted to write back: 'Please just watch the movie, send it to me afterwards.'"</p><p><span title="Play starting at 26:47" data-start="1607410" data-end="1611950">"Anytime I can be a part of something cool with cool people and people want to talk </span><span title="Play starting at 26:52" data-start="1611950" data-end="1616270">about it for a few years down the road, I'm all for it, t</span><span title="Play starting at 26:56" data-start="1616310" data-end="1618590">hat's what it is for me.

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend Of Zelda’s Keeps Flirting With Dumping Fantasy For Sci-Fi]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-sci-fi-concept-art-40th-anniversary-2000672580</link>
            <guid>1442899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today marks the 40th anniversary of </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>. Originally released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986, Nintendo’s ambitious adventure kicked off the most beloved high-fantasy video game series of them all. Through decades, the tunic-wearing hero has slain stalfos, obliterated octoroks, and harassed cuccos. But behind all the sword and sorcery lies another campaign in waiting, an adventure Link has never braved but come very close to undertaking: some outer space shit.</span></p> <p><span>In 2017, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, art director Satoru Takizawa and technical director Takuhiro Dohta </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc"><span>gave a keynote at GDC</span></a><span>. It offered a rare and candid glimpse at the production behind the latest (and to some, greatest) </span><i><span>Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>, released only a few days prior. Getting a peak behind the curtain at how the toybox of physics and elemental effects came to be was a treat, but one of the more bizarre parts of the talk regarded an earlier pitch.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a segment called “Trial and Error,” Takizawa reviews concepts for a version of the game called <em>The Legend of Zelda: INVASION</em>. “This is where things got a bit dodgy,” Takizawa said. “And here’s an invasion from outer space.”</span></p> <p><span>As chuckling swells in the crowd, bizarre slides of this would-be </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> cycle. It features a UFO descending on to Hyrule, a storyboard for an alien autopsy, spacesuits and Ganondorf in what appears to be a Metallica t-shirt. Most offensive of all were slides of the most fuckboy Link ever developed. Dressed like a frosh week volunteer, Link dons baggy denim pants, a striped winter hat, a Triforce guitar and a motorcycle. To think we came this close to a Link with a </span><i><span>Superbad</span></i><span> poster in his room still gives me chills.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfefbrnvn32w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia5cy4hgcgd5aosdhkyvbjbew2mpr72ppojm5jvkofahie7z6mkgq"> <p lang="fr">The Legend of Zelda is 40 today 🤯<br> *check notes on space*</p> <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017): UFO concept, artist unknown<br> Art director Satoru Takizawa: "Some of our younger designers came up with very unique suggestions, like the idea that UFOs could invade from space and abduct cattle.”</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz?ref_src=embed">The Spaceshipper 🚀 (@thespaceshipper.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:so362smrcoypah6gusrtkqvz/post/3mfefbrnvn32w?ref_src=embed">2026-02-21T10:15:00.535Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>Thankfully we got the incredible game we got instead, but it’s probably no coincidence that Takizawa brought up <em>INVASION</em> when discussing the design for </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>’s ancient ruins and Guardians. Sheikah technology has a strong, otherworldly and out-of-place appearance to it. Mechanical octopus arms. Ominous glowing spotlights. Metallurgy so distant to the masonry everywhere else. Hell, Link’s main weapon is a damn smartphone. It always felt like some of the sci-fi elements remained deep in Hyrule’s soil, built by ancient visitors.</span></p>

 <p><span>This </span><i><span>Stargate</span></i><span>-aside wasn’t </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span>’s only near miss with a different genre. Fact is, since day one Shigeru Miyamoto considered giving </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> a harder sci-fi bent. In </span><a href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/interview-miyamoto-un-equilibre-difficile-a-trouver-165131.html"><span>an interview with the French publication </span><i><span>Gamekult</span></i></a><span>, Miyamoto confirmed that the series’ original idea revolved around time travel.</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously time travel is a frequent occurrence, but this initial concept is less </span><i><span>Ocarina</span></i><span> and more </span><i><span>Back to the Future Part II</span></i><span>. This plot seemingly concerns a bygone era of steel and shield rubbing up against strange future devices, and the source of the Triforce’s incredible magic being microchips and computer parts. In that same conversation, Miyamoto even muses that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> producer Eiji Aonuma might have added the Sheikah Slate as a kind of callback to this original idea. 1992’s </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> got so close to Link facing off against flying cars that concept art was drafted for a tubular, ‘90s, cyberpunk Princess Zelda, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216074731/https://kotaku.com/5979669/your-favorite-zelda-game-could-have-looked-like-this"><span>resurfacing in 2013’s </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i></a><span>. Come to think of it, the title </span><i><span>A Link to the Past</span></i><span> would make a lot more sense for a game about time travel than one in which you merely hop between a good dimension and a scary dimension.</span></p> <p><span>After 40 years, it feels unlikely that Nintendo will send Link, Zelda, Tingle, all our Hyrule friends spiraling into wormholes and far off nebulas now. When Hylians land on the moon, it usually means the moon came to the Hyrule. Nintendo has reigned in their style guide before. As they venture </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854"><span>into movies</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373"><span>Netflix shows</span></a><span> and theme parks I expect them to only become more conservative on what their IPs do and do not do. Still, as much as <em>INVASION</em>’s Link… disturbs me, I am that steadfast </span><i><span>Jackie Brown</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ed Wood</span></i><span> are their best movies kind of hack who finds that great artists often do their greatest work beyond the comfort zone. Throughout the ages, people who work on <em>Zelda</em> seem to dream of one day lobbing Link into the cold void of space. Perhaps, one day, they will get their wish.</span></p>

<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma discusses what she likes in video games. She also admits she’s got a lot to learn in her new role.</p>



<p>Asha Sharma became the head of Xbox on February 20, 2026, following a shake-up that saw Phil Spencer retire and Sarah Bond leave the company. She’s tried to be an engaging CEO in her first 24 hours, outlining her<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai/" id="178392"> vision for AI in Xbox’s future</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">responding to gamers on social media</a>. Still, her background at Microsoft saw her leading the CoreAI division.</p>



<p>Before Microsoft, she held top positions for Instacart and Meta. While those are successful companies, they don’t exactly scream “gaming.” As such, Sharma knows she has a lot to learn in her new position.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-on-what-she-likes-to-see-in-video-games">Asha Sharma on What She Likes to See in Video Games</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma was quoted as saying that she likes games with deep emotional resonance. She also touted the game Firewatch as a game that resonated with her emotionally.</p>



<p>Sharma plans to win over core Xbox gamers and earn the right to be trusted. She hopes to develop consistency over time that will lead to a stronger relationship with the player base. “I’m coming into gaming as a platform builder,” Sharma noted.</p>



<p>In response to a social media comment, she even listed her three favorite games: Halo, Valheim, and GoldenEye.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Moving forward, she will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-booty-full-memo-following-promotion-to-cco-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178377">work closely with Matt Booty</a> to enact her initiatives. Sarah Bond will assist her and provide guidance during the transition before her exit from Microsoft.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 will once again include MyFACTION, a single-player mode that competes with NBA 2K’s MyTeam and EA Sports FC’s Ultimate Team. It offers a collection-oriented experience centered on in-game trading cards. </p>



<p>Players start with a specific pack of wrestlers and then use in-game points or virtual currency to purchase new packs that improve their team.</p>



<p>As with most sports and live-service games in 2026, microtransactions are part of the experience. In the case of WWE games, microtransactions will allow you to get a specific card of a specific player needed for a specific event. Now, the team behind the mode is discussing their philosophy on microtransactions in MyFACTION.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-designer-says-they-try-to-provide-extra-benefits-for-players-who-pay-for-myfaction-content">WWE 2K26 Designer Says They Try To Provide Extra Benefits for Players Who Pay for MyFACTION Content</h2>



<p>Interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wwe-2k26-myfaction-interview-talking-microtransactions-and-mixed-gender-matches-with-the-popular-modes-leads/">VGC</a>, Terrell Carter, MyFACTION’s lead designer, explains that he and the team try to give players an extra benefit for spending real-world money.</p>



<p>Internally, the hope is that they don’t make players feel they have to make purchases like that to use any of the game’s features. Still, if the purchase is made, they want them to feel there is as much upside as possible.</p>



<p>“So we try to give more content based on those things, rather than be ultra restrictive. Hopefully, it doesn’t feel ultra-restrictive to the players,” he said.</p>







<h2>Team Chemistry is A Major Feature in This Year’s MyFACTION Mode</h2>



<p>2K recently announced that a new mechanic called team chemistry would be a major focal point of this year’s MyFACTION. With 60 in-game traits that can have positive and negative effects on your team, there are plenty of scenarios that will play out depending on your specific team’s chemistry.</p>



<p>For example, Carter says that if your team has bad chemistry, it could fall apart when Partners refuse to tag each other. Luckily, there’s a way to circumvent that: a new teleport option this year that draws on fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom and places them in the WWE environment. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Toronto KOI has just secured a win after an eight-match losing streak in the Call of Duty League. The team managed to produce a huge 3-0 sweep over Minnesota G2, putting out something of a masterclass while flexing the new talent in the recently promoted Kips. The young competitor came up from Challengers, departing the Huntsmen and moving into the League.</p>



<p>It was a much-needed victory for Toronto KOI, especially in the run-up to Major II, which will take place in the United Kingdom for the first time in six years.</p>







<h2 id="h-toronto-koi-manages-to-secure-a-win">Toronto KOI Manages to Secure a Win</h2>



<p>Toronto KOI, which rebranded ahead of this season after dropping the Ultra moniker, has pulled off a sweep against Minnesota G2. The Call of Duty League has not been kind to Toronto KOI this season, and the team currently sits in 10th place in the overall season standings.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s fixture against G2 could be an indicator of things to come, now that Kips has taken up a spot on the roster after moving up from the Huntsmen. To make space for him, Reeal was pushed out.</p>



<p>Kips admitted in a post-match interview that his first series with Toronto, which was a 0-3 loss to FaZe Vegas, was him getting his feet wet. He now has a win under his belt in the Call of Duty League, and it was secured against a Minnesota side that hasn’t been performing too badly of late.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Minnesota went on something of a run at Major I in Dallas, Texas, in January. The squad pushed FaZe Vegas into the lower bracket and eliminated Miami Heretics from the tournament before falling in a <strong>very close </strong>redemption series against FaZe.</p>



<p>Toronto’s next fixture will be <strong>next Saturday </strong>against Miami Heretics, followed by a series against Paris Gentle Mates, this season’s Major I champion side. Will Toronto remain resilient?</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re enjoying the Call of Duty League this season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 – Everything We Know About Sony’s Next-Gen Console So Far]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/playstation-6-everything-we-know-release-date-specs-price-games/</link>
            <guid>1442842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p><strong>Sony</strong> hasn't officially announced the <strong>PlayStation 6</strong> yet, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning out an increasingly steady stream of leaks, insider reports, and solid hints from the company itself. With the PlayStation 5 well into the latter half of its lifecycle and the PS5 Pro already on shelves, <strong>the attention of hardcore gamers is increasingly turning toward whatever comes next</strong>. </p>



<p>Here is everything we know so far about the PlayStation 6, from its release window and hardware to pricing, design, and <strong>the possibility of an entirely new PlayStation handheld</strong> launching alongside it. Read this article <strong>with the significant caveat that most of this info is likely still in flux and may not even have been finalized by Sony itself yet</strong>. We'll continue updating this article up to the console's release whenever significant new information becomes available.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Release Date and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Sony has maintained a remarkably consistent console release cadence: the PS3 launched in 2006, the PS4 in 2013, and the PS5 in November 2020, a seemingly near-perfect seven-year gap each time. Applying that pattern to the PS5 points to a <strong>2027 release window</strong> for the PS6, and that was the most widely cited target among leakers, chiefly YouTuber <strong>Moore's Law Is Dead</strong> (<strong>MLID</strong>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renowned AMD insider <strong>KeplerL2</strong></a>. However, in January 2026, <strong>MST International</strong> senior analyst <strong>David Gibson</strong> warned that while Sony's existing memory inventory would shield it from the short-term impact of <strong>rising RAM prices</strong>, increased costs could become a serious issue in the fiscal year ending March 2027, and noted that the PS6's release is therefore "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely to be delayed longer than many expected</a></strong>." </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Then, on February 15, 2026, Bloomberg published an even more alarming report citing anonymous sources familiar with Sony's PlayStation 6 plans. The report stated that Sony is now "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029</a></strong>", still largely due to the ongoing memory shortage that has no end in sight. If true, this could mark the longest gap between PlayStation consoles to date, while also <strong>giving Microsoft a chance to capitalize on with its next Xbox console</strong>, which is still reportedly targeting a l<strong>ate 2027 release window</strong>. </p>



<p id="h-release-date-and-pricing">Pricing is one of the most uncertain aspects of the already still nebulous PS6 picture, and the RAM shortage has complicated things further. The PS5 launched at <strong>$499</strong> for the standard edition, but with rising production costs, <strong>the PS6 is highly unlikely to match that price point</strong>. Most estimates from credible sources currently place the PS6 <strong>between $500 and $600</strong>, though some industry observers have pushed that estimate <strong>as high as $700–$900</strong> depending on the memory situation and model configuration. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro's <strong>$699</strong> launch price</a> in 2024 may have been responsible for setting a new psychological ceiling for PlayStation hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-hardware-specifications">Hardware Specifications</h2>



<p id="h-hardware-specifications">Sony's continued partnership with <strong>AMD</strong> since the days of the PS4 is one of the few hardware details confirmed with high confidence. Reuters reported in September 2024 that Intel had lost out on a bid to design the PS6 chipset back in 2022, with AMD winning the contract. <strong>This makes sense from a backward-compatibility standpoint</strong>, since the PS5 and PS5 Pro are both built on custom AMD silicon.</p>



<p>Leaked specifications, primarily from the aforementioned leaks shared by MLID and Kepler_L2, point to a custom APU featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing node</strong>: <strong>TSMC N2</strong> (2nm), delivering substantial efficiency gains over the PS5's 7nm process.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD <strong>Zen 6</strong> architecture, offering a substantial leap from the Zen 2 found in both the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which should dramatically reduce the CPU bottleneck issues seen in demanding titles.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: It is expected that the PS6 will feature <strong>GDDR7 RAM</strong> offering approximately <strong>640 GB/s bandwidth</strong>, which would be <strong>a 43% increase over the PS5's 448 GB/s</strong>, though using a narrower 160-bit memory bus rather than the PS5's 256-bit bus, with the speed difference compensating for the reduced bus width. Total RAM capacity has not been reliably leaked yet.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: AMD's next-generation <strong>RDNA 5</strong> GPU architecture, which will be used by both PS6 and the next Xbox. Though, according to KeplerL2, the new PlayStation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-wont-include-full-amd-rdna-5-feature-set/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't feature the full RDNA 5 feature set</a></strong> that will be available on desktop graphics cards.</li>



<li><strong>Rasterization Performance</strong>: Multiple leaks from MLID and KeplerL2 <span>indicate roughly&nbsp;<strong>three times the rasterization performance of the base PS5</strong>, with the teraflop count rising from <strong>10.28 TFlops</strong> for the PS5 (and <strong>18.05 TFlops</strong> for</span> the PS5 Pro) to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34-40 TFlops</a></strong> for the PS6.</li>



<li><strong>Ray Tracing Performance</strong>: This is supposedly the big focus of the PlayStation 6 console. Thanks to the advancements planned for RDNA 5, <strong>ray tracing performance could increase by a massive 6-12x compared to the PlayStation 5</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of those advancements were actually co-developed by AMD and Sony through the so-called <strong>Project Amethyst, a machine learning-focused</strong> initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally announced in late 2024</a>, Project Amethyst <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a major update in October 2025</a>, when AMD unveiled three key technologies that PlayStation 6 System Architect <strong>Mark Cerny</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mark-cerny-project-amethyst-collaboration-amd-is-a-step-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practically confirmed will be in the new console</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Neural Arrays</strong>: A new approach to grouping GPU compute units so they can work together as a single AI engine, enabling better upscaling and denoising at lower cost to GPU performance. This was described as a fundamental improvement to technologies like Sony's PSSR.</li>



<li><strong>Radiance Cores</strong>: A new dedicated hardware block designed for ray and path tracing, taking full control of ray traversal (one of the most compute-heavy tasks currently handled inefficiently across shared resources) and freeing the GPU's shader cores for their primary functions. Cerny noted: <em>"There's a significant speed boost that comes from putting the traversal logic in hardware, and a further boost that comes from that hardware operating independently from the shader cores."</em></li>



<li><strong>Universal Compression</strong>: A software layer that compresses data of all types (not just specific file formats, as in current solutions) as it flows through the graphics pipeline, effectively boosting available memory bandwidth. AMD's <strong>Jack Huynh</strong>, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics Group, described memory bandwidth limitations as a key barrier to next-gen rendering techniques, and Universal Compression is intended to address that without requiring an expensive hardware memory upgrade.</li>
</ul>



<p>There's no info yet on the storage. On the connectivity side, support for the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-forum-releases-hdmi-2-2-specification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDMI 2.2 specification</a></strong> (which allows resolutions up to 10K at 120Hz, 4K at up to 480Hz, and 8K at up to 240Hz) and <strong>USB4 Version 2.0</strong> seem like a given, especially if the delay rumors turn out to be correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-handheld-project-canis">PlayStation 6 Handheld: Project "Canis"</h2>



<p>One of the most unexpected elements of the PlayStation 6 conversation is the strong rumor that <strong>Sony is planning to launch a dedicated gaming handheld</strong> alongside, or shortly after, the PS6 home console. This would be quite the surprise for PlayStation handheld fans, who had almost given up on the idea of a new handheld console after the resounding failure of the PS Vita.</p>



<p>Bloomberg first reported in 2024 that Sony was exploring a gaming handheld, internally dubbed <strong>"Project Canis."</strong> Since then, leaked AMD documentation uncovered by MLID <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>has added substantial hardware detail</strong></a>, and multiple leakers have corroborated the device's existence. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has also updated its PS5 developer kits to prioritize "<strong>Low Power Mode</strong>" support</a>, with documentation suggesting developers ensure their games can run on just eight CPU threads. Multiple sources have since interpreted this as <strong>Sony quietly preparing the software ecosystem for handheld hardware</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Project Canis Tentative Specs </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chip</strong>: Monolithic APU built on TSMC 3nm of approximately 135mm².</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 4x Zen 6c cores for games + 2x low-power Zen 6 cores dedicated to the OS. The OS offload reportedly frees roughly 20% additional CPU headroom for games.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: 16 RDNA 5 compute units, clocking around 1.20 GHz in handheld mode and 1.65 GHz when docked.</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: LPDDR5X on a 192-bit controller, with theoretical support for up to 48GB; no solid figure has been confirmed, though developers consulted on the matter suggested anything between 24 –36GB would be necessary to run next-gen games with features such as UE5's Nanite.</li>



<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Roughly half the raw rasterization power of the base PS5, but with notably stronger ray tracing performance due to the RDNA 5 architectural improvements. Docked rasterization performance could be around 0.55 – 0.75× PS5, while ray tracing could land at 1.3 – 2.6× PS5 thanks to RDNA 5's efficiency gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some PlayStation gamers have worried that the handheld could "hold back" new PlayStation 6 games, but  according to Massive Damage's Art Director Bryan Heemskerk, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-held-back-pc-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6 games are more likely to be held back by PC ports</a></strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-6-games">PlayStation 6 Games</h2>



<p>This is by far the most speculative paragraph of the whole article, at least at the time of the original publication, for a very simple reason: it's way too early, and <strong>no PS6 games have been formally announced yet</strong>. That said, we can make a few educated guesses based on the known development timelines.</p>



<p>First in line would obviously be <strong>Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet</strong>, <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>'s new sci-fi IP. It's been a long time since we got a new game from the studio (<strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> launched in June 2020), and that's largely because Naughty Dog famously <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled The Last of Us Online in December 2023</a></strong> because it didn't want to become bound to the live service development cycle. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: the Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027</a></strong>, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier. It will definitely launch on PlayStation 5, but it could be a prime candidate for a PS6 version when the PlayStation 6 eventually hits the market.</p>



<p>The same goes for most of the big games that are tentatively scheduled for 2027-2028:</p>



<ul>
<li>Creative Assembly's <strong>Alien Isolation sequel</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong></li>



<li>Cloud Chamber's <strong>BioShock 4</strong></li>



<li>Larian's <strong>Divinity</strong></li>



<li>Bethesda's <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong></li>



<li>Square Enix's <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Avalanche Software's <strong>Hogwarts Legacy 2</strong></li>



<li>4A Games' <strong>Metro Exodus sequel</strong></li>



<li>Respawn's <strong>Star Wars Jedi Part 3</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Remake</strong></li>



<li>Ubisoft's <strong>Tom Clancy's The Division 3</strong></li>



<li>Saber's <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher IV</strong></li>



<li>CD Projekt RED's + Fool Theory's <strong>The Witcher Remake</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>All these games will likely be cross-generation, offering a PlayStation 6 version with additional bells and whistles at some point. The cross-gen phenomenon <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps4-crossgen-right-and-rational-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was already huge between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a></strong>, and given current industry trends, it's only going to get larger.</p>



<p>As for true PS6-only titles, it will take a very long time for those. Maybe the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-continues-to-be-in-development-amidst-new-features-to-build-and-romances-to-figure-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Mass Effect</a></strong>, the freshly announced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-will-launch-before-2030-promises-casey-hudson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War remake trilogy</a></strong> will qualify. Needless to say, we'll slowly update this section (as with the others) once more concrete details become available. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Freshly minted <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma</a> has kicked off the newest era of Xbox leadership with an open thread on Elon Musk’s social media platform. Coming from Microsoft’s AI division, the former marketer with little experience in gaming faces a wave of skepticism from fans at the exact moment when trust in the Xbox brand has never been more challenged following waves of developer layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures.</p> <p>She began with a simple question to her influx of new gaming followers. “Top 3 greatest games ever? Why? GO” reads her <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025255912521486368">second post on X</a> since replacing outgoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">38-year Microsoft veteran Phil Spencer</a>. “For me it’s <em>Halo</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, <em>Goldeneye</em>,” she told one user. Others asked which<em> Halo</em>. An Xbox Gamertag Sharma shared with another user included playtime in both <em>Halo Infinite</em> and <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> CEO Asha Sharma has now publicly shared her Gamertag. She has a 10,860 gamerscore and seemingly only started playing on Xbox or this GT one month ago.</p> <p>She (or whomever runs the account) has played 29 games in the span of that month. <a href="https://t.co/3EMvDVLNo3">pic.twitter.com/3EMvDVLNo3</a></p> <p>— NIB (@nib95_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nib95_/status/2025279480621682906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The account has a shocking number of achievements in <em>Ball x Pit</em>, one of 2025’s breakout indie games that debuted on Game Pass. One user recommended <em>Borderlands 2</em> which Sharma said she would try. A short time later, it appeared on her recent activity list. For some it’s a sign that the executive from Meta and Instacart is engaged, accessible, and no stranger to games. Others are skeptical that it’s not all just part of some carefully and artificially curated PR rollout.</p> <p>Amid the more than one thousand responses, Sharma was asked the obvious question on most Xbox players’ minds: what about exclusives? Microsoft’s shift from fierce console war competition with Sony to actively porting its biggest franchises to PlayStation 5 has read to many long-time fans as a betrayal and, perhaps even worse, a sign that the tech giant <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">has given up on Xbox as a viable contender in the console gaming space</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hear you</p> <p>— Asha (@asha_shar) <a href="https://twitter.com/asha_shar/status/2025253764136141169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“Hi Asha Sharma, </span><span>as the new Xbox CEO I hope that you understand how important exclusive games are and how games like Halo, Forza, Gears. Fable… Created an identity for Xbox and its players becoming a key point for Xbox’s success,” wrote one player with a Gamerscore over 200,000. “Xbox games must be only on Xbox.”</span></p>

 <p>“Hear you,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The sentiment, vague and noncommittal as it was, instantly gave some hope to the diehard Xbox fans in Sharma’s mentions. Others think it’s just a cheap way to buy a little good will before Microsoft accelerates Xbox’s pivot to being just a third-party publisher or moves forward with more cuts and closures as the tech giant continues shifting all of its resources and energy into the AI race.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the informal Q&amp;A, some users on X accused Sharma’s answers of being written by a chatbot. “I don’t believe you,” wrote one person. “In fact, I think your account is an AI.” The new CEO of Xbox responded: “Beep Boop Beep Boop.”</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/midsummer-studios/" id="1480">Midsummer Studios</a> has closed, but not before giving a look at a life simulator that the team was working on.</p>



<p>The studio was founded by XCOM designer Jake Solomon, and it was Solomon who shared on social media that the studio was closing its doors but wanted to provide a look at a game called Burbank. According to Solomon, the game was a mix of The Sims and The Truman Show, the film starring Jim Carrey that focused on a man discovering that his life was a television series.</p>



<p>“We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both,” wrote Solomon. “This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he said in his post.</p>

<p>Jake Solomon later stated in a social media post that the characters in the pre-alpha trailer he shared were generated by AI. However, he insists that the studio had no intention of replacing any developers with AI.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-xcom-devs-form-midsummer-studios-to-make-next-gen-life-sim/" id="40302">The studio opened in 2024</a>, with Solomon partnering with Will Miller, the lead designer at Firaxis Games, and Leslie Birch. Less than 2 years later, it is closed. The studio launched with $6 million in funding from investors. </p>



<p>The initial press release announcing the company states that Transcend Fund led the way, with participation from Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1 Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> was an unexpected hit. Rising above the tide of urban sandboxes in 2006, the game pushed its tomfoolery further than even </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> dared. The most recent entry, however, was a misfire. 2022’s reboot was busted from a technical standpoint and tonally out of sync for fans. Last year, rumors arose that the series might get another shot, but Chris Stockman, design director for the original game, now says the long-running </span><i><span>Row</span></i><span> has a fork in it.</span></p> <p><span>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately,” </span><span>Stockman <a href="https://twitter.com/papaRPG/status/2024941290492694703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2024941290492694703%7Ctwgr%5E5b5766a4b2f5941f6a7dde345eab9a61c98bcdd8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fi-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">told a fan on Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>)</span><span>. “I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it.”</span></p> <p><span>Though Stockman hadn’t been with </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> developer Volition for years, he claimed last November that Embracer Group approached him to help with a course correction for the franchise. The pitch, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-original-saints-rows-design-director-says-hes-been-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-potential-prequel/"><span>as he described it</span></a><span>, was a </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> prequel set in the 1970s. This new setting could have done a more balanced job of giving </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> a desperately needed fresh coat, while affording itself ample opportunities for its signature buffoonery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.</p> <p>Saints Row is once again dead. <a href="https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD">https://t.co/cpPVcRjxwD</a> <a href="https://t.co/FWpjC6kmkT">pic.twitter.com/FWpjC6kmkT</a></p> <p>— rpg! (@papaRPG) <a href="https://twitter.com/papaRPG/status/2024941290492694703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Promising as that was, it did not get very far. Only a few months later, Stockman now believes he is being “ghosted” by Embracer and that it’s probably the end of the road for </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span>’s 20-year joy ride. “I wish things were different,” he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>While it’s since become the norm, Embracer Group were one of the earlier conglomerates who got into the practice of hoovering up game studios and squeezing them dry. They’ve toyed around with portfolios like Gearbox, Crystal Dynamics, THQ and dozens more, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-sells-studios-collapse-nintendo-classics-black-ops-7-update-2000647577"><span>all to mixed results</span></a><span>. Their acquisition of Volition occurred in 2018, part of a package in the purchase of Koch Media. The 2022 reboot would be the only game Volition made under Embracer, developed under routine restructuring and staff transfers between other studios. When this banged-up </span><i><span>Saints Row</span></i><span> failed to meet sales expectations, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-studio-volition-after-30-1850792734"><span>Volition was shuttered</span></a><span> by Embracer in 2023.</span></p>

 <p><span>This end is merely another page in the book of Embracer squashing out potential sequels, having recently binned revivals for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/more-details-about-xboxs-canceled-perfect-dark-reportedly-leak-2000627538"><i><span>Perfect Dark</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890"><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i></a><span> before that. Having picked up Crystal Dynamics in 2022, their first outing with the </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span> series is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crystal-dynamics-tomb-raider-open-world-layoffs-2000644117"><span>already facing turbulence</span></a><span> as Embracer enacts their signature restructuring.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Promises Two Far Cry Games Are Coming As Open-World Shooter Continues Its Longest Hiatus Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574</link>
            <guid>1442764</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-far-cry-game-1680319871"><em>Far Cry 7</em></a> was not supposed to take this long, but Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is promising the wait will be worth it. Asked about the state of the publisher’s biggest franchises and why they’re taking so long to make in a recent interview, the cofounder took the unusual step of confirming the existence of two previously reported upcoming<em> Far Cry</em> projects.</p> <p>“We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios,” he <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told <em>Variety</em></a> this week. “Under the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year. On <em>Far Cry</em>, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development.”</p> <p>The existence of both of these projects was <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-multiplayer-ubisoft-star-wars-snowdrop-1850038103">first reported back in early 2023</a>.&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7</em> was being developed under the codename Project Blackbird while the second game, a multiplayer spin-off, was being developed under the codename <em>Project Maverick</em>. While Ubisoft mentioned both games in internal presentations at the time as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises, they continue to face delays and remain MIA <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">as the company tries to implement quality checks with higher standards</a>.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Far Cry 7</em> taking so long?</h2> <p>Historically, big <em>Far Cry</em> sequels have come out every two to three years, with smaller spin-offs releasing in-between. Since Ubisoft bought the franchise and launched <em>Far Cry 2</em> back in 2008, the longest gap between new entries has been four years. It will have been five years since <em>Far Cry 6</em> released come this fall. A similar breakdown in the pipeline has hit other major Ubisoft franchises as it gets more complex and expensive to develop AAA blockbusters.</p> <p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>, the <em>Far Cry</em> multiplayer spin-off Maverick in particular has faced major challenges. While it started as an extraction shooter, Maverick has continued to evolve and morph during development. While Ubisoft has continued to produce impressive, massive open-world single-player adventures, its forays into multiplayer have gone terribly. From <em>Hyper Scape</em> to <em>XDefiant</em>, and all of the botched and canceled live service projects in-between, Ubisoft has been unable to recreate the success of its biggest multiplayer staple, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>.</p>

 <h2>“Several” <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games are just around the corner</h2> <p>On the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> front, the path forward is looking much clearer. An unannounced remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> appears to still be on track for release in 2026 despite a recent delay. The previously teased multiplayer spin-off Invictus is also still “locked-in,” according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">to <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, with the next single-player game, <em>Hexe</em>, reportedly slated for 2027. Multiple unannounced mobile spin-offs were recently canceled, however, and a mobile game from <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568694651800133632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568694651800133632%7Ctwgr%5Eb9b4ae047170f42a47dc2044f55096d535b137cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fassassins-creed-red-mirage-ubisoft-hexe-jade-netflix-1849521945">Netflix called <em>Jade</em></a> seems unlikely to ever see the light of day as the streamer pivots to licensed party games.</p>

 <p>Whatever happens to Ubisoft as it partitions its sprawling empire of studios into easily sellable “Creative Houses,” <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> will remain cornerstones of whatever’s left. There’s already a <em>Far Cry</em> TV series in development at FX and a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> historical drama coming to Netflix. All Ubisoft has to do is actually release a new<em> Far Cry</em> game at some point while bringing some excitement and shine back to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p>

            <p>Patrick Söderlund – founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> studio, Embark – has been appointed as executive chairman at Nexon to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth" for its parent company.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of Arc Raiders, Söderlund will now be working "closely with [Nexon] CEO Junghun Lee and the executive leadership team", setting the "strategic direction" that Lee will then implement.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this position comes in addition to Söderlund's already pretty meaty role leading Embark – which is owned by Nexon – or is in place of it, but it appears to be the former.</p>

<p>"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth – incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said via a press statement.</p>
<p>"This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. [Nexon CEO] Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen, and I'm ready to get to work."</p>
<p>It's a huge appointment for Nexon, which – although bobbing along just fine with its immensely popular mobile titles like MapleStory – has failed to get a bite of the live-service sector, and chiefly dabbled in casual and mobile gaming until subsidiary Mintrocket released the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also published Embark Studios' inaugural title, The Finals, that same year, and the middling The First Descendant in 2024.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Arc Raiders continues to impress, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>.</p>
<p>It has also started to grapple with the consequences of that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> that allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, confirming it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">finished a large investigation into how the recent exploits and glitches</a> came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hackers Raise The Alarm About Discord’s Recent Age-Verification Partner]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570</link>
            <guid>1442752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, Discord </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>users reported seeing prompts to submit personal information to Persona</span></a><span>, a third-party age-verification service. As Discord commits to universal age-verification, the new measures have come under </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><span>intense scrutiny</span></a><span> after </span><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service"><span>previous security failures</span></a><span>. Now a trio of hacktivists say they’ve successfully breached Persona, getting a closer look at how the company uses submitted biometrics. They say their findings raise alarms beyond the possibility of leaks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.therage.co/persona-age-verification/"><span>According to </span><i><span>The Rage</span></i></a><span>, Persona’s front-end security left a lot to be desired. Worse, however, were investigative findings that suggested Persona’s surveillance of the users whose data it collected was way more sprawling than originally believed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was initially meant to be a passive recon investigation,” </span><a href="https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona"><span>writes vmfunc, a cybersecurity researcher and one of the hackers</span></a><span>, “that quickly turned into a rabbit hole deep dive into how commercial AI and federal government operations work together to violate our privacy every waking second.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm sharing all email correspondences between <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a> and myself in advance of <a href="https://twitter.com/vmfunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vmfunc</a>'s later blog posts because without context, a signed statement from myself has only created more conspiracy theories regarding Persona. <a href="https://t.co/nDJorLEP4H">pic.twitter.com/nDJorLEP4H</a></p> <p>— Rick Song (@rickcsong) <a href="https://twitter.com/rickcsong/status/2024423711559102578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>On top of finding it surprisingly easy to access data gathered by Persona, the research showed that faces and biometrics were not just being scanned for age verification, but flagged for suspicious behavior and bounced off watchlists as well. To some, particularly those who don’t worry about their face being deemed “suspicious,” this may not sound like an Orwellian level of intrusion, until you remember Persona’s full network.</span></p>

 <p><span>Persona </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>received $150 million in 2021</span></a><span> from the Founders Fund, a long-running tech investor group headed by Peter Thiel. Thiel’s main business, on top of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>palling around in Jeffery Epstein’s emails</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000"><span>waiting for the antichrist</span></a><span>, is Palantir, an intentionally ominously-named data brokering service that is currently </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><span>peddling user information to support ICE raids</span></a><span>. The findings of vmfunc and co’s research doesn’t directly tether Persona and Discord’s operations to Palantir or Thiel, but it wouldn’t be conspiratorial to point out that all this data seems to be funnelling along similar slopes.</span></p>

 <h2>Trust but verify</h2> <p><span>Persona has confirmed the breach, CEO Rick Song corresponding and </span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"><span>even thanking the</span></a><span><a href="https://x.com/rickcsong/status/2025038040599810385"> hackers</a> for flagging the security exploit. This has not, however, </span><a href="https://x.com/vmfunc/status/2024433404683374921"><span>tempered concerns</span></a><span> among those hacktivists about how the user information is ultimately being used.</span></p> <p><span>“Transparently, we are actively working on a couple of potential contracts which would be publicly visible if we move forward,” writes Christie Kim, chief operating officer at Persona, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-and-persona-end-partnership-after-shady-uk-age-test-sparks-outcry/"><span>in an email regarding the security breach and speculation around Discord</span></a><span>. “However, these engagements are strictly for workforce account security of government employees and do not include ICE or any agency within the Department of Homeland Security.”</span></p>

 <p><span>After the alarm was initially raised about Persona, Discord claimed its work with the Thiel-backed firm was only temporary, and that it didn’t have new contacts with it moving forward. It also promised user info was being wiped from servers within seven days of being gathered.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement provided to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, Discord said the “limited test” had concluded, though what Persona does with the information in that period isn’t clarified. It seems to go much further than verifying which PlayStation you grew up with. Even after the dust settles, it’s unclear if the trust can ever be repaired as an exodus of Discord users have already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-alternative-teamspeak-age-verification-check-rivals-2000669693"><span>flooded alternatives like TeamSpeak</span></a><span>.</span></p>
