		<p>Beastieball was practically made for me, and I can’t thank the creators enough. It comes from Wishes Unltd., who previously released the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/05/chicory-a-colorful-tale-review/">Chicory</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/27/wandersong-review/">Wandersong</a>, both of which are joys to play, so I’m not shocked to find that Beastieball maintains those good vibes. This time around, it’s all about a world of creature catching, and also… volleyball.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beastieball - Early Access Launch Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oU76fsW2IcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basically, you have to try and save land near where you grew up from being overrun and turned into a Beastieball stadium, and to do that, you have to become a Beastieball coach and go on the ultimate tournament arc, constantly pushing yourself and your Beastie’s to new heights, and probably learning some stuff along the way. It’s a very cute idea, and it all gets fought out via volleyball.</p>


<p>Battles are turn-based, and you can do different things depending on if you’re attacking or defending. Each Beastie gets its own special attacks and support abilities, and each one also has its own stats. Different attacks can hit in different directions too, and if you attack a lane or a row where there isn’t an opposing Beastie, then you can win the game outright. You can also throw your attacks at the Beasties to drain their stamina, and when they hit zero stamina they need a nap before they can play again.</p>


<p>None of the Beasties get hurt, which is nice, and the ones you find in the wild will willingly play with you because they actually want to – like when a cat runs at you from across the street meowing to say hello and get some fussing. Plus, if you can show off your skills, they’ll join you as long as you’ve got a spare jersey. It’s just so darn cute, and it’s such a nice change of pace from pitting cute creatures against each other in deathmatches to get badges… or any other very non-specific examples you can think of from the genre.</p>
<p>The character designs are all wonderful, you get to recharge your social battery for cool events as you defeat stronger foes, and you can customise your character as you want. Beastieball is still in Early Access, but it already feels like one of the coolest games I’ve played in ages. It’s just so wonderfully fulfilling, and it makes for a great change to a lot of other games in the genre. Also, we need more volleyball games so I can live out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS-N8KfZ5EU">Haikyuu</a> dreams because I’m almost definitely too old to join a volleyball team.</p>

<p>Beastieball is out now via Steam Early Access. Please play this game and don’t miss out on it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/payday-3s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3%E2%80%99s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet.1038450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/payday-3s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Typically, when a game experiences a rough launch or a development team decides to downsize, it isn't good news. While Starbreeze has downsized the Payday 3 team, it doesn't seem that there are planned layoffs, which, in the current climate of the game industry, is great news. When it comes to games that were highly anticipated and then flopping, Payday 3 is pretty high on the list. Even Starbreeze is aware of the fact that the game launched unsuccessfully. As a result, they've now downsized the team, as reported in <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbreeze's interim report</a>.</p>
<p>In the report, CEO Mats Juhl states "in the coming months, investment will be lower as we round off 'Operation Medic Bag' for Payday and therefore enter Year 2 with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content." The report did not specify how downsizing the team will affect Payday exactly and whether it will affect the frequency of updates in Payday 3. This means that <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/">the updates</a> will be smaller or less frequent. Despite the fact that the team has downsized and that Payday 3 didn't perform quite to their expectations, the report says that Starbreeze "remains financially strong," which is a good sign for a company in today's climate.</p>
<p>In the report, there was no mention of any layoffs, which is a pretty good sign. Hopefully this means that the staff have been relocated elsewhere within the company, or that they have already landed on their feet. While Payday 3 wasn't quite so successful, Juhl does mention that the recent DLCs that have been released for Payday 3 were well received, providing a glimmer of hope for Starbreeze. Although Payday 3's sales weren't up to scratch, the company's overall revenue has been cushioned nicely by the "relatively stable sales of Payday 2," a game that players found themselves returning to instead of playing Payday 3.</p>
<p>While the report predominantly focuses on the financial updates of the company, and how their current games are performing, there is also mention of Project Baxter, a dungeons &amp; Dragons project that "continues at full speed," with the report going on to state that there are internal playtests taking place, with a lot of "active discussions" happening with a lot of industry-leading companies.</p>
<p>While Starbreeze is known for making the iconic Payday franchise,&nbsp; they have also made games such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. They've also started to dip their toes into publishing, with Dead by Daylight being one of the most well-known titles that they've published.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-admits-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-underperformed.1038447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, an action-tower defense hybrid that also represents a foray into new IP for the studio, underperformed compared to its expectations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameBiz report</a>),&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>received strong reviews from both critics and players, but failed to translate those reviews into unit sales.</p>

<p>Capcom blames this deficiency on "insufficient marketing and the failure to generate buzz prior to release", as Automaton says. In essence, not enough was done to let people know what exactly&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>was before release, and that's never going to help unit sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=209PJ2rg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=zgTImkld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Capcom hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio certainly isn't wrong when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>' critical performance. The game has an 82 critic average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16948/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, with 90% of critics recommending it, and it enjoys scores in the 80-85 range across <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all</a> three current-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> as well.</p>

<p>Users also seem to have broadly positive opinions about the game. It currently has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">91% Very Positive rating on Steam</a> across 1,149 reviews (at time of writing), so it's clear that those who are playing&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often the case that critically-acclaimed games that exist within a particular niche can't drum up sales.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>might be a tough sell for a lot of players; it's an action-tower defense hybrid, and it's not easy to see exactly what kind of game it is from screenshots, either.</p>

<p>Still, in the GameBiz report (for which we're using machine translation), Capcom says it intends to continue promoting&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>in order to achieve its initial sales target, although it wasn't clear about what that target actually is.</p>




<p>Although sales of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>were apparently lackluster, Capcom says games like&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>have been selling as expected.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company is currently gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>in February</a>, and if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">beta performance</a> is anything to go by, that game is likely to provide a massive boost to Capcom's finances when it's released.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>is all about, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/9PCWXX0MS15S/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

<p>FromSoftware is set to bring back its best-selling Dark Souls game for a new audience. According to a new claim, Dark Souls 3 is getting the remaster treatment from the studio.</p>



<p>The report comes from known leaker “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shpeshalnick.xboxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>” Nick Baker, who made the reveal during the latest episode of his Xbox Era podcast.</p>



<p>“A lot of people will probably file this under ‘this was obvious’,” he said. “What I have heard is that we are getting a Dark Souls 3 remaster.”</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Baker hinted that he had more information on the remaster, but wasn’t “allowed to pass that on”.</p>



<p>First released in 2016, Dark Souls 3 is the best-selling Dark Souls game with over 10 million copies sold. As a franchise, Dark Souls has sold over 35 million units since its debut in September 2011. It also helped fully establish the Souls-like genre that a number of games have utilized in recent years  like the Nioh series, Lords of the Fallen, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-blocks-under-13s-from-dming-others-outside-games-amid-scrutiny-over-child-protection<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has announced significant changes designed to protect children who play on the platform amid increased scrutiny and concern from parents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the changes due in the coming months, users under the age of 13 will no longer be able to directly message others on Roblox outside of games or experiences (also known as platform chat).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox will also introduce a built-in setting that limits users under the age of 13 to public broadcast messages only within a game or experience. By default, users younger than 13 will not be able to directly message others. Parents can change this setting in Parental Controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, users under the age of nine will only be able to access games or experiences with content labeled Minimal or Mild, with parental consent required to access Moderate content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox's changes come on the heels both of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>damning Bloomberg report this summer</u></a> about the prevalence of child predators on the platform and, more recently, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-accused-of-massively-inflating-user-stats-and-fostering-hellscape-for-children-in-scathing-report"><u>report from investment firm Hindenburg Research</u></a> that accused the company of, among other things, being a haven for groomers and pedophiles due to a lack of up-front screening of new accounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It claimed to have found open trading of child pornography on the site as well as violent and hateful speech and sexually explicit content in numerous games marketed to kids on the platform. Roblox responded, saying that "safety and civility" have been "foundational" to Roblox since its inception. However, Hindenburg followed up by pointing out that it had not addressed allegations of Roblox being a "pedophile hellscape."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there’s always more to be done,” Matt Kaufman, Chief Safety Officer at Roblox, said in a note to the press issued today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today’s launch represents the next stage in that evolution. It is the culmination of many months of product development and consultation with online safety experts, and follows the rollout of more than 30 new safety feature enhancements this year alone, as we continue on our mission to build a safe and civil space for play, learning and creativity for millions around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also from today, accounts with parent privileges will be able to view their child’s screen time over the past week, set daily screen time limits, and view their child’s friends list. In addition, accounts with parent privileges will be able to access existing Roblox tools that allow parents to set spend restrictions, limit or enable certain chat functionality, and determine the type of content their child has access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming months, Roblox will also introduce new restrictions to prevent users under the age of 13 from searching, discovering or playing experiences that have yet to be assigned a Content Label. Restricted content will remain blocked until a user is at least 17 years old and has verified their age by uploading a selfie and a photo of a valid government-issued ID.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Roblox announced that it will age-gate certain experiences for users under the age of 13, based on the type of user behaviors sometimes found in those experiences. These new restrictions apply to experiences that are primarily designed for socializing with users outside of their friends list and experiences that allow free-form writing or drawing, such as on a chalkboard or a whiteboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox faced criticism</u></a> after a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted by several other characters. Around the same time, a six-year-old girl was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly invited into a "sex room" in the game</u></a>.

There are no blocks to slice or balls to smash, and you don’t need to flail your arms like an octopus in a mosh pit. While other games ask you to zone out and follow along to a pre-set beat, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you wield the most majestic of brass instruments—the trombone, and lets you take control of the music itself. You’re not just reacting to a song like a musical lemming—you’re performing it. Every note, slide, and toot is yours to control, letting you decide whether to stick with the melody or go rogue in Improv Mode with a jazz solo wild enough to have your music teacher reaching for the tissues.</p><p><strong>Campaign Promises</strong></p><p>Our all-new Campaign Mode offers an epic journey packed with surprises for beginners and <em><a title="Games > Trombone Champ [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a></em> veterans alike. It eases you in, letting you get comfortable with the instrument’s quirks and rhythm. But don’t get too cozy. The campaign ramps up faster than a trombone glissando, introducing complex tracks and challenges that push your rhythm, timing, and ability to adapt. Every milestone you reach unlocks new tracks, and you’ll leave your mark on the leaderboards as you compete for the illustrious title of the one true <em>Trombone Champ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hornucopia</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest. One trombone just isn’t enough. How many is too many? We’re not sure yet, but we’re definitely going to find out. At launch, you’ll have over 20 trombones to unlock, each with its own sound, style, and… personality. From a purrfect cat trombone that meows as you play to a ridiculously floppy pool noodle that bends with every slide or even a melting ice cream cone, each trombone has a unique look, sound, and feel. And with dozens more unlockable trombones rolling out in the coming weeks and months, there will always be a new piece of brass to chase after.</p><p>As if that weren’t enough for you relentless collectors, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> also offers a full set of collectible Tromboner Cards. Yes, they’re called Tromboner Cards, and yes, they’re exactly as ridiculous as they sound. With 50 individual cards packed with absurd trombone trivia and mysterious lore, these cards are truly another thing to unlock and collect. Think you’ve got what it takes to snag them all? Just don’t lose your grip on the slide (or your grip on reality) along the way.</p><p><strong>Make It Make Sense</strong></p><p>Thanks to the advanced haptics and adaptive triggers of the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you feel each note as you play. Whether you’re executing a delicate note or unleashing a full blast, the tactile feedback makes each musical moment feel impactful. Plus, with the game running at a smooth 120 hertz on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and delivering crisp, vibrant visuals in 4K HDR, every toot and slide looks as impressive as it feels. The dynamic environments and audience reactions adjust to your playing, adding an extra layer of immersion to every performance as you bring the music to life.</p><p><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></p><p>As our debut PlayStation VR2 adaptation, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em>, kicks off Flat2VR Studios’ mission to take the classics and give them new life in VR. This is just the beginning for us—we have more in the pipeline, each reimagined to fully leverage the immersive power of VR. We’re thrilled to have PlayStation players join us on this journey as we work to push PlayStation VR2 gaming to new heights.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened! - Announce | PS VR2 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwmnT8t_3Gw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>

<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-2-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>player numbers on Steam have shot up following an anniversary update released last week, resulting in the game reaching its highest concurrent Steam player count since its release.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB charts</a>&nbsp;shows that the game managed to reach 64,085 players around 21 hours ago (at time of writing), which is its highest total of all time on the platform.</p>

<p>At time of writing, 45,121 players were still enjoying Gordon Freeman's second major adventure, so&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is still riding that wave of renewed popularity. Who knows for how much longer it will last? Let's hope a while, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=jbFy806S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=MNMuVhwb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is enjoying a surge of popularity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s surge in popularity comes after the appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">20th Anniversary Update</a>, which was released on Friday to coincide with - you guessed it - the game's 20th anniversary.</p>

<p>The update adds both Episode One and Episode Two to the base&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>game, so if you somehow own&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>but not its expansions, then you can now enjoy those at no additional cost. They're well worth it!</p>

<p>You'll also now find developer commentaries for the original game included in the Steam package, as well as Steam Workshop support to make modding a little easier. Several visual bugs have been fixed, and new graphics options have been added to "push the visual fidelity of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>".</p>

<p>If you want to know how&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>was made, then you'll also probably find the new documentary, created by the folks behind a similar project for the original&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-update-by-valve-available-now-with-steam-deck-support" rel="nofollow">25th anniversary</a>, entertaining and interesting.</p>

The game is currently being given away <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on Steam</a>, with the giveaway running until 10am Pacific today (that's 1pm Eastern). Grab it if you haven't already.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>update arrives not long after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">discovery of something codenamed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">White Sands</a>&nbsp;</em>once again set off speculation around a new <i>Half-Life&nbsp;</i>game earlier this year.

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Adds New Parental Controls to Protect Children]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adds-new-parental-controls-to-protect-children.1038393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Roblox has added new parental controls to its platform to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox announced the new parental control and safety measures on Monday. The measures aim to give parents and caregivers more control to protect children. Roblox says that some of these changes will be made immediately, starting today, whereas other features will be rolled out next year.</p>



<p>These new features will enable parents to see exactly how long their children are spending on Roblox and view their friends list. They will also enable parents to set a daily limit on the amount of screen time children can have on the platform.</p>



<p>The company also revealed that children under the age of 13 would no longer be able to send direct messages to other users by default unless a parent or guardian changes the setting. Roblox will also launch a slew of new content labels that will make it easier for children and parents to decide what content is age-appropriate. These four new categories will be “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and, “restricted,” which will be the strongest category and could contain “strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor.”</p>



<p>Users under the age of 9 years old can only access “minimal” or “mild” content and will need parental consent for “moderate” content. </p>



<p>You can read the full changes on the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website here</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox has come under a lot of scrutiny in the past couple of years because it lacks online safety for young children. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turkey banned the platform because of concerns about child exploitation</a>. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report in October</a> also revealed that it found the trading of child pornography in some of its games.</p>



<p>What do you think of Roblox’s new safety changes? Let us know in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in several interviews last week. In the second half of the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> with Game File's Stephen Totilo, published over the weekend, the executive said that he'd rather revisit some of Microsoft's many owned intellectual properties than rely on licensed games any further.</p>
<p><em>I'm not the biggest fan [of making licensed games]. It creates some complexities for us when we think about putting it in a subscription or streaming it. We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted because you lose certain licenses. So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, that the team has a goal around what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft does have two big triple-A licensed games in development at Bethesda's MachineGames and Arkane Lyon: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-official-concept-art-shared-by-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Blade</a>, respectively, both of which are IPs owned by Disney. On that partnership, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team. I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the intellectual property that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.</em></p>
<p>It's not hard to understand why Phil Spencer would feel that way: Disney isn't known for licensing its prized IPs cheaply. Moreover, Microsoft really does have access to a boatload of unused intellectual properties, from Rare's beloved Conker and Banjo-Kazooie to Killer Instinct and all the IPs from the latest acquisitions (Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>Spencer is also known for wearing t-shirts of some of these classic franchises, like Hexen or, more recently, Starcraft, during the Xbox TGS 2024 live broadcast. This gets fans excited about the prospect of reviving those IPs, and today's comments will undoubtedly fuel more chitchat in the respective communities.</p>

"We wanted to take this occasion to clarify that all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to clarify "there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle passes featured in the Animus Hub" and "players will have access to regular content and missions at no extra cost." More details will be revealed closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">was recently delayed from November to February 14</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is also ditching its main paid content model of releasing a Season Pass with two main, paid expansion drops in the year after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">The faux "early access" period</a> that sees publishers charge players more to play on the actual release date instead of three days later has also been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing myriad pieces of downloadable content for free will perhaps bring some Assassin's Creed fans back on-side in what's otherwise been a particularly rough pre-launch campaign for Ubisoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also begin a new modern day story, perhaps linked to the Animus Hub, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-begin-a-new-modern-day-story-after-the-series-post-desmond-blues">Ubisoft admitted it's "struggled to find its footing" with that aspects of Assassin's Creed</a> in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2902600/Call_of_Elyndra/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, with the possibility of later console ports. A demo will be available on December 2. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-928318"></span></p><p>Get the first details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Call of Elyndra</em> is the debut game of Quorum Games. The game combines the best things from the <a title="Platforms > SNES" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/snes">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>-era <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> (think <em>Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> or <em>Ys</em> games) with cozy farm games (like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or <em>Harvest Moon</em>). The players will be free to choose how they want to play the game—whether they want to do both farming and questing or just one or the other.</p><p>The game tells a story about three adventurers (you play as one of them) who, led by an odd dream, wandered to Elyndra—a village in the middle of nowhere. After helping the locals with retrieving a child kidnapped by monsters, the three are granted a plot of land to farm. However, a military conflict between independent villages and an evil Empire is brewing. You’re thrust right into it. What will you do?</p><p>All of the assets in the game are hand-made in a detailed pixel-art style, reminiscent of Game Boy Advance games. You’ll traverse through varied landscapes, from forests through mountaintops to beaches. These places will be filled with various NPCs, locations to explore, and quests to take. Aside from unveiling the story, you’ll gather various tools that will help you with combat and traversal. What if you want to stay in Elyndra and farm? Various intricacies of farming and crafting systems, along with building relationships with various villagers, will also present a great way of progressing through the game. Of course, simultaneous farming and questing are also possible.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928325"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As the game combines the best of two worlds, it’s able to address certain possibly undesirable characteristics of both old school action RPGs and cozy games. Some of its features include:</p><ul><li>An expansive storyline that is expected to last for about 30-plus hours of gameplay.</li><li>Character development- some of which will be quite substantial.</li><li>Plenty of various fun side activities like fishing to keep the gameplay varied.</li><li>A world with a deep lore inspired by various real-world ancient religions and cultures.</li><li>Roughly 30 hours of core gameplay.</li><li>A real-time combat system with dodge rolls, items, and special powers to aid you in your <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.</li></ul><p>The engine used to make the game used to be <em>RPG Maker</em>, however approximately 70 percent of the code is custom-made.</p><p>You will be able to give the full version of the game a go in the near future, as the release date remains to be announced. A demo will release on December 2, which will feature roughly 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay, showing the very beginning of the game, including farming, the first dungeon, and the reveal of the primary antagonist of the game.</p><p>The game is expected to be released on Steam for Windows, with the possibility of later console ports.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gust [798 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a> have released a new trailer, information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a></em> introducing new combat and synthesis details. Plus, over 30 minutes of gameplay was showcased during this weekend’s second official broadcast for the game. <span id="more-928098"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,870 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. Mysterious characters obsessed with alchemy such as a Noble in a Black Cloak (voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki), a Monocular Werewolf (voiced by Takehito Koyasu), a Sheep-Eye Witch (voiced by Yoko Hikasa), and a Dragon-Winged Warrior (voiced by Takaya Kuroda) stand in Yumia’s way.</p><p>To prepare for the adventure ahead, players will rediscover the <em>Atelier</em> franchise’s signature synthesizing system in a fresh form by manipulating “mana” to create new items useful in combat or exploration. To create more powerful items, fans will have to master the art of “Resonance Synthesis” by adding ingredients which resonate with each other to the “Alchemy Core” of the recipe. The strength of the resonance will depend on the quality of the ingredients selected.</p><p>The combat system has also been revamped in <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> to offer intense real-time combat with intuitive gameplay. The skills available to active team members will depend on their distance from the enemy (close or ranged combat). Compared to previous instalments, players can now move or interchange characters at any time during the fight. When certain conditions are met, a powerful “Friend Action” combo can be unleashed in battle. By meeting certain conditions, players will be able to activate “Mana Surge,” which will allow for exclusive actions to be performed. In addition, each character will have a unique special move, “Maximize Mana Surge,” which can inflict significant damage on enemies.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928270"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Journeying alongside Yumia and her friends, players will explore the vast open world of the Aladiss continent. As they travel, they will be able to build their own bases. Thanks to the new “Building” feature, fans will freely be able to create and decorate their atelier from a vast choice of walls, floors, roofs, furniture, and more, or choose to select a predefined base model from the catalog. By increasing the “comfort level” of their atelier, players will unlock bonuses such as the ability to develop their base and enhance the skills of Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Lastly, if players do not wish to return to their base during exploration, they will be able to set up a camp where they can spend time cooking, which will provide various benefits during exploration and combat, or resting. Certain character events that can only be seen at camps will sometimes occur, providing greater insight into Yumia and her companions.</p><p>Everyone who purchases either a physical or digital edition up to two weeks after release will receive the “Athlete of Memories” early purchase costume for Yumia, the “Floating Object of Memories” costume for Flammi, and the unique “Training Wrist Weight” equipment.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,626 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21, 2025 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has previously expressed his wariness towards licensed games, but he recently praised Disney and Lucasfilm for being strong partners on their upcoming projects together.</p><p>"I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>. "They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team."</p><p>During the same interview, Spencer explained that one of the reasons he dislikes dealing with licensed titles is that the licenses can expire, which leads to games being delisted over time. Instead, he prefers to focus on IP owned by Microsoft's umbrella of developers and studios. But for games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Spencer is willing to make some exceptions in part because the developer--MachineGames--has such an intense passion for the property.</p><p>"I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world," related Spencer. "The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game--the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the [intellectual property] that we have that we own, I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, while PlayStation 5 fans will have to wait until Spring 2025. In the meantime, Microsoft and IHOP are launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">an Indiana Jones-themed menu</a> starting today, November 18. Members of IHOP's International Bank of Pancakes will also be able to use their receipts to earn "PanCoins" that can be redeemed for Xbox prizes or even a new line of limited-edition cups featuring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Halo Infinite, and Sea of Thieves designed by Xbox artist Matt Taylor.</p>

                <p>Devoted fans of Pokemon should be well aware that 25 years ago this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-gold-silver-review/1900-2536200/" data-ref-id="1900-2536200">Pokemon Gold and Silver</a> debuted in Japan before coming to the U.S. nearly a year later. The game added over 100 new Pokemon to the lore and it's widely regarded as one of the best titles in the franchise. Now, The Pokemon Company is honoring the 25th anniversary of Pokemon Gold and Silver with some new merchandise that may make you want to "catch 'em all."</p><p>The announcement was shared on <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/goods/2024/11/241115_to01.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Pokemon</a>, and for now at least, the merch appears to be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooixSl118ptVAz_Muj67LRmyAGy-hkGhr3M20XUPPFL4uHcvzjX" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese Pokemon Center</a>. The most eye-catching examples of the new products are the plushes for the games' mascots, Ho-Oh and Lugia, as well as some really cool jackets that come with reversible designs that feature the Johto region--which was introduced in Pokemon Gold and Silver. There are also picture-changing cups, plates, backpacks, bookends, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912"></a><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia plushies from the upcoming Pokemon Gold and Silver merch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400913,1300-4400914,1300-4400915,1300-4400916,1300-4400917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"></figure><p>The bad news is that there don't seem to be any plans for Nintendo or The Pokemon Company to bring this merchandise to America despite the intense fanbase that is still going strong in this country. It's almost certain that scalpers will pick up these items and resell them on American auction sites for exorbitant amounts of money. But until Pokemon's parent companies decide to rectify that situation, there aren't many options for fans outside of Japan.</p><p>Pokemon was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gets-denied-entry-to-toy-hall-of-fame/1100-6527729/" data-ref-id="1100-6527729">denied a place in America's Toy Hall of Fame</a>. However, we strongly suspect Pokemon will eventually find its way in.

			<p>A Portal 2 RTX Remix mod is now available for download, introducing path tracing to the amazing puzzle game released by Valve over ten years ago.</p>
<p>Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility mod, developed by xoxor4d, greatly enhances the game's visuals with path tracing and works surprisingly well despite RTX Remix not being intended to support the game. There are some issues here and there, as the game's effects are rendered using shaders, and performance isn't the best, which isn't surprising considering how demanding path tracing is even in older games, but this mod is a perfectly viable way to experience one of the best games ever released by Valve.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out this Portal 2 RTX Remix mod before downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>, you can check it out in action in the video below shared by gabdeg on YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal 2 with RTX Remix Compatibility Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yORRCNjgVxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series developed by Valve. Released in 2011, the game takes everything that made the original amazing and ups it to eleven, introducing a new set of puzzles as well as a two-player cooperative mode featuring a story, test chambers, and characters completely different from the single-player campaign. You can learn more about the game by heading over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam store page.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> has given players plenty of content to dig their teeth into. Not only are there two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-saug-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and a variety of cosmetic rewards to unlock in the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for the game, but there’s more planned to release throughout Black Ops 6 Season 1’s duration.</p>



<p>The Hit List event will arrive in BO6 Season 1, and if you’re interested in the details, such as its release date, rewards, and more, here’s everything we know so far.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Hit List event will arrive on <strong>November 21, 2024, at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>. </p>



<p>The event tab is now in the game with a countdown to its release, so this is how we know exactly when the limited-time event will be arriving.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</h2>



<p>Hit List is a <strong>limited-time event</strong> coming to Black Ops 6 during Season 1 and it <strong>offers players a chance to earn rewards via in-game challenges</strong>. </p>



<p>We don’t yet know what these challenges are, but the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> revealed that the event will give players a “board of contracts” that they will need to take out. Taking out these hit list contracts in-game will grant players exclusive rewards. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty are yet to reveal the official rewards, but based on the promotional image for the Black Ops 6 Hit List event, we can assume that players will be working towards earning the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadow Perk (Strategist)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a> Secondary</li>



<li>Power Drill Melee Weapon</li>



<li>CoD Points</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems players will be able to get the new weapons through this event, as well as the new Shadow Perk, which makes you undetectable by enemy traps and mines.</p>



<p>We expect more on top of this, but these are some of the rewards seen in the promotional image for the Hit List event. Previous Call of Duty events have also had cosmetic rewards like Calling Cards, Emblems, and more, so perhaps those will be up for grabs too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has sparked backlash after confirming plans to make a “significantly lower level of investment” in the game’s second year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze’s struggle with Payday 3 after last year’s disastrous launch is well-documented, but its recent series of year one anniversary updates were well-received by players who had hoped for similarly significant updates during the co-op shooter's second year. Indeed, Payday 3’s recent Steam user reviews are on ‘mostly positive’, with all reviews on ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that goodwill may now be under threat after comments from Starbreeze acting CEO Mats Juhl in a <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a> caused some Payday 3 players to express concern that the studio was now prioritizing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash revolves around Juhl’s comment on Payday 3’s level of investment for year two versus year one. It is below, reproduced in its entirety.</p><blockquote>During the quarter, both the third and fourth DLCs for Payday 3 – “Chapter 3: Houston Breakout” and “Chapter 4: Fear &amp; Greed” were released. In conjunction with both launches, a lot of free content was also released to all players, including a new free heist. Both DLCs received a very positive reception from the player base and the game's rating on Steam, among others, has taken significant steps upwards. The game's MAU (monthly active players) is holding steady considering that we in September left Xbox GamePass. The level of investment during Payday 3's first year on the market, both through launched DLCs and "Operation Medic Bag", has been at an elevated level. Ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line (“significantly lower level of investment”) is the one causing all the damage here, and players are blaming it on Starbreeze shifting focus onto Project Baxter, its in-development Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Elsewhere in the financial report, Juhl said production on Project Baxter had ramped up (along with the payment of licensing fees to Wizards of the Coast), and that as Payday 3’s game-saving Operation Medic Bag updates ramp down, the game will enter year two “with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgruntled players have taken to Steam reviews to let their feelings about this be known. “Dead game,” reads one negative review, “like this time for real.” “Dropping this game as soon as it started to show promise is insane,” said another. “Significantly lower,” another review reads. "I've tried defending this game for so long, but it is really frustrating seeing the company executives kill this game before it has a chance to fully recover just to fund their next project that will more than likely flop, just like Payday 3," another reviewer said. "Save your money and the headache; Payday 3's future is genuinely grim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar outcry over on the Payday subreddit, where fans are already hitting out at Starbreeze and Project Baxter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Starbreeze sounds like it still believes in Payday 3, even if some of its players do not. “Starbreeze remains financially strong, with a healthy balance sheet almost free of debt and a cash position to execute our strategy,” Juhl said. “Sales of Payday 3 still have great potential to improve, which is offset somewhat by continued relatively stable sales of Payday 2 and third-party publishing of, among other things, Roboquest. During the same period last year, we booked the revenue attributable to Payday 3's launch, which makes the revenue in the comparison period uniquely high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Payday 2, significantly more people are playing that game on Steam (27,553 24 hour peak) than Payday 3 (1,314 24 hour peak), despite the former being over a decade old. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-director-steps-down-after-disastrous-first-year">Payday 3 director Miodrag Kovačević stepped down to work as a designer instead</a>. Lead producer Andreas Penninger and global brand director Almir Listo were put in place to act as the "creative force" behind the game "in the interim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze is still hiring for Project Baxter, meanwhile, as work on the game “continues at full speed.” “Internally, we have weekly playtests of Baxter, and active discussions with a number of industry-leading players regarding potential collaborations around Baxter's development and launch,” Juhl said. Starbreeze said it has 191 total employees, most of which are based at its head office in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
