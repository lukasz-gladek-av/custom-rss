<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157576/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom effectively created a new genre with its famed <strong>Monster Hunter</strong> series back in the sixth generation of game consoles, and though many challengers over the years (such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/god_eater_3">God Eater</a>) have since tried to get a piece of its pie, nobody has quite managed to recreate its distinct magic. Koei Tecmo's Omega Force (of <strong>Dynasty Warriors</strong> fame) then decided to try its hand in 2023 with the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wild_hearts">Wild Hearts</a>, but the game never really got too far off the ground despite positive reception from both fans and critics.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has come out, KT has decided to try giving its latest monster hunting foray another shot at success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, a modest revisit that’s taking advantage of the distinct Monster Hunter-shaped hole in the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">launch window library</a>. Though it isn’t the roaring revival that some may have hoped it to be, Wild Hearts S still proves to be an enjoyable and engaging monster-hunting action game and one that I’d suggest newcomers look into.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157578/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative in Wild Hearts places you in the role of a travelling hunter who comes to the land of Azuma in search of work and meaning after experiencing diminished demand for your services back home. Your services, of course, are hunting and killing Kemono, which are gigantic nature-themed monsters that threaten villages and their surrounding environment.</p>
<p>After getting absolutely <em>rolled</em> by a Deathstalker (basically a huge ice-themed wolf), your hunter meets a mysterious figure who grants him the power of Karakuri, which enables him to utilise spiritual energy threads in the land to create powerful constructs. Armed with this ability, you then head for the nearby town of Minato to help them out with their ongoing Kemono problem. It’s not all that gripping of a story, but there’s just enough here to keep you invested in the town and focused on protecting it from the endemic threats to its ecosystem.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157565/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Wild Hearts adheres pretty closely to the systems that Monster Hunter popularised, focusing much of the experience on the simple, grindy loop of battling the gigantic Kemono monsters. Across four seasonally themed biomes, there are over 20 full-size Kemono species to take on here, and each brings with it a wealth of elemental attacks and tricks to keep you on your toes as you learn its moveset.</p>
<p>An initial battle against a Kemono can be a little rough as you get repeatedly blasted and beaten by its powerful blows, but experience and careful study soon teach you when to press the attack and when to run for cover or dodge. After killing one, it drops an assortment of unique items which you can then use to upgrade existing weapons and armour sets or build new ones that make it easier to take down even harder monsters.</p>
<p>Capcom got the progression system right with Monster Hunter and Omega Force was wise not to try reinventing the wheel with Wild Hearts—it's just as compelling here as it was there. Not only is there a clear sense of empowerment that comes from gaining actual stat buffs from getting better equipment, but you also just get <em>better</em> with practice as you learn each Kemono’s tells and become more efficient in dodging its attacks and exploiting its weaknesses. Plus, given the largely random nature of the rewards from felling yet another massive beast, there’s a strong ‘just one more’ element as you come up a bit short on materials needed for that next equipment upgrade you’ve been eyeing.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157561/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so similar, but the main gimmick that sets Wild Hearts apart is the flexible Karakuri system, which adds some dynamic tools to your hunter’s arsenal. With this, you can summon various constructs, such as boxes or springs, into the field to give you an edge and support you in some way or throw off the Kemono’s assault. If you recognise a Kemono is about to charge, you can quickly build a wall of crates that’ll both block the charge and stun it. If you need a boost to your dwindling health and can’t get a moment to breathe and drink a healing potion, you can drop a healing mist that delivers an AoE effect to anyone in its radius.</p>
<p>The Karakuri system feels like it adds a much-needed ‘X factor’ to the fights to keep them feeling distinct, as they give you something else than just waling away at a Kemono for 10 minutes until it dies. Not only will different people favour different constructs, thus furthering player expression, but continuously unlocking new ones via an extensive skill tree means that there’s always something else to work towards beyond simply more weapons and armour. I really appreciated the various mobility and support options they offer, and hope to see more of this kind of thing in the genre as it evolves further.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157572/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d be remiss not to also mention the extensive selection of weapons on offer, which can really change up your combat approach and give you a lot more replayability to take the edge off of things feeling repetitive as you grind Kemono for rare drops. You can go with more traditional approaches, like the katana or bow, or more unconventional things like the Wagasa, which is a bladed umbrella that uniquely allows you to parry many Kemono attacks.</p>
<p>Each weapon has its own playstyle and quirks, and taking the time to explore them all really goes to show how much depth there is to the combat here, especially when paired with possibilities opened up by the Karakuri constructs.</p>
<p>It's tempting to hope that the ‘S’ in this release’s title indicates some sort of expansion content, perhaps akin to the ‘G rank’ quests that Capcom is keen to later include in its Monster Hunter games. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and this Nintendo debut for Wild Hearts is more of a modest balance patch than anything else.</p>
<figure><a title="Wild Hearts S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155223/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The main feature here is that you can now play co-op with four people (up from three in the original release), while monster behaviours and the stats of some weapons have been adjusted to make the experience a bit more enjoyable. If you already put a lot of time into Wild Hearts on other platforms anytime since it released in 2023, there’s not a lot you’re missing out on with the Switch 2 port besides the option to play it on the go.</p>
<p>And though it’s a lovely convenience that Wild Hearts is now playable on a portable console, it’s a bit disappointing that this release isn’t terribly well optimised. The original had its own share of performance issues and that’s clearly been carried over to the Switch 2; frame rates are all over the place and the visuals themselves are a little middling between the somewhat fuzzy resolution and flat textures.</p>
<p>It’s not a <em>mess</em> by any means, but seeing the visual hiccups—especially when the frame rate takes a sharp dive—can take you out of the experience a bit. This one might have benefited from a bit more time in the oven.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wild Hearts S is a satisfying, if unspectacular, addition to the Switch 2’s early library. The monster hunting and equipment building is just as rewarding and addictive as you would hope, and there’s <em>tons</em> of replayability here whether you’re playing solo or with friends.</p>
<p>That being said, the technical performance is just <em>okay,</em> while the lack of any significant content additions to this re-release feels like a missed opportunity, especially if you previously played this on other platforms. I’d still give Wild Hearts a recommendation, as its blemishes don’t ultimately take too much away from its many strengths, but perhaps this is one to wait for a sale.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>, the next major expansion for digital trading card game&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming to Android and iOS next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 29th. This looks to be a full expansion along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, rather than a themed booster pack like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis" rel="nofollow"><em>Extradimensional Crisis</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed, the expansion is based around the Generation 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia, who will be making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=euI8PCH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=vWoWbzGZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia will make their debut in next week's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>They'll be joined by the three Gen 2 starters Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, who are all represented by frankly adorable artwork. If you're a fan of the Gen 2 starters and want to see Chikorita and Totodile ahead of their&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">appearance in October</a>, this one's for you (sorry, Cyndaquil fans).</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the likes of a full art Pichu card, as well as new cards for Gen 2 stalwarts like Cleffa, the infamous red Gyarados that plays a key role in Gen 2's storyline, and more.</p>

<p>Eeveelutions Umbreon and Espeon will be getting new ex cards, and, of course, new Trainer cards will be making an appearance, including Supporters Lyra and Silver, as well as the new Rescue Scarf and Elemental Switch items.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for <em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>'s theming and check out some of its new card art, you can do so right here via the expansion's trailer. I'm warning you, though: those starters really are dangerously cute.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to download and play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>arrives across both systems on July 29th.</p>

With <em>Dorfromantik</em>, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the high score, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Dorfromantik</em> you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.</p><p>On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up.</p><p>As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Building endless and beautiful landscapes.</li><li>Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics.</li><li>Relaxing and calming gameplay.</li><li>Idyllic village scenery.</li><li>Strategic placement to beat the high score.</li><li>High replay value—every session is different.</li><li>Many unlockable tiles and biomes.</li><li>Original art style with hand-painted <a title="Genres > Board Game [58 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/board-game">board game</a> feel.</li></ul><p><strong>Not Features</strong></p><ul><li>4X strategy.</li><li>Trading.</li><li>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>.</li><li>Combat and violence.</li><li><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><p><em>Dorfromantik</em> offers options for any style of play!

                <p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy was a very popular expansion to the three-decades-old card game, and based on its current sold-out status in most local game stores and big-box retailers, that popularity is still going strong. During Hasbro's <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/events/event-details/hasbro-second-quarter-2025-earnings-conference-call" rel="nofollow ">recent quarterly investor call</a> for Q2 2025, the company revealed that the set has already become the best-selling set in the game's history--and it only took one day to get there.</p><p dir="ltr">Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks revealed during the call that Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy sold $200 million worth of product in a single day. For reference, the previous MTG collaboration set--2023's The Lord Of The Rings--needed six months to reach the $200 million milestone. Cocks went on to say that the set could have made even more on day one, but the company "left demand on the table."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537645"></a><figcaption>Zidane, Tantalus Thief</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537645-zidane.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We couldn’t produce enough," Cocks said. "I think we increased production runs on it four times pre-release. It was substantially--by many, many very high double-digit percentages--ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p dir="ltr">Those still looking for Final Fantasy cards despite its current sold-out status will be happy to know that Hasbro is planning to keep production going on the set, as Hasbro CFO Gina Goetter confirmed during the call. "We’re continuing to produce this set," Goetter said. "We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail."</p><p dir="ltr">While players wait for Final Fantasy to be restocked, the next in-universe MTG set is nearly upon us, as the space-opera-themed Edge of Eternities launches August 1. After that, the Marvel's Spider-Man expansion will launch September 12, while an Avatar: The Last Airbender set will round out the year on November 21.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Mafia series has long been a contemporary of franchises like GTA and Saints Row, but its focus has always been much more narrow than those sprawling games. From the very first Mafia game, the goal was to deliver a playable classic mob movie, making for a familiar pastiche of themes and characters. The first game was technically an open world in that you drove between mission hubs, but it was largely focused on its narrative. For its latest game, Mafia: The Old Country, 2K is similarly focused. GameSpot spoke with executive producer Devin Hitch and game director Alex Cox about the change in setting and a renewed focus on making combat feel intimate and personal.</p><p dir="ltr">The previous games have slowly become more modern, starting in the 1930s and then venturing into the 1940s and 1950s in Mafia 2 and finally the 1960s in Mafia 3. Aside from brief interstitial stories, they've also all taken place across a fictionalized United States. That makes this setting, 1900s Sicily, a significant change for the series, but one that won't be unfamiliar to fans of organized-crime fiction.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="711063438"

We go back to the project, the franchise pillars to figure out what would make for a new 'Mafia' game, what we want it to be different about this one. And in some ways, what we want about it to be the same. And when we look at Mafia, the Mafia series and what was done in the previous three games, they start to become this story of organized crime in the 20th century. Visiting different historical eras that are very iconic, very familiar to a mainstream audience. Players will have seen Godfather, 'Goodfellas', Untouchables, all of the kinds of movies that define very iconic eras in organized-crime history."</p><p dir="ltr">Making a prequel was a conscious decision too, to give new players a fresh start if they haven't played a Mafia game before. Cox hints that returning players will notice some references to later games as well, since the Mafia series has had a loose but unmistakable continuity.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sicilian Mafia is the forbearer of the US mafia, the criminal tradition that gave the Mafia its name. [They] coined the term that became the way that we all describe organized crime internationally now, [and it] was born in Sicily at a very particular time and for very particular reasons. And so we found that interesting. We found it interesting because it's a different environment than the American urban cities that we've visited in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">"And also in everybody's head there is this mystique and fascination with those, the Sicilian mafia, it's less well known. There's more to discover for players who are interested, particularly fans of crime genre, it's something that's less well trod than those other eras that maybe we've done before. And if you've seen any of the Godfather movies, you know that there's sections, each of them has sections set in Sicily and the tradition, the way that the guys refer to it. The old country comes from the way that American mobsters often refer to Sicily as they're talking to one another in crime movies and TV shows."</p><p dir="ltr">Those pop-culture touchstones are no accident. More than many other series, Mafia has always been very clearly inspired and paying homage to classic organized-crime stories like The Godfather and Goodfellas. Cox acknowledges that it "wears its heart on its sleeve" and the series has intentionally made some of its characters and plot points recognizable. As the series has continued, though, it's progressed into more original storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have moved away from that, over the years, to tell more original stories," Cox said. "However, part of the promise that we want to make to players is that you are playing a character in those movies. If you're a fan of the crime genre, you're going to have that fantasy. That's the fantasy in your head, isn't it? To be the main character in those movies. And so we always try and find a nice mix there of touch points that are familiar, our own original content and our own original, let's say universe, and our stories that we tell inside there. So that's the balance really."</p><p dir="ltr">The largest change to Mafia: The Old Country probably comes to its combat, which seems aimed at becoming more personal and up-close. Mafia has always aimed for more grounded storytelling than its contemporaries--in the very first Mafia game, a rival mob sending a handful of enforcers to assault your crew was seen as a major escalation in an ongoing conflict. The Old Country pushes that idea even further with the introduction of knife fights, a grisly close-quarters style of fighting that was common before the advent of automatic weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537267" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537267"></a><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537267-ss_8c5af3a1b47337fe9d2f4f48d21975964eb23ccb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We are set in a rural setting and everybody lives to some extent in an agricultural or a rural economy," Cox explained. "So the weapons of the farmer or the poacher is part of it too, to try and evoke that feeling of this quite impoverished. When you imagine Sicily in your head, it's this dusty, hard-scrabble environment. And that's really what we wanted to put across in the whole combat design in addition to the firearms themselves. And then likewise, there's a long tradition of knife-fighting and using knives in Sicily, which derive from their common use in this agricultural setting. And then also lots of different types of knives that specialize for different usages, but then obviously became associated with Sicilian gangsters and organized crime over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of knife fights went through several different iterations. The team started with giant knives, "almost like swords" as Cox describes it, which were the ones most associated with Sicilian knife-fighting. That idea became impractical during development, but the end result is a more versatile system with several types of knives that imbue you with different skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Hitch added that the team did research around Sicilian knife-fighting, especially in the pre-production phase, and found that it was considered almost like a martial art, and local artisans put great care into the production of these knives as tools and weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">"We sent some folks to Sicily, actually, to look at how these knives were crafted, because there's a really beautiful artistic quality to some of these," Hitch said. "And then we actually met with some of the knife smiths, the guys who are actually making these, and they've been doing it in a very similar way for the last 150 years or so. So there's some really cool, interesting stuff that lit a creative fire for us in pre-production. And then we're really proud to see how that's translated to the screen, and it is a new mechanic in the game that we haven't had before."</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes that research revealed gruesome details as well. Cox said there was one particularly grisly description of an argument between rival clans that broke out over who laid claim to a bench in a church, leading to a massive knife fight in the town square with multiple casualties. To capture this level of violence, Hitch said the tech and character artists worked out ways to produce procedural blood marks from your fights, which appear on characters' bodies and pool on their clothes. All of this was made to help achieve one of its key goals, which is to make the violence feel real and impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">"That was something that was really attractive in terms of storytelling, because one of the things in previous Mafia games that we have always wanted to do, was get more up close and personal with some of the key antagonists, or let's say 'bosses' in the game," Hitch said. "And because we're such a realistic game, we're not a superhero game or things like that, there was not necessarily as much opportunity to get really up close and personal when you're doing gunplay. There's this distance."</p><p dir="ltr">Cox added that the knife fights present "a great opportunity for us to get up close and personal with story characters and fight out the last minutes of their lives, looking at their faces with the cutscenes and cinematic presentation you'd expect from that, which in the past we were not able to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Guns are still present in Mafia: The Old Country, but the setting means they aren't as omnipresent as they have been in previous games--particularly Mafia 3. Hitch noted that in that game, set in the 1960s, Lincoln Clay was a Vietnam veteran, and the gameplay was built around the time period and his experiences. That meant he had ready access to lots of weapons, ammo, and grenades at any given time. The Old Country, by comparison, wants to make you feel more scrappy, needing to scrounge for limited resources and make calculations about what to do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">"That was something that we really felt jived super well with this hard-scrabble, resource-depleted environment of 1900 Sicily," Cox said. "So we introduced ideas, the resources to the player are scarcer than Mafia: Definitive Edition, for example. So you have to be a bit more considerate in how you use your ammunition. We introduced the idea of looting enemies to find bullets and other combat resources as you play through those encounters. And generally we dialed up the challenge a little bit so the feeling is a kind of surviving in some of these dangerous encounters. Rather than if I was to use the Lincoln Clay, Mafia III example of charging in there in a military sense. Enzo [the Old Country protagonist] has to play through these combat encounters in a more tactical and considered manner because of those things, limited resources and slightly raised combat challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">There are still large-scale gunfights, which Cox said exercises some "artistic license" on Sicilian history, and once in a while you will need to stock up and prepare for a large encounter. But it requires some more prep and looting bodies, as opposed to Lincoln Clay calling in a supply drop.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you're Enzo, there is a point at which everything that you brought with you starts to run dry," Hitch said. "And that's when you start thinking, 'Okay, how am I going to get to that next body to get a few more bullets or a bandage or something like that so that I can keep going?' And that's one of the things that I really like about the combat--ultimately my play style, I go in quiet and eventually I get spotted and then I have to start shooting my way out and then that's when I start getting scarce on resources. So I think it definitely makes you think, and that's one of the things that we wanted in our combat was to be intentional in that regard."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537266"></a><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4537266-ss_44047e62744c4a7201a0238994d23f3ca72649cb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cox said that the system is made to be dynamic, so resources will wane as necessary to make sure you're kept in a "zone of scarcity" to keep combat tense. That also helped facilitate the idea of knife fights as your trusty sidearm that never runs out of ammo, "something you can turn to in these moments of desperation." Ultimately the goal is to have an ebb and flow of different types of combat encounters with different feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got choreographed shootouts where ammo scarcity and things like that aren't part of the design formula," Cox said. "And then we have extended periods in various missions where you are playing your own ways. Where you can choose whether you go stealthy, whether you go loud, how to approach the objective. So again, like every previous Mafia game, there's a rollercoaster of different experiences from game to end."</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia: The Old Country is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 8.</p>

            <p>The developer of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has acknowledged issues with the game's performance and promised a patch is on the way.</p>
<p>The soulslike, from Chinese studio Leenzee and publisher 505 Games, released yesterday and has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-follows-in-black-myth-wukongs-footsteps-with-strong-steam-launch">racked up a significant concurrent player count on Steam</a> that exceeds other games in the genre. However, player reviews are Mostly Negative, citing issues with the game's performance owing to its use of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"We have received reports regarding issues such as the game's optimisation not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing," said the team in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">statement on Steam</a>. "These problems should never have occurred, and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing."</p>

<p>It continued: "We are confident in the game's performance within our recommended spec but we're working on optimisation. We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can."</p>
<p>The team has linked to an <a href="https://support.505games.com/support/solutions/150000215541">FAQ</a> to assist with any issues. Eurogamer previously detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-its-release-later-this-month-wuchang-fallen-feathers-pc-specs-revealed-and-theyre-surprisingly-modest">PC specs for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>
<p>Leenzee is also aware of pricing anomalies in some regions and is working with Steam to restore the correct pricing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio found a bug in the reward distribution preventing players from receiving the correct items after pre-ordering the standard and deluxe editions. This will also be fixed in the future patch. Those impacted will receive a free digital soundtrack as a token of goodwill, while deluxe edition purchasers will receive an additional exclusive bonus costume.</p>
<p>"We are fully committed to investigating and resolving these issues as quickly as possible," said the studio. "Our team is prioritising these problems at the highest level, striving to fix and handle everything promptly to ensure you have the best possible gaming experience.</p>

<p>Yep, as reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/man-breaks-switch-2-after-spray-painting-donkey-kong-bananza-to-mimic-n64-cart-3229436/">Dexerto</a>, a man has attempted to return to the glory days of yellow Donkey Kong game carts by spray painting his Donkey Kong Bananza cartridge a lovely banana shade of yellow. Good idea. If you were looking for a bad idea, that is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Our tale of woe begins on the TikTok of the man in question, where he's posted some pictures of some old yellow DK carts and his disappointingly red Bananza one. Disgusting.</p>

<p>Next, Gardner explains his reasoning in a video posted to his TikTok, before getting to work on spraying:</p>
<p>“If you look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/donkey_kong_land">Donkey Kong Land</a> or Donkey Kong 64, you’ll see they both have these vibrant yellow cartridges,” he says, "I just am unable to play Bananza knowing that I’m putting a red cartridge in my Switch.”</p>

<p>Things start to go wrong when the cart won't fit as it's being pushed in thanks to the fact the label has been messed with. Of course, it then gets completely stuck inside the console.</p>
<p>After attempting to pry at it, pliers are called in, at which point the cart breaks whilst still in the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Now, to round the story off in a less traumatic way than just finishing with a man and his borked Switch 2, Gardner has posted one final video on the matter, in which he addresses some of those who have decided to mock him for his mistake, whilst also going pro-mode on removing the cart from his console.</p>

<p>Thank Goomba for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>,&nbsp;</em>it has been a fairly sparse year as far as <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">first-person shooters</a> go, but&nbsp;an upcoming title hopes to change that by rebooting yet another classic series.&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is back from the dead, and this time you'll want to take a few friends along for the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right; differing from the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>from 2004, this is a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/cooperative/games" rel="nofollow">cooperative</a> take on the franchise, which is a bold new direction for the series. With customizable weapon configurations, you'll fight your way through various levels of Purgatory while contending with demonic hordes of foes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=Wxdhmhb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=rlBSq-bX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Environments look quite beautiful, I must say.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Painkiller</em>, Back From the Dead</h2>

<p>The basic gist of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s gameplay is that it's a cooperative shooter supporting up to three players. You and a group of friends tackle linear, but "dynamic" levels with objectives along the way, eventually leading to an ending sequence that might put you against hordes of enemies or even a fearsome boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our preview for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;comprises two levels as well as access to every weapon and character. First things first, though, a tutorial/prologue session. This tutorial immediately establishes a tone for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller.&nbsp;</em>One could mistake&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game at first glance, but it sets itself apart by offering comedic quips and humorous writing.</p>

<p><em>Painkiller's&nbsp;</em>lighthearted tone and humorous dialogue clash with its grimdark, Gothic setting of Purgatory, but it's a tone I don't mind at all. Silly&nbsp;dialogue from characters like angel Metatron helps set it apart from other FPS titles with a similar aesthetic. I even found myself chuckling at a few lines of dialogue, and nothing was enough for me to roll my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=MK9cq-X0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=SBXQKGZg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face is always devastating.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Purgatory's Arsenal&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The tutorial goes over the basic elements of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, as any good intro sequence should. Making a return is the eponymous Painkiller weapon, this sort of handheld propeller from Hell. It slices and dices through groups of weak enemies like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<p>Eventually, we're granted two starting weapons: One is the Stakegun, which, true to its name, shoots out giant stakes. The other is the Electrodriver, which rapidly shoots out shurikens and slices through hordes of enemies with ease. At the end of the tutorial, these are your only two weapons players have access to, but you'll unlock more as you complete levels and purchase them.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=1uZn_YUe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=52xXzDpZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the eponymous Painkiller.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapons are a huge emphasis here, as they should be -- it's an FPS, after all. With only six weapons at our disposal, it's slim pickings. We can only equip two weapons each run, too. There's no way to change your loadout mid-level, which is a shame since gameplay can start to feel repetitive.</p>

<p>Despite some repetition in the gunplay, it does feel satisfying to mow through hordes of smaller enemies and, even with the larger and more powerful foes, your weapons seem to pack a punch. I wish gore was a bit more visible just to see the impact of your weapons, but shotgunning a group of zombies in the face is never boring.</p>

<p>There's also weapon progression, so as you play, you can upgrade and tweak the way your guns behave after each run. Guns have their own skill tree, essentially, and choosing a path will further upgrade a gun's functionality and make it more powerful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=Qfa58DfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=pUyoyrW3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shotgun and its tree of upgrades.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Guns, Tarot Cards, and You</h2>

<p>These upgrades have an effect on your primary fire's behavior, but each gun also comes with a secondary fire, of which there are several to choose from. The shotgun, for instance, can repulse enemies with kinetic force and send them flying off cliffs. Another choice for the secondary is the Freezer attachment, which freezes enemies in a wide area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then come core fire upgrades, so you can have it so that the shotgun shoots slugs, or, for another choice, have it shoot in a wider radius. Each weapon has both these core upgrades and enhancements to secondary fire, so variation is actually quite large. They also come with visual upgrades, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>These upgrades do come pretty fast, so I worry about how exciting gunplay will feel in the long run, especially when you're stuck with your loadout between each run. Nonetheless, experimenting with different weapon builds is what drove me to continue playing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=aGGygW2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=14G_2M3M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A bit like gacha, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another part of your toolkit is tarot cards, which sound exciting on paper, but didn't do much to impress me. You can spend in-game money to roll for new tarot cards to add you your deck, and you can equip two of these. Some of these add base stat increases like more health or damage, while others seem to be very situational.</p>

<p>For instance, one card, Frost Fall, has the effect "Landing from height freezes nearby enemies." Another, called Profane Blessing, grants your weapon 30 percent more damage. Some cards are way more useful than others, as you can see, usually the more powerful ones are also the most mundane.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=8yW19NHP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=HqM0gdnx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>And here's a look at the SMG.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tearing Through the Grounds of Purgatory</h2>

<p><em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;touts dynamic levels, so in theory, no run is the same. The two levels available in the demo were, by and large, 99 percent the same. The same exact layout, just with some treasure chests or gold hidden in different areas. I really&nbsp;<em>wish</em>&nbsp;there were more variance to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s levels, because I have a feeling this might get old real quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels are pretty fast, after all, and take around 30 minutes to complete. During this half hour, you'll be running through the level, slaughtering a bunch of weaker enemies, and taking on the occasional powerful foe.</p>

<p>Levels typically have a few objectives you'll need to complete along the way. These instances take place within some well-crafted combat arenas. These arenas take advantage of<em>&nbsp;Painkiller</em>'s run-and-gun. The developer knows how to craft an exciting environment to rip and tear through, I'll give them that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=Pd-7MFXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=wU-fx_rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat arenas look pretty cool! There's a good mix of hazards and platforms to make battle a bit more interesting.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, levels are well-made, but feel old upon repetition. I'm not sure if&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is meant to be played as a one-and-done sort of deal, but the way the gameplay systems are designed leads me to believe multiple runs to upgrade your weapons is the way to go.</p>

<p>If that's the case, I hope Anshar Studios has more than a handful of levels for us to explore, otherwise, I can see&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s online population dropping off quite quickly after finishing their initial run through the campaign. As a game that requires a healthy player base to survive, I'm a bit worried based on what I've played.</p>

<p>You can play with bots, but that's not quite the same experience as playing with humans. Bots are competent enough, but did have trouble following my order to stand on a certain switch or target specific enemies. I also had one instance where a bot died on a spike trap, so another bot went over to try to revive it. They both got stuck and died until their lives ran out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=ibVkOWq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=5nY0ad0P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fillin' up on blood.</figcaption></figure><p>Bots are even more of a nuisance when it comes to completing one certain objective. Your progress will halt when you reach certain checkpoints in the map, so you might have to survive a few hordes of enemies, and then you can move on. Others require you to fill tanks of blood by killing enemies in their proximity, which is simply not fun.</p>

<p>You, as the player, can carry these blood tanks, while the bots can't. Stopping your shooting to reposition these tanks with janky physics is a nuisance, and for some reason, there are quite a few of these objectives within the maps. I'm sure it's less painful to play with actual players, at least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But still,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> desperately needs more variety in the different types of tasks players. Most of the gameplay comprises surviving said hordes of enemies, or filling these blood tanks. That's all. Give us more objectives to do, and make it dynamic. Things get stale pretty fast otherwise.</p>

<p>There is merit to cooperative titles with hordes of enemies. Look at the success of games like&nbsp;<em>Left 4 Dead</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>. The difference, though, is that levels are longer and more grander in scope, and enemies are more diverse and complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also elements of unpredictability in those types of games, which&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;lacks. The core gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is solid, and levels are decent enough the first time around, but consecutive runs? I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>I desperately wish for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s success. Levels are richly detailed. Each weapon has more than a few unique quirks about them. Combat areas are vertical, visceral, and well-crafted. But to truly garner attention, I hope for a greater degree of randomization between each run, as well as a stronger progression system. Time will tell when it launches this October.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Take</em> is a horror game by actors, about actors, and for fans of video games and horror alike, as you step into the aftermath of a glitzy Hollywood Hills party in search of your friend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahead of the game's July 31 release, I had a chance to converse with Abubakar Salim, the Creative Director of <em>Dead Take</em> and the founder of Surgent Studios, about <em>Dead Take's</em> main characters, unique gameplay elements, and the potentially risky story to tell.</p>


<h2>Actors Playing Actors Auditioning For A Role</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> will follow the journey of two actors: Chase, played by Neil Newbon, and Vinny, played by Ben Starr.</p>

<p>"You'll play as Chase. The game begins as you arrive at the mansion in search of Vinny after a glitzy party, and the story will unfold as you solve puzzles and splice live-action videos together to get deeper inside," Salim said.</p>

<p>While it isn't 100% clear the full nature of the relationship between Chase and Vinny, Salim did expand that "<em>Dead Take</em> is about two actors going for the same role." The announcement of Newbon and Starr as cast in <em>Dead Take</em> introduced them not only as playing their own characters, but that both play the role of Willie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-interview-ben-starr.jpg?itok=VXSnmt8f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-interview-ben-starr.jpg?itok=9qTm3tQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ben Starr screaming as if to escape from the game itself</figcaption></figure><p>Video game fans will be familiar with Neil Newbon with his incredible performance of Astarion in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2158b818-8ae7-45f2-997e-44a5977e48f4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and many know Ben Starr for his roles as Clive in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c87144b4-8f70-4aae-9ed0-f3bc6e8d065e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> and Verso in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></a></p>

<p>In the universe of <em>Dead Take</em> it seems that Chase and Vinny are both trying to book the role of Willie.</p>

<p>"It’s been fascinating to have actors playing actors, because so many things in the game hit so close to home for them," Salim said.</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll get to see these characters showing different approaches to a single role.</p>

<p>Drawing on their own experience, Salim was complimentary of Newbon and Starr not just in their performances but "also when sharing their own experiences in the industry." This involvement throughout the development process helped "shape the narrative in a big way."</p>

<p>There is a dark twist to the performances that we'll see, too. Knowing that the game would be told from the point of view of one actor and we'd get to see multiple live-action performances, I questioned how reliable will what we're seeing as the players be if it's just from Chase's perspective or the perspective of a camera.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-interview-footage.jpg?itok=_VRIV2zI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-interview-footage.jpg?itok=nRixas8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"When you have big aspirations for yourself, like so many actors have to, you create these grand narratives in order to understand how you fit into the industry," Salim explained. "So much of what unfolds in <em>Dead Take</em> is about those grand narratives, picking them apart to see the awful truth underneath."</p>

<h2>Telling a Dark Hollywood Tale</h2>

<p>Knowing just how specific a story this is, one of "a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers," as the Steam store page cites, I was interested to hear where this idea originated from and what it was like to develop.</p>

<p>"It felt a bit dangerous to me, and once I’d had the idea, it wouldn’t go away. When I told people about it, their reactions were either 'You have to do this,' or 'Ditch this idea, you’re gonna get blacklisted,'" Salim said. "But for me, the most important thing was to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Not everyone with power uses it responsibly, and there’s something about being an artist that makes it doubly insidious."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their reactions were either "You have to do this,” or “Ditch this idea, you’re gonna get blacklisted.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that Salim has credits as an actor, director, and producer across live-action, animated, and actual-play content, I was interested to hear what led him to pursue this story in the medium of video games. He explained that he was looking to create a deeper connection to the player.</p>

Not wanting to tell the players how they should feel or interact with the world, but instead to experience the narrative from his view and to then draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>"It feels more collaborative to me, and I like the feeling of connecting to players in that way."</p>

<h2>Mansion Exploration</h2>

<p>Seeing snippets of walking through creepy, darkened hallways and reassembling a trident to open a path forward, I immediately thought of games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33eaca7a-990f-42da-a131-81cbcae617b8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a> or newer <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1e84774-c3b4-4fe9-aa03-b12cca7e88b8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys" rel="nofollow"><em>FNAF </em></a>games, putting players in a tense situation with puzzles to solve.</p>

"Although there are plenty of puzzles that play on the bizarre mix of items you find in a movie mogul’s house, we also wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role," Salim said.</p>

<p>Referencing the different live-action footage filmed of actors, players will be "finding and splicing together live-action videos." You'll not only be able to solve the mechanical puzzles of the game, but also learn more about who the actors are that you're playing as or trying to find.</p>

<p>"We wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role. For a lot of us, how well you’re doing can be measured by what you’re actually filming: audition tapes? Screen tests? Interviews? There’s something about behind-the-scenes content, showing actors slip in and out of character like it’s nothing, that is so creepy and unsettling, so we wanted to play with that in a puzzle," Salim said.</p>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> releases on July 31 for Steam. Joining Newbon and Starr, other familiar faces that you might see include Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce, as well as Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham.</p>

            <p>The last patch is never the last patch. CD Projekt have been teaching us that lesson for about a year with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is the latest game to have its devs go 'no, wait, one more'. To be fair to Supergiant, they did specify that the roguelike's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld">previous update would "likely" be the last one</a> before full release.</p>
<p>It wasn't. An eleventh early access patch has hit the underworld, but the devs swear it'll be the last one for realsies this time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512964244473382774?l=english">notes for patch 11</a>, there's still no release date for Hades 2's full launch, but Supergiant are clearly full steam ahead in their dungeon run towards that goal. The headline note in the patch is some direct prep, with the devs reminding folks that when the game's "True Ending" is deployed, any crafting materials like zodiac sand or void lenses you've collected will be converted to prestige automatically when you first load up your save in 1.0.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch more changes to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms' abilities and aspects, with the Umbral Flames, Moonstone Axe, and Black Coat all receiving nice buffs. As usual, those tweaks are accompanied by a bunch of fiddling with boons, blessings, and Daedalus hammer upgrades.</p>
<p>Hexes'll now be quicker to cast and I'm glad to report that Supgiant have buffed a cat. Well, Toula the wildcat, whom Melinoë can recruit as a familiar in Erebus, but same difference. They're all furry, purry, and wouldn't really care that much if you died, yeah?</p>
<p>The devs have also dialled down the amount of enemies you'll face in any single wave while battling through Olympus, on the summit, or when running into Icarus. The former'll also have more places for you to take cover. There are tweaks to a bunch of common enemies, and Supergiant look to have done more tuning down than tuning up.</p>
<p>You can also no longer die in the time it takes Athena to rock up after she says she's on her way, which sounds handy in avoiding instances of goddesses saying 'Oh nuts, you alright there kiddo?'</p>
<p>Here's hoping we do get that full release date soon, since this (fingers crossed) does look to be the final Hades 2 patch before 1.0. Or maybe it'll just shadow-drop at 3AM on a random Tuesday. As Greek lad Socrates once said, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is obsessed with time. From the opening moments, which drops the audience <em>in media res</em>, brilliant scientist Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) is scouring the cabinets of his 1960s-retro-future-inspired bathroom for iodine. The man known as Mister Fantastic calls out to his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), to ask where it is. The Invisible Woman quickly responds that she needs twelve seconds. Reed retorts that’s incredibly specific, and it’s the first of many mentions of definitive lengths of time throughout the movie.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It turns out, after two years of trying to have children, one-half of the Fantastic Four is expecting a child. This means Reed’s best friend Ben Grimm, aka The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Sue’s brother Johnny, or the Human Torch (Joseph Quinn), are going to be uncles. It’s an exciting, well, <em>time</em> for the family.</p><p><em>First Steps</em> takes place at a critical inflection point for Sue and Reed, sure, but also for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it goes through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672">a creative readjustment</a></span>. Post <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, Marvel films have arrived with a considerable amount of hand-wringing, but the burden of proof feels even heavier for the <em>Fantastic Four</em>, laden with rescuing the MCU from its multiverse doldrums. Doubly so, when the disguised competition <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204">just hit a grand slam with the launch of their new cinematic universe</a></span>.</p><p>You’d be hard-pressed to know all this watching a movie that’s this light on its feet. The fourth reboot of Marvel’s first family (but the first from Marvel Studios) is helmed by <em>WandaVision</em> director Matt Shakman, with a script from a quartet of writers: Josh Friedman, Eric Pearson, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer. The result is an entertaining return to form for the MCU, bolstered by stellar visuals and even better performances.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-recommend-id="image://3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-recommend-id="image://3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After the reveal that Sue and Reed are pregnant, <em>First Steps</em> kicks into a savvy and breezy bit of exposition, detailing the origins of the team through an Ed Sullivan-esque magazine program. Here we see the team’s past as astronauts, and how they were affected by cosmic radiation that gave them superpowers; a speedy prologue before throwing the four into the movie’s central conflict. Alien harbinger The Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) appears in Times Square to declare the planet marked for destruction by the world-eater Galactus (Ralph Ineson). In an attempt to save their world, the Fantastic Four rocket deep into space to persuade Galactus otherwise, only to learn the celestial creature wants Sue and Reed’s unborn child. Should they refuse, he’ll devour the Earth. Time’s tick, tick, ticking away.</p><p>So begins the central tension of <em>First Steps</em>. The denizens of Earth-828 (fittingly named in honor of <em>Fantastic Four</em> creator Jack Kirby’s birthdate of August 28, and distinct from Earth-616 where most MCU movies are set) aren’t particularly keen on the notion that they’ll die if Galactus isn’t appeased. What was once nervous excitement on behalf of the soon-to-be parents becomes outright fear at the possibility of having to give up something once thought impossible. Thus, the movie becomes a race against time to find a solution that spares Earth but without having to lose their child.</p><p>This worst possible situation brings out the best in <em>First Steps</em>, allowing each of its leads the depth and breadth they need. As the second act unfolds, the thrill is in seeing how each of the main characters reacts to the crisis. For Sue, that’s to find strength in the familial love she’s cultivated, while for Reed it’s about trying to solve everything, even if that means considering the worst possible options. Pascal and Kirby navigate these difficult situations with a welcome sense of maturity—especially by MCU standards—and shine all the brighter because of it. Sue and Reed are a perfect pair—even in the thorniest of arguments, there’s never any doubt about the strength of their relationship. Their big, emotional moments play exceedingly well.</p><p>Johnny and Ben take on more secondary roles, but not in a way that shortchanges their development. Moss-Bachrach’s version of The Thing has melancholy moments of self-reflection, but not at the expense of being the sturdy foundation of this family. He might come across as the brawn, but Ben’s all heart. Johnny, on the other hand, is eager to prove he’s more than a flirty ladies man, and seeing his passions come ablaze is a delight—he shows he’s just as capable as the rest of his superlative super family.</p><figure id="" data-id="aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-recommend-id="image://aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1393" data-height="784" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-recommend-id="image://aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1393" data-height="784" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>First Steps</em>’ <em>Jetsons</em>-like, ‘60s retro-future aesthetics make this feel unlike any other Marvel film. Full of color—a blue hue saturates the world—it’s a far cry from the washed-out sheen of most MCU projects. Director Shakman’s framing also results in some awe-inspiring moments: when the family first gazes upward at Galactus, it’s worthy of inclusion alongside Marvel’s most memorable moments. This is a movie full of cosmic scale and spectacle, very much befitting the world Jack Kirby and Stan Lee rendered across dozens of comics back in 1961 when they introduced the team. That grandness is also helped by Michael Giacchino’s score, one of Marvel’s very best.</p><p>Perhaps <em>First Steps</em> stumbles a little in the third act, with the predictability of the plot, the rushed nature of its conclusion, and underutilization of its villains. Galactus is fine—he doesn’t need much more motivation outside of needing to devour. But the Silver Surfer Julia Garner portrays is thinly-drawn, especially when contrasted alongside the Fantastic Four. The sub-two-hour runtime means that once things everything’s in motion, the film moves through big events in quick fashion, brushing past moments that could have used a few more minutes to breathe. Ironically, the film doesn’t have enough time.</p><p>Whether it’s the seconds Reed needs to try to save the world, or the years that could quickly fly by as their newborn child grows up, there’s never going to be enough time to go around. Yet, for the first time in a while, I’ve walked out of a Marvel movie thrilled and entertained by what’s transpired on the screen in front of me.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is out now, and it's having a big start on Steam.

            <p>
Itch.io, the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists, has "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam.
</p>
<p>
Hints that something was afoot on the platform first surfaced on social media earlier today, as itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results. Alarm bells immediately began ringing given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">recent similar events on Steam</a>, which saw Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its store.
</p>
<p>
Itch.io's response, meanwhile, has been even more drastic. It's confirmed the deindexing, albeit temporarily, of "all" adult NSFW content from its browse and search pages. "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change," platform founder Leaf Corcoran wrote in a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">statement shared on the website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io," it continued. "Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April</a>, the organisation Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."
</p>
<p>
Collective Shout is an Australian pressure group claiming to be "against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls" and "for anyone against the pornification of culture". Its previous video game activities have included calling for a ban on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">promoting a 2018 petition</a> to pull Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, arguing it depicted "child abuse and violence against women". More successful were its efforts to ban Tyler the Creator from touring the country in 2015.
</p>
<p>
In July, Collective Shout mounted a campaign against Steam and itch.io - presented as an "open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest, and child abuse games" - and later took credit for Steam's decision to pull certain adult games, calling it a "win". And its decision to pressure the likes of MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal has now had a similar impact on itch.io.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," itch.io continued. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritise our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance. This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform's core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologise for the abruptness of this change."
</p>
<p>
Itch.io says all NSFW pages on the platform will remain deindexed while it conducts a "comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors", confirming the process will result in "some pages being permanently removed". After that, "new compliance measures" will be introduced, including mandating that all creators "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account."
</p>
<p>
"We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period. I'm sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves. We will post a follow up on our blog if the situation changes."
