            <p>A playable demo for adventure brawler Scott Pilgrim EX is now available.</p>
<p>Currently only available on Steam, you'll be able to take a virtual mid-winter trip to Toronto and sample the brand-new storyline co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games, as well as all-new music from Scott Pilgrim alumni, Anamanaguchi.</p>

<p>It's unclear if progress carries over, but I have reached out to Tribute for confirmation.</p>
<p>"Jump into Scott Pilgrim’s wonderfully weird version of Toronto and play through the first two quests of Scott Pilgrim EX either solo or with friends," Tribute Games teases. "Play as iconic heroes and exes from throughout the Scott Pilgrim franchise - with the demo sporting Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Lucas Lee, and Roxy Richter from the full game’s seven character playable roster - as you bash the robots, demons and vegans that stand in your way. Each character has their own feel and moveset, so don’t limit yourself to just one playthrough."</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. The new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots". Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city.</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim EX will initially release as a digital-only game on 3rd March for Nintendo Switch, PC (Steam), PS4/5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws is a cosy game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/15/star-wars-outlaws-is-a-cosy-game/</link>
            <guid>1436647</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Star Wars Outlaws is a cosy game? I’m sure you may be sat there thinking what are you talking about? After all Star Wars Outlaws follows Kay Vess, Nix, and ND-5 as they complete contracts for criminal syndicates while also working towards pulling off a major heist. Not to mention the masses of gun and space battles against the criminal syndicates, pirates, and the Empire. That all sounds as far from cosy as you can get, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Yet I will stand by my position that Star Wars Outlaws is also a cosy game at its heart. The term cosy game will probably bring images to mind of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, where you can live the life of a farmer or spend time decorating your home and just hanging out with friends without a care in the world. Star Wars Outlaws doesn’t let you become a moisture farmer on Tatooine or set up a small shop on Toshara, but it does provide other ways to be cosy.</p>


<p>First and foremost is treasure hunting. Getting on Kay’s speeder and just striking out into the worlds to explore places that are off the beaten path to discover new secrets is one of the best things to do in Star Wars Outlaws. Sure, some treasure is guarded and will require sneaking around or getting into a firefight, but there are many more caches that just require a bit of tracking, climbing, and puzzle solving to get the goods. It is these moments when it is just Kay and Nix working together to find treasure which epitomise cosiness to me. There is no stress, you can take your time searching for the treasure, and there is no pressure to get it done. Sure, there is a bigger job out there to complete, yet these times are islands of calm. Couple that with jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva and you just get this sense of blissful freedom.</p>


<p>The second cost corner of Star Wars Outlaws is with its galaxy of food. Cooking and enjoying food is one of my favourite things to do, so having specific street foods to try on each planet feels like another cosy thing to do to. Walking up to a food stall, getting the food, and even playing the minigame as Kay and Nix indulge in the meal. Those moments between the two capture how joyful eating a good meal can be, and the companionship it can provide. This part of Star Wars Outlaws has clearly been designed around cosiness while rewarding that cosy moment with rewards. It is the best of both wrapped in warmth.</p>
<p>Third is jumping on the speeder and riding across desert of Tatooine or the open water of Akiva where you just get this sense of calm and freedom. The same applies to flying through space on the Trailblazer, again treasure hunting. Yes, you can get waylaid by pirates or bandits now and again while riding or flying about, but when that isn’t happening and you are just moving with no real destination in mind also has an element of cosiness to it.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws may not be a typical cosy game, but I am coming up to 50 hours in the game and I have found it to be one of best ways to relax after a busy day. I certainly have some complaints about other parts of the experience, but they don’t all detract from those moments of calm and cosiness that Star Wars Outlaws can offer.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/879221/logitech-gpro-x2-superstrike-gaming-mouse-pc-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1436644</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Enthusiast gaming keyboard tech has made the jump to gaming mice — well, to one gaming mouse so far. The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flogitech-pro-x2-superstrike-lightspeed-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse-with-customizable-click-haptics-for-pc-mac-laptop-wireless-white%2FJ7H7ZYL6CY%2Fsku%2F6667851" rel="sponsored">$179.99 Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike</a> is the first to feature analog sensors that use induction to register clicks faster than microswitches used in many mice.</p><p>Those sensors allow for a host of cool features beyond just lower latency. There’s a rapid trigger setting, popularized by Hall effect keyboards, that lets them quickly reset after being pressed to receive another input. The sensors in this mouse also let you customize how much you need to press each of the main buttons to send an input, requiring almost no pressure at all, a click that requires more effort (great if you’ve got an itchy trigger finger), or something in between.</p><p>One of the Superstrike’s most interesting changes is that it has haptics in place of switches under its buttons. They simulate the sound and feel of a click with surprising accuracy, and unlike tapping on an unmoving MacBook trackpad, the mouse’s main buttons move and bounce back up as you might expect them to. If their default click sensation isn’t doing it for you, you can make it more intense (at the expense of battery life), or remove it altogether for silent operation (at the expense of, well, knowing when you’ve clicked at all).</p><p>I’ve felt jaded over the years by numerous features introduced in gaming mice that claim to be more beneficial in competitive games than they feel in real-life use (shrinking weights, 8,000Hz polling rate, optical sensors did nothing for me, personally). But the Superstrike feels like the start of a big change in gaming mice, and Logitech got a lot right here, even though its design isn’t radically different from its past models.</p><p>If you’re wondering whether this mouse is for you, let me put it this way: The Superstrike, with its analog sensors and adjustable actuation distances, is far easier to recommend than a Hall effect gaming keyboard that offers the same features. The difference comes down to Logitech’s haptics; they feel like the real thing, but you can tweak the feel if you’d like to. On the other hand, Hall effect switches in keyboards have a certain feel — quiet, almost no resistance — and that can’t be changed.</p><p>I’ve been using the Superstrike for a few days for my work at <em>The Verge</em> and to play some games. Unsurprisingly, flexing its haptics and analog sensors in Google Chrome isn’t that exciting. They were fun features to tweak in <em>Deadlock</em>, however. With many, many button presses required to defeat creeps and player enemies — not to mention frequently clicking around in menus to buy upgrades — lowering both the haptics intensity and the actuation distance for the left mouse button felt right. With rapid trigger, I could more quickly get locked in to land more shots. The boost in responsiveness felt more noticeable with characters that can quickly burst automatic weapons (like Haze) than those who shoot one round of ammo at a time (like the archer Grey Talon).</p><p>I don’t envision many scenarios when I’d want to increase the actuation distance of the buttons. Although, it seems handy in extraction shooters, where your success can come down to keeping quiet at the right times. I’m prone to misfiring in games due to being nervous about making a play, so requiring more effort to click could aid me there. Regardless, it’s nice to have this flexibility afforded by the analog sensors.</p><p>I’ve watched and read a lot of coverage regarding the Superstrike since it launched, and my favorite was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYp2Yo-7bTg">Dave2D’s video</a> in which he comes to the conclusion that its lower latency and faster sensors de-aged his gaming chops, making him feel like he was in his prime again. As we age, our response time generally worsens, which explains why there are many, many young people in their teens and 20s who play games professionally, but not many who are older than that. The Superstrike is, unsurprisingly, proving to be popular with younger pros, like esports player Yigox, who <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-mice/haptic-click-sceptics-take-heed-the-logitech-superstrike-has-already-got-a-guinness-world-record/">recently used the mouse to win a Guinness World Record</a> for most clicks in a minute at 760.</p><p>The Superstrike is not a magical youth serum for gamers. It doesn’t help you with aiming or provide unfair shortcuts to success. But its features aren’t gimmicks. Assuming you’re putting in the practice to get better at games, Logitech’s new mouse with its faster, more customizable clicks might help you hang with the competition a little longer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/879221/logitech-gpro-x2-superstrike-gaming-mouse-pc-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-rose-teaser-countdown">While the website had spurred all kinds of theories</a> – for instance, taking the capital letters from the word salad on the site "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd" is an anagram of "Cronos", leading some to speculate that this was a teaser for DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> – Bloober has marked the tenth anniversary of the horror game with confirmation of a third instalment.</p>

<p>There was no gameplay to showcase, I'm afraid, but we were treated to a strange live-action teaser, embedded above, in which we were told "the door won't stay closed". Unfortunately, there's no other information, either, such as a release date.</p>
<p>Though entitled Layers of Fear 3, this is actually the fourth Layers of Fear game, as the original game was remade for current-gen systems in 2023.</p><figure>

<p>Bloober's been on a good run. It's already released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of Layers of Fear called Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition, and is also working on Silent Hill 1 Remake and Project M, a horror game published by Broken Mirror Games exclusively on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>While I loved the settings and imagery, I ultimately didn't get on with the previous sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear-2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, labelling it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-2-eagerly-anticipated-horror-sequel-falls-flat">a slick psychological horror plagued by poor pacing and infuriating instakills</a> when I reviewed it back in 2019. I similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blair-witch-review-lumpy-horror-that-has-its-fair-share-of-scares">struggled with Blair Witch</a>, and though I enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-medium-review">The Medium's aesthetics and mysterious storyline</a>, its finale contains some, uh, troubling narrative choices. I have, however, very much enjoyed the team's later output, including Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">which received a rare 5/5 from me,</a> and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/balatro-meets-luck-be-a-landlord-in-chaotic-cooking-roguelike-that-cant-stop-winning-new-fans-2000668754</link>
            <guid>1436611</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Pick ingredients off a conveyor belt. Drag them around a plate. Try to unlock point combos and hope your incredible, edible abominations pass muster with an idiosyncratic cast of anthropomorphic guests. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/omelet-you-cook"><em>Omelet You Cook</em></a> is a tight, simple, rewarding roguelike with more than enough personality and flare to earn a seat at the table. The only thing I want to do after I lose is fire up the grill all over again.</p> <p><em>Omelet You Cook</em> was really neat when it hit Steam Early Access in early 2025. It’s even cooler now after it’s launched in 1.0. It’s a cooking roguelike in which you select ingredients and get awarded points based on how they’re arranged on top of an omelet according to an ever more intricate cascade of scoring rules. The spatial strategizing and arrangement synergies are where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/luck-be-a-landlord-boycott-bds-xbox-israel-palenstine-indie-dev-2000654628"><em>Luck Be a Landlord</em></a> flavor comes in. Points that blaze more intensely the better you do and an in-game economy for purchasing items that bestow special perks is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a> feel comes into play.</p>

 <p>But like the best games in this RNG triage, min-maxing roguelike genre, <em>Omelet You Cook</em> exists as something more than the sum of its parts that can’t simply be reduced to its obvious inspirations. There are elements of cozy sims and chillout puzzle games here, with unique and finicky patrons reminiscent of <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers, each with different dietary restrictions and preferences. The emphasis on how food is positioned and empty space is managed reminds me a bit of the calming fiddliness of <em>A Little to the Left</em>.</p>  <p>This is the part where I tell you that if you tried <em>Omelet You Cook </em>last summer and liked it then, there’s a whole lot more to love now. Nearly two dozen updates and seven months later, February’s 1.0 update (released early <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/">to get ahead of <em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>) includes a bunch of different modes as well as the option to do the whole game turn-based if the conveyor belt continually moving was getting too stressful. There’s a Black Apron difficulty and a final showdown with Principal Clucker himself, the chicken that roasts your chef skills every time you fail.</p>

 <p>While the combo chaos is great for math nerds and the absurd recipes are fun and silly, I think <em>Omelet You Cook</em>‘s greatest strength is its quirky animal characters and light but satisfying conversational bits. There’s a generous spirit that comes through in the hospitality work and sense of community within the game, that games like <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> and <em>Balatro</em> don’t have. It’s slight but touching, with shades of <em>Donut County</em>. The music is delightful. The visuals are splendid. Every screen and object buzzes with vibrant energy.</p>

 <p>It took over 500 Steam reviews for <em>Omelet You Cook</em> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cooking-roguelike-game-omelet-you-cook-has-its-perfect-steam-review-record-ruined-by-contrarian-player">get its first negative one</a>, and that was just somebody being a dick. Play it and you’ll instantly understand why.</p>

Human developers painstakingly work to make sure the worlds their games can create are engaging to explore and filled with things to do, and at their best, these types of games can be replayable for years because of how the environments and experiences can feel novel every single time you play.</p><p>But just as other creative industries are pushing back against an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/864951/human-artistry-campaign-ai-licensing-artists">AI slop future</a>, generative AI is coming for video games, too. Though it may never catch up with the best of what humans can make now.</p><div><p id="how-its-going"><h2>How it’s going</h2></p></div><div><p>Generative AI in video games has become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848368/gen-ai-video-games-2025">a lightning rod</a>, with gamers getting <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/gamers-are-extremely-mad-about-ai.html">mad about in-game slop</a> and half of developers thinking that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey">generative AI is bad for the industry</a>.</p></div><div><p>Big video game companies are jumping into the murky waters of AI anyway. <em>PUBG</em> maker Krafton is turning into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">an “AI First” game company</a>, EA is partnering with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">Stability AI for “transformative” game-making tools</a>, and Ubisoft, as part of a major reorganization, is <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">promising that</a> it would be making “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.” The CEO of Nexon, which owns the company that made last year’s mega-hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>, put it <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">perhaps the most ominously</a>: “I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">Some indie developers disagree</a>.)</p></div><p>The bigger game companies often pitch their commitments as a way to streamline and assist with game development, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009903/the-cost-of-aaa-development-is-too-damn-high">getting increasingly expensive</a>. But adoption of generative AI tools is a potential threat to jobs in an industry already infamous for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">waves</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">of</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">layoffs</a>.</p><p>Last month, Google launched Project Genie, an “early research prototype” that lets users generate sandbox worlds using text or image prompts that they can explore for 60 seconds. Right now, the tool is only available in the US to people who subscribe to Google’s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan.</p><p>Project Genie is powered by Google’s Genie 3 AI world model, which the company <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/">pitches as</a> a “key stepping stone on the path to AGI” that can enable “AI agents capable of reasoning, problem solving, and real-world actions,” and Google says the model’s potential uses go “well beyond gaming.” But it got a lot of attention in the industry: It was the first real indication of how generative AI tools could be used for video game development, just as tools like DALL-E and OpenAI’s Sora showed what might be possible with AI-generated images and video.</p><p>In my testing, Project Genie was barely able to generate even remotely interesting experiences. The “worlds” don’t let users do much except wander around using arrow keys. When the 60 seconds are over, you can’t do anything with what you generated except download a recording of what you did, meaning you also can’t plug in what you generated into a traditional video game engine.</p><p>Sure, Project Genie did let me generate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on">terrible unauthorized Nintendo knockoffs</a> (seemingly based off of the online videos Genie 3 is trained on), which raised a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23444685/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data">familiar concerns</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/876478/a-new-bill-could-force-tech-companies-to-report-using-copyrighted-content-for-ai-training">about copyright and AI tools</a>. But they weren’t even in the same universe of quality as the worlds in a handcrafted Nintendo game. The worlds were silent, the physics were sloppy, and the environments felt rudimentary.</p><p>The day after Project Genie’s announcement, stock prices of some of the biggest video game companies, including Take-Two, Roblox, and Unity, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/871348/google-project-genie-take-two-roblox-unity">took a dip</a>. That resulted in a little damage control. Take-Two president Karl Slatoff, for example, pushed back strongly on Genie in an earnings call a few days later, arguing that Genie isn’t a threat to traditional games yet. “Genie is not a game engine,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873527/take-twos-president-says-tools-like-project-genie-dont-replace-the-creative-process">he said</a>, noting that technology like it “certainly doesn’t replace the creative process,” and that, to him, the tool looks more like “procedurally generated interactive video at this point.” (The stock prices ticked back up in the days after.)</p><div><p id="what-happens-next"><h2>What happens next</h2></p></div><p>Google will almost certainly continue improving its Genie world models and tools to generate interactive experiences. It’s unclear if it will want to improve the experiences as games or if it will instead focus on finding ways for Genie to assist with its aspirational march toward AGI.</p><p>However, other leaders of AI companies are already pushing for interactive AI experiences. xAI’s Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016876797682467277/">recently claimed</a> that “real-time” and “high-quality” video games that are “customized to the individual” will be available “next year,” and in December, he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2002557568405942724">said that</a> building an “AI gaming studio” is a “major project” for xAI. (Like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tesla/654253/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-earnings-promise-fantasy">many of Musk’s claims</a>, take his predictions and timelines with a grain of salt.) Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who is now pushing AI as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869882/mark-zuckerberg-meta-earnings-q4-2025">new social media</a> after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861295/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-shift-to-wearables">cut jobs in its metaverse group</a>, envisions a future where people create a game from a prompt and share it to people in their feeds. Even Roblox, a gaming company, is pitching how creators will be able to use AI world models and prompts to generate and change in-game worlds in real time, something that it calls <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873777/roblox-ai-world-models-real-time-dreaming-4d-creation-tools">“real-time dreaming.”</a></p><p>But even in the most ambitious view where AI technology is feasibly able to generate worlds that are as responsive and interesting to explore as a video game that runs locally on a home console, PC, or your smartphone, there’s a lot more that goes into making a video game than just creating a world. The best games have engaging gameplay, include interesting things to do, and feature original art, sound, writing, and characters. And it takes human developers sometimes years to make sure all of the elements work together just right.</p><p>AI technology isn’t yet ready to generate games, and whoever thinks it might be is fooling themselves. But AI-generated video is still bad, and it was still used to make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/875886/super-bowl-2026-ai-generated-ads-were-terrible">a bunch of bad ads for the Super Bowl</a>, so tech companies are probably still going to put a lot of effort toward games made with generative AI. In an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/865219/ubisoft-reorganization-ea-playstation-big-games">already unstable industry</a>, even the idea that AI tools could rival what humans can make might have massive ramifications down the line.</p><p>But the complexity of games is different from AI video, which has improved considerably in a short period of time but has fewer variables to account for. AI game-making tools will almost certainly improve, but the results might never close the gap from what humans can make.</p><div><p id="by-the-way"><h2>By the way</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>In <a href="https://x.com/MBromberg/status/2017275495696540149?s=20">a long X post</a>, Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg argues that world models aren’t a risk, but a “powerful accelerator.”</span></li><li><span>While the video game industry probably shouldn’t feel threatened by AI world models just yet, generative AI tools will continue to be controversial in game development.

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout: The New West Reveal Trailer Posted With a Promise to Uncover ‘The Original Fallout 3’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-the-new-west-reveal-trailer-published/</link>
            <guid>1436596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311">Fallout</a> is a bustling realm that’s as much made up of the original projects by the developers as it is fan-made projects pieced together by those enthralled by the post-apocalyptic universe that emerged in the late 1990s. The latest entry into that world, Fallout: The New West, is no different, but it’s one of the more ambitious concepts to surface in recent years.</p>



<p>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made project that aims to remake the cancelled Fallout: Van Buren, which many die-hard fans have always dubbed ‘the original Fallout 3’. It’s what might have been had the original team not hit a patch of financial distress and shifted focus away from the series, ultimately selling the label to Bethesda Game Studios.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-the-new-west-revives-what-might-have-been">Fallout: The New West Revives What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Van Buren was canned in 2003 after months of development at Black Isle Studios. It would have been the third major release in the series, bearing the name ‘Fallout 3’ and taking players to the American southwest, around Colorado. Coincidentally, that’s where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-fallout-set-colorado-season-two-explained/" id="174234">the next season</a> of the Fallout television show is headed.</p>



<p>It was never to be, and in 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> released Fallout 3, a monumental overhaul to the series and a real risk-taker of a game, after acquiring the licenses from Interplay and Black Isle.</p>



<p>Now, a group of dedicated modders is bringing Van Buren back to life with Fallout: The New West. It’s a complete conversion mod that promises to transform Fallout: New Vegas, telling the ‘same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren.’ On the website for Fallout: The New West, the game’s narrative was outlined, and by all accounts, it’s an ambitious stab at a near-forgotten game.</p>



<p>Days ago, The United West Team, the group assembling The New West, posted the first teaser trailer for the mod:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: The New West Reveal Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY5X0G_05h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the trailer had garnered more than 100,000 views and hundreds of positive comments. One user wrote, <em>‘For a moment, I thought this was from Bethesda and went, ‘Oh, so they were actually cooking.’ As always, it’s the community that keeps Fallout alive.’</em></p>



<p>Fallout: The New West actually surfaced around five years ago. In May 2021, the team at The United West announced plans to piece the mod together, but back then, it was dubbed Fallout Revelation Blue. Back then, it was noted that Fallout: The New West <strong>would not </strong>treat New Vegas as canonical.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, and that’s that Bethesda’s Todd Howard probably won’t play this mod either, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/" id="167864">effectively snubbing Fallout: London</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="c8637a648abe7"><a title="Escape from Ever After" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8637a648abe7/escape-from-ever-after.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Hypetrain Digital</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a> is the heir apparent to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> throne. Sleepy Castle Studio released it on 23rd January to all major platforms with a simple promise – deliver Paper Mario fans the game they’ve been clamouring for ever since Nintendo chose to shift the series away from its RPG roots.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-paper-mario-likes-on-switch-games-to-play-if-you-miss-old-school-paper-mario">Other games have tried</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/born_of_bread">Born of Bread</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bug_fables_the_everlasting_sapling">Bug Fables</a> come to mind as two examples that accomplish some of their goals, but overall come down as lukewarm clones of the nostalgic blast of joy that TTYD delivers.</p>
<p>The Thousand-Year Door was the second instalment in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_the_complete_history_of_paper_mario">Paper Mario series</a>, and it’s the game that fans still hold up as the pinnacle. Originally released as a GameCube exclusive on 11th October 2004, it remained unrivalled in its humorous joy, graphical whimsy, and surprisingly elegant mechanical depth for well over 20 years…until Escape from Ever After came on the scene.</p>

<p>You play as Flynt Buckler, a valiant knight from a children’s fantasy story who is heading out for another face-off against his sworn rival, Tinder the Dragon. However, when Flynt reaches the dragon’s castle, he is met with the corporate headquarters of his story’s “new owners.”</p>
<p>A jovial middle manager named Mr. Moon offers Flynt a job at the corporation, but he declines and is thrown in jail where he meets Tinder, who has been shrunken down to size by Ever After Incorporated’s advanced technology. From there, knight and dragon set out on a journey to take down the company from the inside.</p>
<h2><strong>Trading Paper Punches: Round 1</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="7197e02fa318e"><a title="Escape from Ever After" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7197e02fa318e/escape-from-ever-after.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Jonny Malks / Hypetrain Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s time to pit these two great games against one another. Since The Thousand-Year Door has nearly double the chapters of Escape from Ever After, I’m going to break up the two games into thematic sequences and discuss them in turn. I’ll start with the prologues and beginning chunks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: This section contains plot points and spoilers for both games. If you haven't yet, go play them first!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Thousand-Year Door has an iconic opening, with Mario waking up in a first-person cutscene on a ship bound for Rogueport, a sordid town full of salty scoundrels. Throughout the prologue, we’re introduced to the game's off-kilter world and lore, including the first of Paper Luigi’s many long-winded anecdotes. This is but one example of TTYD’s distinctly weird and wonderful tone.</p>
<p>From there, Mario embarks on the first of his adventures to face a dragon in a castle. This is the exact type of fairytale trope that Escape from Ever After plays with in its dynamic between Flynt and Tinder.</p>

<p>Paper Mario’s second chapter, The Great Boggly Tree, is a mystical exploration of a puzzle-filled tree of life. There are some herding-based head scratchers included here that I think mar the flow of the game to a degree. Still, the chapter ends with an introduction to Madame Flurrie, TTYD’s most eccentric companion, ending the game’s first chunk on a high note and delivering a haymaker to its spiritual sequel right out of the starting gates.</p>
<p>Escape from Ever After, for its part, starts off strong with Flynt’s disorienting orientation to the capitalist tentacles of Ever After Inc. Flynt and Tinder's dialogue strikes a nice balance between snarky banter and efficient tutorial.</p>

<p>Then, they embark on their first adventure in the Three Little Pigs storybook, a level that sets the tone for the game as one that mixes humour with commentary about the role art has to play in a society built on capitalist moneymongering.</p>
<p>In spite of the opening’s clever puzzles, funny dialogue, and competent boss fight, it can’t quite hold a candle to the plumber’s barrage of clever hubworld introduction and iconic companions. Mario takes round one.</p>
<h2><strong>Spooky Town Tango: Round 2</strong></h2>
<p>The Thousand-Year Door’s middle section includes the most iconic stage in the game: Glitzville, home of the Glitz Pit, which is essentially the Mario-fied version of the WWE.</p>
<p>The gameplay becomes almost roguelite, with increasingly difficult battles broken up by opportunities to rest and re-spec. The story and humour in this section are spot-on and entirely emblematic of the reasons this particular Paper Mario is beloved across fan communities.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fd2f5496a0884"><a title="Paper Mario TTYD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd2f5496a0884/paper-mario-ttyd.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, Mario and friends travel to Twilight Town to retrieve a Crystal Star from Creepy Steeple, a place where every time the bell at the top of the steeple rings, one of the people in town transforms into a pig. Despite the spooky yet comic themes of this world being right up my alley, the Twilight Town chapter reads to me as one of the weaker entries in the game. The combat feels similar to the chapters before it, and the overall environmental gameplay doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from other chapters.</p>
<p>The game brings back the heat in its following quest for the pirate lair after the Creepy Steeple mystery is solved, and its dramatic irony is pumped up yet again by Lord Crump disguising himself and sailing along with Mario for this section. It would be a near-perfect howitzer if not for the drag in its spooky tale.</p>
<p>Escape from Ever After punches back in a big way by reaching tonal perfection in a horror story of its own.</p>

<p>First, Flynt and his band infiltrate the forbidden section of the castle library to find their next storybook to travel to. It’s called The Shadow Over Innsbeak, a mash-up of classic Lovecraftian monsters, Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and…birds?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this strange concoction leads to unmatched weirdness, imaginative turns, and outright hilarity. All that needs to be said is that Sherlock Holmes <em>himself</em> ends up falling in love with Cthulhu. I’ve never been more grateful for the public domain in my entire life.</p>
<p>Escape from Ever After follows this unlikely love story up with a very solid pirate arc. One that counterpunches Paper Mario blow for blow, cementing an undeniable conclusion for this round: Escape from Ever After emerges victorious!</p>
<h2><strong>Final Fight: Round 3</strong></h2>
<p>That brings us to our final round, with the two games trading strikes like prize fighters.</p>
<figure data-uuid="493352635d1bf"><a title="Paper Mario TTYD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/493352635d1bf/paper-mario-ttyd.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Thousand-Year Door brings its band of heroes to a ritzy town. Then to a frosty outpost full of well-rendered Bob-ombs, each with their own stories to tell. Then to…the moon?! And it’s all complete with playable Peach scenes and twists that will bring a smile to even the most surly trope-hunters.</p>
<p>For its part, Escape from Ever After races through its finale, with a charming sci-fi romp on a snowy, Hoth-adjacent planet before the characters have to dip into Mr. Moon’s storybook for a confrontation with their middle manager. The game’s writing absolutely shines at this juncture, propelling the characters toward their confrontation with Ever After Inc.’s CEO in the “Real World.”</p>
<p>Escape from Ever After is a special game, made all the more impressive by sticking the landing required by its ending. It has a lot to say about art, authorship, love, and the power of stories.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d8af2b4ae4f96"><a title="Escape from Ever After" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8af2b4ae4f96/escape-from-ever-after.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Jonny Malks / Hypetrain Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, The Thousand-Year Door is a classic for a reason. My love of the grizzled Admiral Bobbery and the charmingly forward <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-paper-marios-ms-mowz-taught-me-how-to-appreciate-and-steal-the-little-things">Ms. Mowz</a> is the reason why the original edges out Escape from Ever After in this final round. Yes, we can conclusively raise the fist of the reigning champion, yet again. All hail The Thousand Year Door, the undefeated winner.</p>
<h2><strong>Finally, A Worthy Heir</strong></h2>
<p>Still, the fact that Escape from Ever After ranks alongside the undisputed champion is a <em>huge</em> accomplishment.</p>
<p>The reason this new game gets the job done where similar attempts have failed is in its writing and characterisation. Tinder, Wolfgang, Eva, and Patches are each zany, funny, and heartfelt in turns, and – though they aren’t quite as batty as TTYD's cast of weirdos – they have even more to say about the “Real World” that they’re questing for. These companions’ interactions with Flynt and the characters they meet along the way have given me hope in a new year that hasn’t had a whole lot of good in it to date.</p>

<p>This is Escape from Ever After’s magic trick. The writing, alongside its tight combat and fine-tuned environmental puzzles, strikes that elusive balance that made The Thousand-Year Door a classic. Great for kids and adults alike. Taking itself just seriously enough to drive its message home. Full of laughter but still with so very much to say.</p>
<p>From start to finish, Escape from Ever After is a love letter to the idea that good games made with care still have a place in our broken world. It strives to convince us that beauty, art, and humour can be a balm to the darkness we see all around us. It tells us that, even though all stories are bound to come to an end, there is so much value in finding joy in what we love and the folks we choose to spend our time with. And if that’s not a thesis for why I play games in the first place, then I don’t know what is.</p>

We see a painting of a woman, presumably the “sick rose,” and another painting of what looks like a humanoid figure, potentially the same woman, amid a sickness with their mouth sewn shut. A ghostly figure moves past this painting before the painting of the woman falls to the ground. The man waves this away as being the responsibility of his “little friend” who “tries to help” but hasn’t quite got the hang of the afterlife. The teaser ends with the man issuing a Valentine’s Day warning to the audience before turning over a sand timer. The Layers of Fear 3 tagline reads: “Some Things Never Leave The Walls. They Only Learn To Wait.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s pretty much all we have for now on Layers of Fear 3, which sits alongside the Silent Hill remake Bloober Team also has in the works. There’s also a number of smaller games from its subsidiary, Broken Mirror Games, which include a mysterious Switch exclusive codenamed Project M. This all follows what has been a high-profile period for the Polish studio, which has enjoyed success with the Silent Hill 2 remake for Konami, as well as self-published releases including Cronos: The New Dawn and The Medium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It's time for this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-super-bomberman-2-snes">Last time</a>, it was a one-on-one match-up for the SNES' <strong>Super Bomberman 2</strong> to celebrate its arrival in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, and it was a pretty tight contest. The Japanese cover <em>just</em> came out on top, in the end, winning 56% of the vote and leaving the Western variant with the remaining 44%.</p>
<p>This week, with another collection on our minds, we're taking a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> for the Game Boy Color. While it was a mighty hop, skip, and jump away from its PlayStation counterpart, we have some fond memories of this 2000 platformer. You just know that we'll be diving into it all over again when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> lands on Switch this week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6jhyvxp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There are three covers to choose between this week, so let's check 'em out.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:197441,24167 @ 1771167989 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="94b458740de75"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94b458740de75/rayman-gbc-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American cover is a pretty standard Rayman affair. Our limbless hero takes centre stage, swinging through a green backdrop on a vine. It's simple and to the point, but it's difficult to knock.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6ee5fa0bc9c83"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ee5fa0bc9c83/rayman-gbc-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design dares ask the question, 'What if the North American cover was... red?' The result is, well, redder.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="76c722c2c75bf"><a title="Rayman (GBC) - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/76c722c2c75bf/rayman-gbc-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/8321-rayman">Ubisoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now here's something different. The singular Rayman is here replaced by a whopping <em>five Raymans</em> (Raymen?), each in a different pose. The backdrop is a little bland, by comparison, but it's always nice to see more going on.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 Hall Effect Gaming Keyboard Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/15/corsair-vanguard-pro-96-hall-effect-gaming-keyboard-review/</link>
            <guid>1436551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Corsair has consistently put out my favorite gaming keyboards for the last several years. From the full-sized K70 to the compact powerhouse K65, whenever I need a new keyboard the answer has always been Corsair. Even while I was comfortable with what they already had on offer, though, the team at Corsair has continued to revolutionise and energise their line of competitive keyboard gear. The Vanguard Pro 96 packs in so many new features and upgrades I hadn’t ever considered needing in a keyboard, but now that I have them, I don’t see myself ever going with anything else.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the CORSAIR VANGUARD Series" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LP5C2LZtZeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if the 96% layout would be for me, at first. I got quite comfortable with how compact and minimal the 75% layout of my K65 was. With the Vanguard Pro 96, though, Corsair has struck a really nice balance that has left me more than happy. You’ve got pretty much the full range of keys you’d expect on here, but with the middle column and space between the arrow-keys and numpad stripped away, they all equally occupy space across the keyboard in a clean, compact way. What’s amazing is that alongside those keys, Corsair have managed to include a rotary volume dial, a 1.9-inch LCD screen display, and a row of 6 programmable macro keys to boot.</p>


<p>The macro keys are so smartly designed – the keyboard has sloped and curved edges instead of flat straight edges, and the macro key row is nestled alongside the left edge of the keyboard along that slope. As a result, your macro keys are easy to see and easy to tap without being too hidden away or, worse, adding the bulk of extra keys to the main layout.</p>


<p>I love the look of the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 keyboard a lot. At first, those soft raised edges of the sturdy aluminum frame betrayed the minimal design I was so used to prioritizing in my choice of keyboard. I cared less and less about that preference the more I used this keyboard, though, eventually coming around to loving how the slightly more expressive frame really draws the eye and makes the keyboard feel just a bit more premium. It matches up perfectly with the soft edges of the provided wrist-pad, too.</p>
<p>If there’s one design flaw I had to point out, though, it would be the USB-C port placement. The port is nestled underneath the middle of the keyboard, but you also need to pinch and thread your cable between two small plastic hooks to properly insert it. Once it’s there, it’s secure and neatly tucked away – but in moments where I had to unplug and replug the USB-C, it definitely caused a bit of an annoyance.</p>
<p>I’m blown away by how good the MGX magnetic switches and double-shot PBT keycaps feel on this keyboard. It’s my first experience with a hall effect keyboard, as I’ve only engaged with hall effect technology in the context of game console controllers. There’s a soft yet sturdy clack to each stroke of the key, and that spacebar press is full of satisfying weight and emphasis each time I click it. The keys never betray my typing speed or heavy hand, and they’re plenty reliable in high-pressure games of Apex Legends or Arc Raiders.</p>

<p>The big thrill with magnetic switch technology is that you’re able to customise them to really get the feel and sensitivity you need. The switches on the Vanguard Pro 96 have a 4.0mm travel distance, but you can adjust them in the Corsair software to hit anywhere from 4.0mm to 0.1mm.</p>
<p>Like some of their other new peripherals, the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 is only customizable via a new lightweight web portal – no more iCue software download required. It’s a relief to be able to get a bit of software bloat removed from my PC, and once you’re in that web portal, you’ve got just as many exhaustive customisation options as you would have expected from the download software. The keyboard RGB is fully customizable, of course, and your programmable macro keys can be set up here to drive anything from daily tasks to in-game macro actions. Smartly, you can even customise and save multiple layers of macro setups, swapping between them depending on what you’re up to. This is also where you can adjust the actuation and reset points for the magnetic switches individually.</p>

<p>It really is so impressive just how much is packed into the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96. Blending an almost full keyboard layout with additional macro keys, a volume dial, a display screen, and even a dedicated Stream Deck button is a lot – but to have all of that come together and still feel like it’s compactly and cleanly contained in this 96% frame is downright marvellous. In a world where so many options for gaming hardware feel like they’re conceding one feature to make room for another, there are no concessions with this keyboard. Well, besides maybe that awkward USB port placement.</p>

<p>Earn the number</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> was delayed recently, his new mission is now back on track with a <strong>27th May 2026</strong> release.</p>
<p>With the target date in his sights, IO Interactive has now treated fans of Bond to a new trailer. This video originally popped up during this week's PlayStation 'State of Play' broadcast and focuses on the story of this "re-imagined origin story" where Bond must "earn the number" in the 00 Programme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Discover a re-imagined origin story as James Bond enters the 00 Programme as a promising young recruit. Despite his occasional recklessness, Bond's intuition, charm, and skill will push him to #earnthenumber within His Majesty's Secret Service."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the action-packed trailer above, as Bond, you'll encounter plenty of friendly and not-so-friendly faces on your mission.</p>
<p>This new "thrilling espionage action-adventure game" is once again made by the developer behind the latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman</a> outing, which made its debut on the Switch 2 last June and also got a special mission featuring a 007 First Light unlock.</p>

    <p><span>Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Following <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/bloober-team-launches-remosd-neul-serorehso-ovam-ceyerd-countdown-website">a countdown</a> that began on New Year’s Eve 2025, <a title="Companies > Bloober Team [118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear 3" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-3">Layers of Fear 3</a></em> for unspecified platforms. A release date was not announced. The reveal comes 10 years after the release of the original <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear (2023) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-2023">Layers of Fear</a></em> in 2016. <span id="more-1026895"></span></p><p>“Good evening and welcome to the <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary showcase,” Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said during today’s <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event. “Some of you have been with us for a very long time. Others arrived later by accident, curiosity, or through a friend’s recommendation. But if you are here, it’s because at some point the story grabbed you and wouldn’t let go. For Bloober Team, <em>Layers of Fear</em> isn’t just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be—what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that <em>Layers of Fear</em> is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.”</p><p>Bloober Team creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart added, “<em>Layers of Fear</em> was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing <a title="Genres > Horror [820 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> into a deeply human experience. When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. <em>Layers of Fear</em> is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself.”</p><p>Babieno added, “There is a certain kind of horror that doesn’t come from what you see. It comes from what you feel and what you can’t stop feeling. For us, that’s always been the core of <em>Layers of Fear</em>. And nothing captures it better than the game’s haunting soundtrack. Its delicate melodies reveal the emotional heart of Layers of Fear, one colored by regret, love, and memory. We are excited to finally be able to share it with you.”</p><p>Bloober Team also announced plans to release a physical edition of the <em>Layers of Fear</em> soundtrack, as well as <em>Layers of Fear</em>-inspired books written by Polish authors and distributed by Foksal. The first book will be written by Marta Bijan and launch in late 2026.</p><p>Watch the <em>Layers of Fear 3</em> teaser trailer and <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event below.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloober-team/" id="1451">Bloober Team</a> officially reveals Layers of Fear 3, the next chapter in its psychological horror series.</p>



<p>Bloober Team previously teased a countdown clock that would expire on Valentine’s Day, featuring audio featuring a quote from The Sick Rose and a poem by William Blake.</p>



<p>The countdown clock was tied to the franchise’s 10th anniversary. It led to the reveal of Layers of Fear 3. The game’s tagline uses the same line from that poem heard in the audio, “Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Six Invitational 2026 comes to a head tomorrow in Paris, and it’s all down to just two teams: FaZe Clan and Team Secret. Following an intense tournament, the grand finalists are lined up and raring to go, but only one will walk out of the stadium with $1 million and the coveted Six Invitational trophy.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most valuable grand finals in esports, as even the second-place team takes a $450,000 check home. Let’s jump into everything you need to know about the Six Invitational 2026 grand final.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-predictions-faze-clan-vs-team-secret">Six Invitational 2026 Predictions: FaZe Clan vs. Team Secret</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is a tough one to call at this point. Even though only <strong>two teams remain</strong>, they’re very evenly matched as we run into the grand final. The group stage yielded similar results for both squads, with Team Secret having the edge, but FaZe Clan shone a little brighter during the playoffs.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that it’s FaZe Clan’s <strong>third </strong>grand final in a row at the Six Invitational, which is impressive by itself. Last year, the organization lifted the trophy in Boston after wiping Team BDS in the grand final, making up for a tough second-place finish on home turf in 2024.</p>



<p>Team Secret bloomed <strong>heavily </strong>last year, securing the win at the Esports World Cup, but FaZe Clan remains the favourite to lift the hammer this year in Paris. The community is behind FaZe Clan, but it’s <strong>close</strong>, and both teams are playing on neutral ground.</p>



<p>If you want to tune in, the grand final of the Six Invitational 2026 will start at 17:00 GMT, and you can expect some huge news from Ubisoft before it lands.</p>







<p>What are you thinking? Will we see an underdog upset from Team Secret, or will FaZe Clan go back-to-back at the Six Invitational? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quests in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> often don't ask you to complete complicated tasks in your runs <strong>Topside</strong>. They're usually just asking you to bring a specific item back, or some just want you to look around in a specific area. But the quests, specifically the ones you get as you unlock new maps, are doing more than just asking you to bring something back.</p>



<p>They're helping you acclimate to the new map, and teaching you about its more important areas. That's exactly what the '<strong>A First Foothold</strong>' quest is doing when you first unlock the<strong> Blue Gate</strong> map. Speranza's gadgets and grenades expert, <strong>Apollo</strong>, asks you to visit several key spots on the map. But with no waypoints and only small descriptions of where to go, finding each point might prove a shade challenging.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will help you run through the 'A First Foothold' quest, showing you where to go so you can start raiding the Blue Gate with ease.</p>

<p>The 'A First Foothold' quest tasks you with visiting four spots on the map. You have to find an observation deck near the Ridgeline on the perimeter of the map, a communications terminal near the Olive Grove, reach satellite dishes on the roof of a church north of the Data Vault, and fix the roof plates of a Raider structure near Trapper's Glade.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, visiting each of these locations in one visit Topside will mean that you're trying to run around the entire map in one session, and doing so while avoiding ARC and other players successfully gets more difficult the longer you stay Topside, especially as more and more ARC are sent to the area.</p>



<p>That's why, depending on where you're dropped, you should try to visit at least two of the locations in one run. That's more than possible to do without taking the risk that you won't make it back to Speranza.</p>



<p>If you do want to risk it, then make sure to bring a hatch key with you, so you can still find your way back home once you've completed every task.</p>

<p>A quick way to know where to find the observation deck near the Ridgeline is to look at the map and place your waypoint over the 'ne' in the word 'Ridgeline' on the east side of the map. If you stick to the perimeter of the map, you should have an easy stroll to complete one of the four objectives.</p>

<p>Apollo's advice for where to find the comms terminal is unfortunately quite confusing. I'm sure someone at Embark feels like its location is 'near' the Olive Grove, but a better suggestion would be to say it is between the Highway Collapse and the Olive Grove. It's just about an equal distance between the two.</p>

<p>Like the observation deck near the Ridgeline, getting to the satellite dishes on the roof of the church will send you to the edges of the map. This time it'll be the northeast edge, right in between Pilgrim's Peak and the Village.</p>



<p>Walk around to the back side of the church, and you should be able to jump onto the roof to get to the satellite. There's also a structure at the front of the church that can get you up there if you're nimble enough.</p>

<p>The Raider structure in the Trapper's Glade is one objective you could probably go alongside hitting the comms terminal in between the Highway Collapse and the Olive Grove, since they are technically close enough. Just remember <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">not to lose track of time</a>, which can easily happen if you're trying to run across the map and do all of these in one round.</p>



<p>You'll find the structure just south of the 'Trapper's Glade' text on the map. Just climb to the roof and you'll be prompted to nail it down.</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>When you make it back to Speranza after completing these tasks, Apollo will grant you three <strong>Shrapnel Grenades,</strong> three <strong>Snap Blast Grenades</strong>, and three <strong>Heavy Fuze Grenades</strong>.</p>
