<p>Every year, the best VALORANT team at the world is crowned at VALORANT Champions, which serves as the world championship for Riot Games’ agent-filled tactical shooter. Over time, the event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has drawn larger audiences as the game expands its global reach</a>, and that reach is exemplified in all the different regions that have claimed the trophy at VALORANT Champions.</p>



<p>VALORANT may have a shorter history than several other esports titles, but that just makes the hall of Champions winners that much more exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-champions-winners-in-order">All VALORANT Champions Winners, In Order</h2>



<p>There have been four VALORANT Champions winners so far, beginning with the inaugural tournament in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-acend-2021">Acend – 2021</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Jianhua Chen for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Acend’s story has somewhat of a sad ending, as the organization didn’t acquire partnership in the VCT international leagues, and was <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to close its doors</a> in 2024 due to unsustainability. But the organization and its players still hold the distinction of being the first ever VALORANT Champions winners, defeating a Gambit team that had dominated the scene for virtually the entire year in a thrilling five-map series in the grand finals.</p>



<ul>
<li>Santeri “BONECOLD” Sassi</li>



<li>Mehmet “cNed” İpek</li>



<li>Vladyslav “Kiles” Shvets</li>



<li>Patryk “starxo” Kopczyński</li>



<li>Aleksander “zeek” Zygmunt</li>



<li>Laurynas “Nbs” Kisielius (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-loud-2022">LOUD – 2022</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Brazilian organization LOUD entered VALORANT at the start of 2022, and finished the year with a world championship. LOUD pulled the best talent from Brazil together under one electric green banner, and found a rival wearing green themselves in OpTic Gaming. The two teams faced each other six times during the 2022 season, but LOUD got the last laugh in the upper bracket final and the grand final of Champions 2023.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bryan “pANcada” Luna</li>



<li>Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi</li>



<li>Matias “Saadhak” Delipetro</li>



<li>Erick “aspas” Santos</li>



<li>Felipe “Less” Basso</li>



<li>Matheus “bzkA” Tarasconi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-evil-geniuses-2023">Evil Geniuses – 2023</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evil Geniuses’ championship run in 2023 is considered one of the miraculous runs in the history of esports. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coach Christine “potter” Chi</a> started with a roster of lowly regarded players and added a completely unknown player from an open tryout mid-season. The North American team stunned the international audience with a grand finals run at Masters Tokyo, then knocked off Champions contenders like DRX, LOUD, and finally Paper Rex to win the world championship in front of a Los Angeles home crowd.</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</li>



<li>Ethan “Ethan” Arnold</li>



<li>Alexander “jawgemo” Mor</li>



<li>Corbin “C0M” Lee</li>



<li>Max “Demon1” Mazanov</li>



<li>Christine “potter” Chi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-edward-gaming-2024">EDward Gaming – 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ expansion of the international VALORANT esports ecosystem into China couldn’t have gone any better for the region. EDward Gaming, after dominating the Chinese scene again but falling short on the international stage, finally had their moment at Champions 2024. In Seoul, EDG went undefeated in playoffs, defeating Team Heretics in an amazing grand final, cementing Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang as the top star of Chinese VALORANT.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wan “CHICHOO” Shunzhi</li>



<li>Wang “nobody” Senxu</li>



<li>Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang</li>



<li>Zhang “Smoggy” Zhao</li>



<li>Hsieh “S1Mon” Meng-hsun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun (coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>Across these four years of VALORANT, no team has accomplished the feat of winning both a Masters event and Champions. Only one player has accomplished this: Sacy, who won Champions 2022 with LOUD and Masters Madrid 2024 with Sentinels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie announced today that Destiny 2 will receive Star Wars skins and cosmetics on February 4, 2025, along with the game’s third and final Episode, Heresy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have only <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1884318035000938780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teased</a> the upcoming Destiny 2 Star Wars skins and cosmetics, and we have yet to learn what exactly will be released. Players should expect new armour ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers inspired by Star Wars. Additionally, at the launch of Heresy, three new armour ornaments (one per Guardian class) will become available. And the inspiration for these ornaments will be “the soldiers of the Galactic Empire”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-heresy-act-1">Destiny 2’s Heresy Act 1</h2>



<p>Apart from the Destiny 2 x Star Wars collaboration, the developers have released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details</a> about their third episode and final epilogue, Heresy. Guardians should expect the return of a familiar foe: the Dreadnaught. However, this time, the players will take the fight to the Dreadnaught through a new exploration and combat-based activity: The Nether.&nbsp;The Heresy Episode will consist of three Acts. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers will experiment with player modifiers in the upcoming Destiny 2 update. Once the Heresy update arrives, players will observe new modifiers “with increased health pools, no regenerating of health, low ammo drops and revive tokens, and a modification on healing in the sandbox over the course of play.” Bungie wants players to strategically build their loadouts for survivability as health pools increase and regen is stopped in the upcoming update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, according to claims, Bungie’s upcoming MOBA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is inspired by Smash Bros</a>. The development studio allegedly hired fans because they would “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work for less.</a>” What are your thoughts on Destiny 2’s Star Wars collaboration? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the aftermath of the bombs dropping in and around Appalachia, much of the wasteland is barren and rife with danger. But some settlements and tows prove relatively sane and peaceful. Helvetia is neither. It’s a strange haven. But it’s where you’ll find the annual <strong>Fasnacht Event</strong>! Here is where to find Helvetia in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76"><strong>How to Find Helvetia in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find Helvetia in Fallout 76 by venturing into <strong>The Forest region</strong>, an early-game portion of the world map, and then head south of <strong>Morgantown</strong>, along the river, and just east of <strong>Sutton</strong>. It’s a small town with a main road, a three-way intersection, and a handful of buildings, including a church and several residential abodes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, the area is relatively quiet for the post-apocalypse. It’s home to a handful of Scorched on any given day, except during Fasnacht when all hell breaks loose, and people flock to the town in droves to celebrate in strange masks and with music aplenty!</p>



<h2 id="h-quests-in-helvetia"><strong>Quests in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<p>You won’t find typical quests in Helvetia, though you will partake in various events, such as <strong>Fasnacht Day</strong>. It’s an annual event that brings players together to help the Protectrons of Helvetia celebrate the iconic albeit strange holiday commonly found in West Virginia. It’s characterized by strange masks, cheerful music, and plenty of brews to wash down the radiation.</p>







<h2 id="h-creatures-in-helvetia"><strong>Creatures in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On an average day, Helvetia is quiet. It’s home to a handful of <strong>Scorched</strong>, none of which pose much of a threat to a terrifying Vault Dweller such as yourself, right? But during Fasnacht, the town starts to experience the hustle and bustle of the wasteland. During the annual event, you’ll stumble upon:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bee Swarms</strong></li>



<li><strong>Honey Beast</strong></li>



<li><strong>Megasloth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rabbit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radtoad</strong></li>



<li><strong>Squirrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant Suicider</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wolf</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, there’s always the occasional Protectron to assist!</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> players mistakenly received early access to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Patch 8</a>--the final major update for the game--before its scheduled stress test. Now, Larian Studios has announced that the Patch 8 stress test is live, and it's introducing several new features including cross-play.</p><p>To familiarize players with the way cross-play will function, Larian has also released the following video that walks through the necessary steps to join up with friends who are playing on separate consoles or PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qX4ffv7xLsI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prior to launching Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X, Larian was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-add-split-screen-on-xbox-series-s-after-launch/1100-6517248/" data-ref-id="1100-6517248">forced to drop the split-screen feature from Xbox Series S.</a> After Patch 8, Series S users will finally get the split-screen option that Series X players have enjoyed since 2023. </p><p>Photo Mode is another prominent addition in Patch 8, alongside the 12 new subclasses that players can select. Larian notes that there are some known bugs that are still being worked out, which is why the stress test is being used to identify these issues before the official Patch 8 rollout begins to every player. </p><p>Once Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio's full attention will go to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced two new supplements coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. One of those is a new Eberron 2025 supplement, bringing players back to one of the fantasy TTRPG's most beloved settings.</p>

<h2>The Eberron 2025 Supplement Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/d-d-adds-two-new-books-to-2025-slate-including-new-eberron-book.710194/#post-9568885" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, the Eberron 2025 supplement has been added to Wizards of the Coast's upcoming slate of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books coming this year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=XUICQ1Tk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=VktmOXzJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Eberron is the name of an original setting set in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> . It was created by Keith Baker, James Wyatt, and Bill Slavicsek and debuted in 2004 for <em>D&amp;D 3.5 Edition</em>. It is a setting distinct from Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms for its introduction of fantasy technology like trains, airships, automatons known as Warforged and iconic arcane tinkerers: Artificers.</p>

<p>The Eberron supplement, officially titled <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, will come to store fronts this August. The book will be a companion to the previously released book, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, and will contain new player options, bastion options tied to the Eberron setting, and new airship rules.</p>

<p>Among those new player options is the revised Artificer class. This aligns with Wizards of the Coast recently releasing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Artificer playtest material</a> for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> after the class was conspicuously absent from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Eberron 2025 will contain some changes to the setting's lore. Dragonmarked houses are no longer species-locked , players can join any house. In addition, dragonmarks will be made into more fully fleshed out Feats including pre-requisites Lastly, the Khoravar, originally treated as a form of half-elf, will now be treated as a separate player species.</p>

<p>The design team on this new supplement will include James Wyatt and Keith Baker will act as a consultant.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Eberron 2025 supplement is in keeping with Wizards of the Coast's latest wave of books for the latest iteration of their fantasy TTRPG. Their release slate also includes a <em>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</em> containing 8 new subclasses and a <em>Forgotten Realms Adventurer's Guide</em> providing GMs with worldbuilding details on the land of Faerun.</p>

<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>

                <p>Destiny is getting crossover content with one of the biggest sci-fi franchises on the planet, as Bungie has announced a partnership with Lucasfilm to bring Star Wars content to Destiny 2.</p><p>Launching on February 4 with the Destiny 2: Heresy update, the Star Wars content includes new armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are "inspired by Star Wars." More specifically, the armor ornaments include one per Guardian class, and they are inspired by soldiers of the Galactic Empire. You can get a glimpse at the new armor in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673" data-ratio="0.56791569086651" data-width="854" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673"></a><figcaption>Destiny x Star Wars launches in February.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png"></figure><p>Destiny 2 has welcomed a number of licensed crossovers before, including franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lets-you-cosplay-as-commander-shepard-with-mass-effect-cosmetics-out-now/1100-6521058/" data-ref-id="1100-6521058">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-and-destiny-2-crossover-will-introduce-some-trendy-cosmetics-to-both-games/1100-6509625/" data-ref-id="1100-6509625">Assassin's Creed</a>, but Star Wars is the biggest yet in terms of prominence.</p><p>Bungie announced the Star Wars crossover and lots more during a broadcast on January 28. Also as part of this, Bungie confirmed that the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dreadnaught is returning to Destiny in Destiny 2: Heresy</a>, which is the final epilogue of the so-called Light and Darkness saga.</p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," Destiny 2 narrative architect Nikko Stevens said. "The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>In other Bungie news, the company underwent significant changes in 2024 when it announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a restructuring that will see some staffers form a new team inside parent company Sony to make a new game.</a> In addition to ongoing support for Destiny 2, Bungie is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">working on Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-dev-teases-sci-fi-project-inspired-by-frogs-comedy-mobas-and-fighting-games/1100-6517010/" data-ref-id="1100-6517010">a game inspired by frogs and comedy.</a></p>

                <p>Donkey Kong could be headed for an overall redesign. Fans got a quick glimpse of the great ape in the Switch 2 demo reel with (what appears to be) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">Mario Kart 9</a>, but it seems the new look for DK isn't just for the game, but in merchandise as well.</p><p>It's not the first time Donkey Kong has been given a facelift since his original design in 1981, which was more like King Kong, and then completely overhauled with Rare's Donkey Kong Country franchise. His solo series gave him a necktie, a subtle hair wave, smaller nostrils, and a furrowed brow that always made him look slightly perturbed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="134599070" data-promo-id="0"

Movie, which eagle-eyed fans have noticed on Nintendo's <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_CMAAT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese merchandise</a>. The brow was scaled back, giving him a sort of kinder, rounder look. DK's superfans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1iahhoh/history_is_being_rewritten_in_front_of_our_very/?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> weighed in on the design with some not sure, while others were in favor of the new look. </p><p>"At first I was against the design change, however after looking at it more I agree that it better allows DK to convey facial expressions and emotion. Before DK just kinda always looked angry? The brow reduction allows a greater range of expression and honestly looks pretty good once you get over the initial surprise of the change," one user said.</p><p>For now, it's just Donkey Kong himself getting a new look though it's unclear if Diddy Kong and the rest of the Kong family will be spared.</p>

			<p>2025 is going to be a jam-packed year for new games being released, but who could forget about the many DLCs and expansions that are confirmed to be happening this year? Admittedly, some have yet to be detailed or even announced, but the ones that have been are bound to keep you watching the calendar for their release date. Without further ado, here is Wccftech's most anticipated DLC of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atomic-Heart-DLC-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea (January 28)</h2>
<p>This expansion actually launches today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 2023 launch</a>, Atomic Heart has already received two DLCs, both of which have been welcomed with mixed feelings across the board. However, the third time's the charm, right? In this DLC, you will return to Facility 3826 as Major P-3, with Twin at your side as you go diving into the depths and explore uncharted watery depths to try and save humanity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/age-of-empires-4HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Age of Empires 4 Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>The name of the upcoming DLC hasn't been revealed yet, but World's Edge has confirmed that there will be a new DLC coming at some point in 2025 for Age of Empires 4. So far, the game has received a lot of seasonal content, but it has also received a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-anniversary-season-3-upate-ottomans-malians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> and paid DLC. These DLCs have added the Ottomans and Malians to the game, as well as a paid DLC called The Sultans Ascend, which added other civilizations to the game. Hopefully, the DLC is what the fans have been hoping for.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Indiana-Jones-Giants-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle - The Order of Giants (TBA)</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best games released in 2024</a>. Needless to say, we're eager to get our hands on its announced story-driven DLC, The Order of Giants, which is included with the purchase of the Premium Edition. As implied by the title, this expansion should shine further light on the secretive organization that the main game reveals to be actually named Nephilim Order. There's little doubt that Indiana will once again face many shenanigans in this new adventure, though we don't know who else might appear in it - could we see other familiar faces from the movies? Only time will tell.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lies-of-P-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Lies of P Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is another DLC that doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">confirmed release date yet</a>. However, we do know that it is slated for release this year, possibly in the first quarter, while Neowiz is also working on a sequel to Lies of P that is coming in the future. It's uncertain as to what this DLC will be about, but it's perfect for those who enjoyed Lies of P or are wanting more of the soulslike experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rain-world-the-watcher-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Rain World: The Watcher (March 28)</h2>
<p>Rain World has already received a fair bit of new content over the years since its release in 2017, with Downpour being the first major DLC that the game received back in 2023. Luckily, for those who are a fan of the slugcats, Rain World will be getting its second paid DLC, named The Watcher, released on March 28, 2025. While January has been going on for what feels like ten years, it will soon be over, meaning March will be even closer than before.</p>

As such, you’ll want to bring your best self to each mission. Below, we’ve got a handful of tips we think might help you do exactly that, so take a look and put ‘em to good use.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h39073"><a id="ping"></a>Take it slow and ping your foes</h2><p>This kind of goes without saying, but <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is, uh, a game about sniping. You can go in guns blazing in certain situations, but you’ll generally want to keep a slow and steady pace. Much of your time will be spent planning how to approach a scenario, so you’ll want to keep tabs on where all of the bad guys are walking around.</p><p>To do this, you can break out your binoculars or simply aim down your sniper’s sight with the reticle on an enemy. Train your sights on them and let the small bar above their head fill up, which will then leave a ping on them for you so that you know where they are at all times. This can make a world of difference when you’re ready to infiltrate populated areas—though be prepared to take quick (and quiet) action against any random enemies you may have overlooked.</p><h2 id="h39074"><a id="noise"></a>Use noise to your advantage</h2><p>There are a variety of ways in which you can mask the sound of your sniper. You’ll come across generators you can sabotage to make noise, or even use the sound of thunder on a rainy night. You can tell when your sniper shots will be masked by looking for a wavy noise indicator at the very top of your screen. Plan to pop noggins when this is on your screen and you’ll be less likely to attract the attention of other soldiers in the area.</p><h2 id="h39075"><a id="axis"></a>Turn off Axis Invasions if you want a solo experience</h2><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> features a mechanic that allows another real person to infiltrate your game and try to kill you (similar to invasions in <em>Dark Souls</em>). Luckily, <strong>if that’s not your jam, you can turn off this feature in the settings under the “Game” tab</strong>. The first option here is “Allow Axis Invasions,” and you can switch it on or off, or you can select to have invasions happen exclusively when you invite someone.</p><h2 id="h39076"><a id="yellow"></a>Never pass up yellow items</h2><p>As you play through levels, you’ll come across items that glow yellow when you’re nearby. These are often things like Satchel Charges, Crowbars, Bolt Cutters, useful keys, or even objective-related items. You should always pick up these items, as they’re always there for a good reason. If you pass up a Satchel Charge and then reach an objective that needs one, it’s going to be a pain in the ass to trace your steps back to where it was. Be proactive, dammit!</p><h2 id="h39077"><a id="health"></a>Buy health upgrades ASAP</h2><p>Make sure to snag the two Health Boost skills. Getting shot hurts like hell in <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, so you’ll need all the cushion you can get on your health bar. Additionally, grab the Speedy Recovery skill to ensure that your health regenerates rapidly after you’ve taken a hit or two. You’ll be happy you did when you find yourself in the game’s most hectic shootouts.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On the surface, Medieval Dynasty looks like the type of pump-and-dump indie game that studios toss out to earn a quick buck before moving on to the next project. But that’s utterly incorrect in this case, as developer Render Cube continues to impress with content update after update. The most recent release, Medieval Dynasty update 2.3, allows us to paint buildings, construct house presets, stack items, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-medieval-dynasty-update-2-3">What’s New in Medieval Dynasty Update 2.3?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Right, so the house presets, economy tab, and item stacking are excellent additions that will make life in Medieval Dynasty ten times easier. But let’s be honest, we’re all here for the ability to paint our structures. We can have a brightly-colored town, ready to catch a trader’s eye or perhaps a wolf. It’s likely the latter.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a>, the free-to-play MMORPG from Korean developer NCSOFT and publisher Amazon, is set to receive its first major content update on March 6 when its Wilds of Talandre expansion arrives. The update will overhaul some of the game's existing systems while additionally adding all new ones like Artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name of the expansion implies and as detailed in a <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the update will add the new zone of Talandre. There the game's story will continue as players progress their characters to the new level cap of 55, all the while participating in new world events and field dungeons.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIXmI-iiyew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIXmI-iiyew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are big changes coming to Throne and Liberty's endgame too, with the update set to introduce a new activity in the form of Solo Dungeons. These are intended as a way to ease players into more difficult endgame group content. Those looking for a true endgame challenge will be able to tackle new 3-Star difficulty dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of systems, Throne and Liberty's current Weapon Mastery mechanic will be getting revamped. Details are still light for now, but Amazon states that it will add "another layer of personalization" to progressing weapons, allowing players to alter or empower specific skills. Current Weapon Mastery levels will be converted into experience points in the new system.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Weapon Mastery changes, a new Artifact system is also being introduced. In what sounds similar to tier sets from other MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, acquiring sets of Artifact gear will activate bonuses by equipping two, four, and six pieces of the same set. Two pieces of each set consist of a Solar Stone and Lunar Stone, which grant an active skill and passive skill respectively. This new type of gear can only be acquired from Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region or from Nebula Island, a new time-restricted area that features hourly events and periodic field bosses.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-launches-to-big-concurrent-player-numbers-but-not-as-big-as-new-world-or-lost-ark/1100-6526849/" data-ref-id="1100-6526849">Throne and Liberty launched in October 2024 to big concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>, even if they were smaller compared to Amazon's previous MMO launches for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>. Though its player counts have been steadily declining, it still regularly ranks among the top 50 most-played games on Steam by player count. Its most recent significant update came in December, when Throne and Liberty added the <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/the-call-of-the-spear-release-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spear</a> as a new weapon.</p>
