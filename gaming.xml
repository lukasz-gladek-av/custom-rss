			<p>Last year, fans of adventure games <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were treated to a great release schedule</a>. Can 2025 match or even surpass it? Possibly, thanks to several experienced studios like Don't Nod and Hazelight, which have proved to be masters of the genre time and again. We still don't have a release date for The Wolf Among Us 2; Telltale <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a few months ago that the long-anticipated sequel isn't canceled, but it doesn't sound like it's coming in 2025. Thankfully, in the meantime, there'll be plenty of fun to be had between triple-A and independent productions.</p>

<h2>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage (February 18, April 15)</h2>
<p>The creators of Life is Strange return with a sort of spiritual successor titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>. The story will be split into two episodes, scheduled to be released around two months apart.</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is set in the fictional town of Velvet Cove, Michigan, and features four former friends (Nora, Autumn, Kat, and Swann) who are reunited after 27 years. As Swann, players will actually navigate two different timelines: the Summer of 1995, when their friendship blossomed, and 2022, when the group gets together again despite having sworn not to speak again after they had buried a secret together. Don't Nod promises players will be able to shape both timelines somehow, while dialogue will feel more realistic thanks to the ability to ignore or interrupt what the others have just said. Given the studio's pedigree in the adventure games genre, this is likely one of the most widely anticipated titles.</p>

<h2>Split Fiction (March 6)</h2>
<p>After the enormous success of 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won many awards and sold over 20 million copies, Josef Fares and his Hazelight Studio are about to try again with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-split-fiction-trailer-showcases-co-op-gameplay-and-side-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Fiction</a>. Once more, this adventure game has been designed specifically to be played in split-screen cooperative multiplayer, so you'll need a friend to experience it.</p>
<p>This time around, the main characters are Mio and Zoe, two writers who work on sci-fi and fantasy, respectively. The beginning of the narrative sees them being trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. They don't really feel much for one another at first, but they must work together if they are to escape this prison, mastering a variety of skills and overcoming various challenges as they jump between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds they had envisioned in their works.</p>

<h2>South of Midnight (April 8, PC and Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>The first project developed by Compulsion Games since they were acquired by Microsoft is undoubtedly an action/adventure game with a fair amount of action and puzzles. However, the developers have stressed that the story, rather than the gameplay, is the main focus of <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. In a fantasy world inspired by Deep Southern Gothic tales, protagonist Hazel suddenly becomes a Weaver, a magic user who repairs broken spirits and bonds.</p>
<p>The stop-motion-inspired visuals are certainly catchy, but Hazel's journey—both across the land and within herself—should take center stage when the game launches in early April.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Karma-The-Dark-World-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>KARMA: The Dark World (TBA)</h2>
<p>Shanghai-based developer Pollard Studio managed to stand out among the sea of upcoming new game releases with its debut project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The developers described it as a first-person cinematic psychological thriller set in a dystopian 1984 East Germany.</p>
<p>In this alternate timeline, the Leviathan Corporation rules society with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, strict social class rules, mind-altering drugs, and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who obey. As Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau, players will get to use advanced tech to enter the minds of the accused, investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings to Leviathan.</p>
<p>Through a combination of investigative tools and interviews, players will solve puzzles and uncover the truth of a dark tale of love, loss, and deception where nothing is what it seems, and every twist and turn brings a new twist to unravel.</p>

<h2>Spirit of the North 2 (TBA)</h2>
<p>The cute fox from 2020's Spirit of the North returns in the sequel to this peculiar adventure game franchise. In Spirit of the North 2, players will be transported to an ancient world in ruins. As a lonely fox, with the help of a wise raven companion, they must find the lost legendary guardians and free them from the grasp of a dark shaman called Grimnir.</p>
<p>These corrupted guardians will have to be defeated and subsequently cleansed in puzzle-based encounters. Developer Infuse Studio also promised a large and ancient open world to explore, filled with history to discover, not to mention challenges to overcome and secrets to unlock.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-festival-is-bringing-sabrina-carpenter-next-season-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1094313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to reliable insiders, Fortnite Festival’s next Season will have Sabrina Carpenter at the centre stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1884279980621979689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>), Fortnite Festival’s next Season will seemingly focus on the artist behind some of the most popular tunes of 2024, Sabrina Carpenter. If the ‘Espresso’ singer turns out to be the icon of the Fortnite Festival Season 8, then players can expect a bunch of new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like previous Icons, the Fortnite Festival could receive a music pass with a Sabrina Carpenter skin, new emotes, and cosmetics. The popular singer might also be featured in the Fortnite Item shop as a bundle with exclusive items. However, it is hard to confirm anything without an official announcement. </p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter has already collaborated with Fortnite in August 2024, where players received a couple of emotes and jam tracks featuring popular songs from the artist but no skins. So it isn’t very farfetched to expect Sabrina Carpenter to be the main attraction of Fortnite Festival’s next Season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the same duo responsible for this leak claimed Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman Skins</a>. Also, here’s everything you need to know about Fortnite’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-event-release-date-godzilla-skin-king-kong-crossover-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla event</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every year, the best VALORANT team at the world is crowned at VALORANT Champions, which serves as the world championship for Riot Games’ agent-filled tactical shooter. Over time, the event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has drawn larger audiences as the game expands its global reach</a>, and that reach is exemplified in all the different regions that have claimed the trophy at VALORANT Champions.</p>



<p>VALORANT may have a shorter history than several other esports titles, but that just makes the hall of Champions winners that much more exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-champions-winners-in-order">All VALORANT Champions Winners, In Order</h2>



<p>There have been four VALORANT Champions winners so far, beginning with the inaugural tournament in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-acend-2021">Acend – 2021</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Jianhua Chen for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Acend’s story has somewhat of a sad ending, as the organization didn’t acquire partnership in the VCT international leagues, and was <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to close its doors</a> in 2024 due to unsustainability. But the organization and its players still hold the distinction of being the first ever VALORANT Champions winners, defeating a Gambit team that had dominated the scene for virtually the entire year in a thrilling five-map series in the grand finals.</p>



<ul>
<li>Santeri “BONECOLD” Sassi</li>



<li>Mehmet “cNed” İpek</li>



<li>Vladyslav “Kiles” Shvets</li>



<li>Patryk “starxo” Kopczyński</li>



<li>Aleksander “zeek” Zygmunt</li>



<li>Laurynas “Nbs” Kisielius (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-loud-2022">LOUD – 2022</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Brazilian organization LOUD entered VALORANT at the start of 2022, and finished the year with a world championship. LOUD pulled the best talent from Brazil together under one electric green banner, and found a rival wearing green themselves in OpTic Gaming. The two teams faced each other six times during the 2022 season, but LOUD got the last laugh in the upper bracket final and the grand final of Champions 2023.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bryan “pANcada” Luna</li>



<li>Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi</li>



<li>Matias “Saadhak” Delipetro</li>



<li>Erick “aspas” Santos</li>



<li>Felipe “Less” Basso</li>



<li>Matheus “bzkA” Tarasconi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-evil-geniuses-2023">Evil Geniuses – 2023</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evil Geniuses’ championship run in 2023 is considered one of the miraculous runs in the history of esports. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coach Christine “potter” Chi</a> started with a roster of lowly regarded players and added a completely unknown player from an open tryout mid-season. The North American team stunned the international audience with a grand finals run at Masters Tokyo, then knocked off Champions contenders like DRX, LOUD, and finally Paper Rex to win the world championship in front of a Los Angeles home crowd.</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</li>



<li>Ethan “Ethan” Arnold</li>



<li>Alexander “jawgemo” Mor</li>



<li>Corbin “C0M” Lee</li>



<li>Max “Demon1” Mazanov</li>



<li>Christine “potter” Chi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-edward-gaming-2024">EDward Gaming – 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ expansion of the international VALORANT esports ecosystem into China couldn’t have gone any better for the region. EDward Gaming, after dominating the Chinese scene again but falling short on the international stage, finally had their moment at Champions 2024. In Seoul, EDG went undefeated in playoffs, defeating Team Heretics in an amazing grand final, cementing Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang as the top star of Chinese VALORANT.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wan “CHICHOO” Shunzhi</li>



<li>Wang “nobody” Senxu</li>



<li>Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang</li>



<li>Zhang “Smoggy” Zhao</li>



<li>Hsieh “S1Mon” Meng-hsun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun (coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>Across these four years of VALORANT, no team has accomplished the feat of winning both a Masters event and Champions. Only one player has accomplished this: Sacy, who won Champions 2022 with LOUD and Masters Madrid 2024 with Sentinels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie announced today that Destiny 2 will receive Star Wars skins and cosmetics on February 4, 2025, along with the game’s third and final Episode, Heresy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have only <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1884318035000938780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teased</a> the upcoming Destiny 2 Star Wars skins and cosmetics, and we have yet to learn what exactly will be released. Players should expect new armour ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers inspired by Star Wars. Additionally, at the launch of Heresy, three new armour ornaments (one per Guardian class) will become available. And the inspiration for these ornaments will be “the soldiers of the Galactic Empire”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-heresy-act-1">Destiny 2’s Heresy Act 1</h2>



<p>Apart from the Destiny 2 x Star Wars collaboration, the developers have released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details</a> about their third episode and final epilogue, Heresy. Guardians should expect the return of a familiar foe: the Dreadnaught. However, this time, the players will take the fight to the Dreadnaught through a new exploration and combat-based activity: The Nether.&nbsp;The Heresy Episode will consist of three Acts. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers will experiment with player modifiers in the upcoming Destiny 2 update. Once the Heresy update arrives, players will observe new modifiers “with increased health pools, no regenerating of health, low ammo drops and revive tokens, and a modification on healing in the sandbox over the course of play.” Bungie wants players to strategically build their loadouts for survivability as health pools increase and regen is stopped in the upcoming update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, according to claims, Bungie’s upcoming MOBA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is inspired by Smash Bros</a>. The development studio allegedly hired fans because they would “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work for less.</a>” What are your thoughts on Destiny 2’s Star Wars collaboration? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the bombs dropping in and around Appalachia, much of the wasteland is barren and rife with danger. But some settlements and tows prove relatively sane and peaceful. Helvetia is neither. It’s a strange haven. But it’s where you’ll find the annual <strong>Fasnacht Event</strong>! Here is where to find Helvetia in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76"><strong>How to Find Helvetia in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find Helvetia in Fallout 76 by venturing into <strong>The Forest region</strong>, an early-game portion of the world map, and then head south of <strong>Morgantown</strong>, along the river, and just east of <strong>Sutton</strong>. It’s a small town with a main road, a three-way intersection, and a handful of buildings, including a church and several residential abodes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, the area is relatively quiet for the post-apocalypse. It’s home to a handful of Scorched on any given day, except during Fasnacht when all hell breaks loose, and people flock to the town in droves to celebrate in strange masks and with music aplenty!</p>



<h2 id="h-quests-in-helvetia"><strong>Quests in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<p>You won’t find typical quests in Helvetia, though you will partake in various events, such as <strong>Fasnacht Day</strong>. It’s an annual event that brings players together to help the Protectrons of Helvetia celebrate the iconic albeit strange holiday commonly found in West Virginia. It’s characterized by strange masks, cheerful music, and plenty of brews to wash down the radiation.</p>







<h2 id="h-creatures-in-helvetia"><strong>Creatures in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On an average day, Helvetia is quiet. It’s home to a handful of <strong>Scorched</strong>, none of which pose much of a threat to a terrifying Vault Dweller such as yourself, right? But during Fasnacht, the town starts to experience the hustle and bustle of the wasteland. During the annual event, you’ll stumble upon:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bee Swarms</strong></li>



<li><strong>Honey Beast</strong></li>



<li><strong>Megasloth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rabbit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radtoad</strong></li>



<li><strong>Squirrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant Suicider</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wolf</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, there’s always the occasional Protectron to assist!</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> players mistakenly received early access to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Patch 8</a>--the final major update for the game--before its scheduled stress test. Now, Larian Studios has announced that the Patch 8 stress test is live, and it's introducing several new features including cross-play.</p><p>To familiarize players with the way cross-play will function, Larian has also released the following video that walks through the necessary steps to join up with friends who are playing on separate consoles or PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qX4ffv7xLsI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prior to launching Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X, Larian was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-add-split-screen-on-xbox-series-s-after-launch/1100-6517248/" data-ref-id="1100-6517248">forced to drop the split-screen feature from Xbox Series S.</a> After Patch 8, Series S users will finally get the split-screen option that Series X players have enjoyed since 2023. </p><p>Photo Mode is another prominent addition in Patch 8, alongside the 12 new subclasses that players can select. Larian notes that there are some known bugs that are still being worked out, which is why the stress test is being used to identify these issues before the official Patch 8 rollout begins to every player. </p><p>Once Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio's full attention will go to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced two new supplements coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. One of those is a new Eberron 2025 supplement, bringing players back to one of the fantasy TTRPG's most beloved settings.</p>

<h2>The Eberron 2025 Supplement Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/d-d-adds-two-new-books-to-2025-slate-including-new-eberron-book.710194/#post-9568885" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, the Eberron 2025 supplement has been added to Wizards of the Coast's upcoming slate of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books coming this year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=XUICQ1Tk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=VktmOXzJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Eberron is the name of an original setting set in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> . It was created by Keith Baker, James Wyatt, and Bill Slavicsek and debuted in 2004 for <em>D&amp;D 3.5 Edition</em>. It is a setting distinct from Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms for its introduction of fantasy technology like trains, airships, automatons known as Warforged and iconic arcane tinkerers: Artificers.</p>

<p>The Eberron supplement, officially titled <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, will come to store fronts this August. The book will be a companion to the previously released book, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, and will contain new player options, bastion options tied to the Eberron setting, and new airship rules.</p>

<p>Among those new player options is the revised Artificer class. This aligns with Wizards of the Coast recently releasing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Artificer playtest material</a> for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> after the class was conspicuously absent from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Eberron 2025 will contain some changes to the setting's lore. Dragonmarked houses are no longer species-locked , players can join any house. In addition, dragonmarks will be made into more fully fleshed out Feats including pre-requisites Lastly, the Khoravar, originally treated as a form of half-elf, will now be treated as a separate player species.</p>

<p>The design team on this new supplement will include James Wyatt and Keith Baker will act as a consultant.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Eberron 2025 supplement is in keeping with Wizards of the Coast's latest wave of books for the latest iteration of their fantasy TTRPG. Their release slate also includes a <em>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</em> containing 8 new subclasses and a <em>Forgotten Realms Adventurer's Guide</em> providing GMs with worldbuilding details on the land of Faerun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-vr-developer-fast-travel-games-hit-with-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>

                <p>Destiny is getting crossover content with one of the biggest sci-fi franchises on the planet, as Bungie has announced a partnership with Lucasfilm to bring Star Wars content to Destiny 2.</p><p>Launching on February 4 with the Destiny 2: Heresy update, the Star Wars content includes new armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are "inspired by Star Wars." More specifically, the armor ornaments include one per Guardian class, and they are inspired by soldiers of the Galactic Empire. You can get a glimpse at the new armor in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673" data-ratio="0.56791569086651" data-width="854" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673"></a><figcaption>Destiny x Star Wars launches in February.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png"></figure><p>Destiny 2 has welcomed a number of licensed crossovers before, including franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lets-you-cosplay-as-commander-shepard-with-mass-effect-cosmetics-out-now/1100-6521058/" data-ref-id="1100-6521058">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-and-destiny-2-crossover-will-introduce-some-trendy-cosmetics-to-both-games/1100-6509625/" data-ref-id="1100-6509625">Assassin's Creed</a>, but Star Wars is the biggest yet in terms of prominence.</p><p>Bungie announced the Star Wars crossover and lots more during a broadcast on January 28.

"The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>In other Bungie news, the company underwent significant changes in 2024 when it announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a restructuring that will see some staffers form a new team inside parent company Sony to make a new game.</a> In addition to ongoing support for Destiny 2, Bungie is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">working on Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-dev-teases-sci-fi-project-inspired-by-frogs-comedy-mobas-and-fighting-games/1100-6517010/" data-ref-id="1100-6517010">a game inspired by frogs and comedy.</a></p>

                <p>Donkey Kong could be headed for an overall redesign. Fans got a quick glimpse of the great ape in the Switch 2 demo reel with (what appears to be) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">Mario Kart 9</a>, but it seems the new look for DK isn't just for the game, but in merchandise as well.</p><p>It's not the first time Donkey Kong has been given a facelift since his original design in 1981, which was more like King Kong, and then completely overhauled with Rare's Donkey Kong Country franchise. His solo series gave him a necktie, a subtle hair wave, smaller nostrils, and a furrowed brow that always made him look slightly perturbed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="525557774" data-promo-id="0"

Movie, which eagle-eyed fans have noticed on Nintendo's <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_CMAAT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese merchandise</a>. The brow was scaled back, giving him a sort of kinder, rounder look. DK's superfans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1iahhoh/history_is_being_rewritten_in_front_of_our_very/?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> weighed in on the design with some not sure, while others were in favor of the new look. </p><p>"At first I was against the design change, however after looking at it more I agree that it better allows DK to convey facial expressions and emotion. Before DK just kinda always looked angry? The brow reduction allows a greater range of expression and honestly looks pretty good once you get over the initial surprise of the change," one user said.</p><p>For now, it's just Donkey Kong himself getting a new look though it's unclear if Diddy Kong and the rest of the Kong family will be spared.</p>

			<p>2025 is going to be a jam-packed year for new games being released, but who could forget about the many DLCs and expansions that are confirmed to be happening this year? Admittedly, some have yet to be detailed or even announced, but the ones that have been are bound to keep you watching the calendar for their release date. Without further ado, here is Wccftech's most anticipated DLC of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atomic-Heart-DLC-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea (January 28)</h2>
<p>This expansion actually launches today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 2023 launch</a>, Atomic Heart has already received two DLCs, both of which have been welcomed with mixed feelings across the board. However, the third time's the charm, right? In this DLC, you will return to Facility 3826 as Major P-3, with Twin at your side as you go diving into the depths and explore uncharted watery depths to try and save humanity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/age-of-empires-4HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Age of Empires 4 Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>The name of the upcoming DLC hasn't been revealed yet, but World's Edge has confirmed that there will be a new DLC coming at some point in 2025 for Age of Empires 4. So far, the game has received a lot of seasonal content, but it has also received a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-anniversary-season-3-upate-ottomans-malians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> and paid DLC. These DLCs have added the Ottomans and Malians to the game, as well as a paid DLC called The Sultans Ascend, which added other civilizations to the game. Hopefully, the DLC is what the fans have been hoping for.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Indiana-Jones-Giants-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle - The Order of Giants (TBA)</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best games released in 2024</a>. Needless to say, we're eager to get our hands on its announced story-driven DLC, The Order of Giants, which is included with the purchase of the Premium Edition. As implied by the title, this expansion should shine further light on the secretive organization that the main game reveals to be actually named Nephilim Order. There's little doubt that Indiana will once again face many shenanigans in this new adventure, though we don't know who else might appear in it - could we see other familiar faces from the movies? Only time will tell.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lies-of-P-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Lies of P Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is another DLC that doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">confirmed release date yet</a>. However, we do know that it is slated for release this year, possibly in the first quarter, while Neowiz is also working on a sequel to Lies of P that is coming in the future. It's uncertain as to what this DLC will be about, but it's perfect for those who enjoyed Lies of P or are wanting more of the soulslike experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rain-world-the-watcher-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Rain World: The Watcher (March 28)</h2>
<p>Rain World has already received a fair bit of new content over the years since its release in 2017, with Downpour being the first major DLC that the game received back in 2023. Luckily, for those who are a fan of the slugcats, Rain World will be getting its second paid DLC, named The Watcher, released on March 28, 2025. While January has been going on for what feels like ten years, it will soon be over, meaning March will be even closer than before.</p>

As such, you’ll want to bring your best self to each mission. Below, we’ve got a handful of tips we think might help you do exactly that, so take a look and put ‘em to good use.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h45319"><a id="ping"></a>Take it slow and ping your foes</h2><p>This kind of goes without saying, but <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is, uh, a game about sniping. You can go in guns blazing in certain situations, but you’ll generally want to keep a slow and steady pace. Much of your time will be spent planning how to approach a scenario, so you’ll want to keep tabs on where all of the bad guys are walking around.</p><p>To do this, you can break out your binoculars or simply aim down your sniper’s sight with the reticle on an enemy. Train your sights on them and let the small bar above their head fill up, which will then leave a ping on them for you so that you know where they are at all times. This can make a world of difference when you’re ready to infiltrate populated areas—though be prepared to take quick (and quiet) action against any random enemies you may have overlooked.</p><h2 id="h45320"><a id="noise"></a>Use noise to your advantage</h2><p>There are a variety of ways in which you can mask the sound of your sniper. You’ll come across generators you can sabotage to make noise, or even use the sound of thunder on a rainy night. You can tell when your sniper shots will be masked by looking for a wavy noise indicator at the very top of your screen. Plan to pop noggins when this is on your screen and you’ll be less likely to attract the attention of other soldiers in the area.</p><h2 id="h45321"><a id="axis"></a>Turn off Axis Invasions if you want a solo experience</h2><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> features a mechanic that allows another real person to infiltrate your game and try to kill you (similar to invasions in <em>Dark Souls</em>). Luckily, <strong>if that’s not your jam, you can turn off this feature in the settings under the “Game” tab</strong>. The first option here is “Allow Axis Invasions,” and you can switch it on or off, or you can select to have invasions happen exclusively when you invite someone.</p><h2 id="h45322"><a id="yellow"></a>Never pass up yellow items</h2><p>As you play through levels, you’ll come across items that glow yellow when you’re nearby. These are often things like Satchel Charges, Crowbars, Bolt Cutters, useful keys, or even objective-related items. You should always pick up these items, as they’re always there for a good reason. If you pass up a Satchel Charge and then reach an objective that needs one, it’s going to be a pain in the ass to trace your steps back to where it was. Be proactive, dammit!</p><h2 id="h45323"><a id="health"></a>Buy health upgrades ASAP</h2><p>Make sure to snag the two Health Boost skills. Getting shot hurts like hell in <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, so you’ll need all the cushion you can get on your health bar. Additionally, grab the Speedy Recovery skill to ensure that your health regenerates rapidly after you’ve taken a hit or two. You’ll be happy you did when you find yourself in the game’s most hectic shootouts.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
