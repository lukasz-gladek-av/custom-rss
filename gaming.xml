            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Was The Most-Searched Game of 2025, Despite Dropping in October]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/</link>
            <guid>1373998</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Google Trends has just published its Year in Search report for 2025, and it uncovers a juicy tidbit about Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders, the all-new extraction adventure that has taken the gaming world by storm in the last few weeks. The game was released on October 30 to an overwhelmingly positive reception and has been on the upswing ever since.</p>



<p>Google’s new report revealed that, in 2025, ARC Raiders was the <strong>most-searched game</strong>, despite being released at the tail end of October. It beat all comers to hold the top spot, which is indicative of the sheer amount of interest around this game.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been scoring high in the review stakes, securing award nominations, and holding a consistent audience of hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. It’s arguably the most accessible extraction game ever made, and it has turned the tide for a genre otherwise thought of as being ‘too challenging’ for the average gamer.</p>



<p>That’s partly why ARC Raiders was the most-searched game in 2025 on Google, which was confirmed in a recent report published by the Google Trends team.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025/">the full list</a>, and it might surprise you where certain games fall:</p>



<ol>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Strands</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>It might come as a shock to see GTA 6 so far down the line, but that’s mostly because it’s a case of gamers biding their time until news surfaces. There’s almost nothing to search for otherwise related to Grand Theft Auto 6. On the other hand, ARC Raiders has mission guides, item location tips, loadout walkthroughs, and more, all of which are being eagerly sought out by players far and wide.</p>







<p>It’s a well-deserved accolade for ARC Raiders, which has turned out to be a stunning game that has impressed players more than anyone truly expected. Embark Studios has promised to support the game for years to come, so only bright things are in store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision hasn’t officially unveiled this season’s Call of Duty League skins, and until now, all we’ve seen is the default Call of Duty League Launch pack. That is, until one user on social media uploaded a video showcasing all the CDL 2026 skins in the Call of Duty store.</p>



<p>Thanks to the short video, we now know what every CDL 2026 skin looks like, and this year, they’re more customized per team than they have been in a minute, with a special focus on the skin’s face mask layout.</p>







<p>On social media, user RealityUK uploaded a two-minute video detailing every CDL 2026 Operator skin. This included a brief snapshot of every team competing in this season’s Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>FaZe Vegas</li>



<li>G2 Minnesota</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Paris Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Riyadh Falcons</li>



<li>Toronto KOI</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video, provided by Reality:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The feedback on the leaked CDL skins was mixed, with many coming to claim that their favorite teams were ‘done dirty’ by the skin designers. Many had issues with OpTic Texas’ skin in the video, one of which (the away skin) was almost a plain, stark white with no OpTic colorways.</p>



<p>One user wrote, <em>‘Why does OpTic look so barebones? They are getting more revenue this year the more people buy it’s not fixed anymore why did they go so basic I’m confused?’</em></p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed are the incoming weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and charms associated with each CDL team. It typically costs around $9.99 to purchase a CDL skin pack, and when doing so, you’ll unlock all the above, but all we’ve seen leaked thus far are the Operator skins themselves.</p>



<p>Is there a particular skin standing out to you? Let us know on the I<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">nsider Gaming Discord server</a> which you’d want to invest in.</p>

<p>To mark this occasion, Metacritic has now <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/every-metroid-game-ranked-worst-to-best/">rounded up <em>every</em> Metroid game</a> in its database to share a look at each title's metascore (based on the aggregate score of critic reviews). This includes not only the Prime games but also the spin-offs, Samus' 2D outings, and the re-releases.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are some omissions – including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> (NES, 1987), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> (Game Boy, 1991), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> (SNES, 1994), and that's simply because these games were released well before Metacritic even existed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceqxnkwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>One other thing to note is the metascore for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is based on the Switch 2 Edition of the game. Switch reviews are still 'TBD' on Metacritic, although our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">own mini review for this version of the game is now live</a>.</p>

<p>Although these rankings are based on the aggregate of critic scores, if you're looking for a second opinion, we've got our own "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-metroid-games-of-all-time?page=2">best Metroid games of all time</a>" list here on Nintendo Life based on user ratings. The title at the top of our list is Super Metroid, with the original Prime entry in second place and Metroid Dread in third. We've not added Prime 4 to this list just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Samus' latest adventure, be sure to check out both of our reviews. The Switch 2 version offers the best experience, but if you're not planning to get a Switch 2 anytime soon, the Switch version is still well worth picking up.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-night-market-coming-back-december-11/</link>
            <guid>1373986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>VALORANT Night Market, the special event that fans of the first-person arena shooter love, is set to return on December 11. This time around, the Night Market will remain open for almost a month, giving players a longer opportunity to secure their dream VALORANT skins.</p>



<p>As always, getting the skins you’re seeking in the Night Market isn’t a <strong>guaranteed thing</strong>, but if you do manage to swing the one you’re after, you’ll secure it at a hugely discounted price.</p>



<p>It’s a little bit of gacha, but it’s good fun for players, and it only comes around once every few months.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next VALORANT Night Market?</h2>



<p>The next VALORANT Night Market has been revealed by Riot Games as coming on December 11. It’s set to run until January 6, giving you plenty of time to hopefully unlock the skins that you’re hunting in this gacha-style event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>How does the Night Market work?</strong></p>



<p>The VALORANT Night Market is a limited-time shop event that offers players six randomly selected weapon skins at discounted prices, ranging from 10% to 49%. The offers are unique per player, and only certain ‘collections’ are selected for the Night Market event.</p>



<p>You simply access the Night Market, click to reveal your discounted skins, and if you want them, you can buy them with a heavy discount. The only drawback is you’re never going to get bundle-exclusive skins or Ultra-tier skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-night-market-december-skins-act-6">VALORANT Night Market December Skins (Act 6)</h2>



<p>There are <strong>stacks </strong>of skins available in the Act 6 Night Market, which runs from December 11 to January 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem to Appear at The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1373938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new look at Resident Evil Requiem will be debuting at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. The event is set to occur on December 11th, with Requiem one of the nominated titles.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27th, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem marks the next chapter in the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, you’ll return to Raccoon City and investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Fans have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-first-and-third-person-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen a lot</a> of the title since its reveal last year, but with rampant rumors and leaks, it seems there’s a lot of mystery still left to discover. Luckily, it won’t be long before players can see more, as the Capcom title is set to show at one of the biggest gaming events of the year.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-debuting-at-the-game-awards">New Look at Resident Evil Requiem Debuting at The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1996731931103580519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards’ official account, <strong>Resident Evil Requiem will be in attendance at the show</strong>. Specifically, <strong>a new look at the title will premiere</strong> at the award show, streaming on <strong>December 11th</strong>. It’s unknown the extent of the first look or content like gameplay or story. Either way, it’s more Resident Evil Requiem, and that’s not a bad thing whatsoever.</p>



<p>It’s a big night for the game, too, as it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. Resident Evil Requiem is up against some heavy-hitters like Grand Theft Auto 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>, 007 First Light, and Marvel’s Wolverine. Fortunately, given the series’ pedigree, with Village, 2 Remake, and 4 Remake getting GOTY nominations, its chances of taking some gold next year are quite good. In any case, there’s a lot more left to look forward to for Requiem as February 27th creeps up.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Many Switch games have been receiving compatibility updates for the Switch 2, and following an update to one of Square Enix's games earlier this week, it seems the indie developer Brace Yourself Games has now rolled out a fix for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>.</p>
<p>If you've been experiencing any crashes when playing this rhythm-based Switch game on the Switch 2, the good news is that a patch has now been rolled out to fix this issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Crypt of the NecroDancer - Switch 2 Update</strong></p>
<p>If you've been having trouble playing Crypt of the NecroDancer on Switch 2, we've got good news to you!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>We just released a patch to fix the issue that was causing the game to crash. Thank you for your patience, and happy gaming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100cea007d08000">compatibility page</a> does not appear to reflect this fix at the time of writing, but if there are any other significant updates to this game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2018. The developer's latest release is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> which is fully compatible on the Switch 2. The Zelda spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cadence_of_hyrule_crypt_of_the_necrodancer_featuring_the_legend_of_zelda">Cadence of Hyrule</a> is also compatible with Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>This follows multiple compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. This included updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, known for his prolific career in film and TV, has passed away. His resume includes roles in The Man in the High Castle, Memories of a Geisha, and, for many, Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat film series. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, the Japanese actor died this morning, surrounded by family in California. His cause of death was due to complications of a stroke. The actor was only 75 years old.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting in 1986 with Big Trouble in Little China, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa had become a prevalent figure in many blockbusters in the 90s and 2000s. Films like License to Kill, Memories of a Geisha, Elektra, and Planet of the Apes brought the actor into the limelight. However, it was his portrayal of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the 1995 film adaptation of Mortal Kombat (and it’s 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation) that made him an icon. While the film was pure 90s, Cary’s devilish portrayal of Tsung was met with high praise, especially for the line “Your Soul is Mine!”.</p>



<p>In the 2010s, Tagawa found himself in roles in projects like The Man in the High Castle, 47 Ronin, and even an adaptation of Tekken as Heihachi Mishima. He even found himself reprising his role as Shang Tsung in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-500m-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, available as DLC. Other video game credits of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa include Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Soldier Boyz.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.</p>

                <p>A new Pokemon game is out next year for Switch 2, and it looks like a wild spin-off from your typical "gotta-catch-'em-all" experience.

One peculiar Ditto returns to find the land withered, and its only remaining resident is a Tangrowth, known simply as Professor Tangrwoth. Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return.</p><p>Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations. Crafting also plays a big role in Pokemon Pokopia, as collected materials can be fashioned into tools and infrastructure to improve buildings and complete quests.</p></div>                      </div><p>Pokemon Pokopia will be the first Nintendo-published game for Switch 2 to be released as a Game Key Card. This means the physical cartridge will serve as an authentication device, and you'll still need to download the full game to your console. It is worth noting that Game Key Cards are not tied to your console, so you can resell them in the future if you choose to. The game will take up roughly 10GBs of space--so if you're planning to buy the game, you'll want to consider picking up a microSD Express card to increase your storage capacity.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-liquidates-tv-backlight-for-more-immersive-movies-now-selling-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000650582</link>
            <guid>1373914</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">just put this TV backlight (<em>3 Lite</em> model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89</a>, which is the <strong>lowest price we’ve ever seen</strong>, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.</p>
<p>This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology<strong> reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV.</strong> This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Fish-Eye Correction Makes Sync More Accurate</h2>
<p>The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to<strong> figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip</strong>. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.</p>
<p>This <strong>model has built-in fish-eye correction</strong> which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.</p>



<p>The<strong> RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips</strong> in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The <strong>11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs</strong> with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.</p>



<p>You can also<strong> control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi</strong>: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to screen sync, <strong>the system has several preset modes</strong>: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.</p>
<p>This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.</p>

<p>From the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of retro-style first-person shooters and want to eradicate swarms of alien bugs, you might want to check out this new game when it arrives in early 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starship-troopers-ultimate-bug-war">Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</a> is developed by Auroch Digital (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>) and published by Dotemu (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>), and will be coming to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>Here's some additional information, and you can listen to General Johnny Rico's recruitment message in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set 25 years after the events of the original <em>Starship</em> Troopers film, this heroic campaign follows war veteran Samantha Dietz as she recounts her hunt for the dreadful Assassin Bug during the First Bug War. Relive her experiences as you annihilate the Arachnids on their familiar home world of Klendathu and journey to all new worlds like Planet P and beyond in this streamlined solo campaign, with access to a devastating arsenal of 14 weapons (including the iconic Morita rifle), 11 Tactical Supports and a Mech vehicle in a gloriously gory 3D pixelated combat simulation.</p>
<p>Citizens looking to prepare themselves to the fullest extent can utilize <em>Starship</em> Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!’s anti-bug combat training, where you can play from the perspective of the Bugs, and prepare for the skills they need to erase the insectoid threat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ditch Your PS5 Slim, PlayStation 5 Pro at New Record Low If You Want to Play at Pro Level]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ps5-slim-playstation-5-pro-at-new-record-low-if-you-want-to-play-at-pro-level-2000650592</link>
            <guid>1373902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony extended Cyber Monday deals by a few extra days with <strong>discounts still active on the PS5 Pro</strong>, DualSense controllers, and PS VR headsets. If you want the <strong>ultimate PlayStation experience with Sony’s most powerful console</strong>, this is it, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">currently sitting at $648 instead of the usual $749 in a record low deal</a>.</p>
<p>This pricing matters because the performance gap between the Pro and the standard PS5 Slim becomes impossible to ignore once you see games running at their maximum potential. The enhanced GPU, advanced ray tracing, and AI upscaling technology solve the compromises that force regular PS5 owners to choose between fidelity and performance modes in demanding titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How the Pro Changes the Way You Play Games</h2>
<p>The <strong>PS5 Pro has a GPU with 67% more compute units</strong> than the standard PS5 Slim, and it means that you get higher frame rates and more detailed graphics without having to change the quality settings. The PS5 Slim can only run games at 30 frames per second in fidelity mode, but the <strong>Pro can run them at 60 frames per second</strong> while keeping the same visual quality which means you don’t have to choose between smooth gameplay and beautiful graphics. You can see this right away in games like Spider-Man 2 or Horizon Forbidden West, where the Pro can handle densely populated cityscapes and complicated environments without the performance drops that sometimes happen on the base console during intense action scenes.</p>



<p>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution uses machine learning to make lower-resolution images look almost like 4K: This is similar to how NVIDIA’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR work on PC graphics cards. The AI algorithm looks at each frame and adds detail that wasn’t there in the original render and makes the images sharper while keeping the frame rate high. This <strong>technology lets games render at 1440p or 1800p inside and output at 4K with clarity that rivals native 4K rendering</strong>. It also keeps the performance headroom needed for 60fps or higher refresh rates.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim already has great capabilities but advanced ray tracing hardware makes reflections, shadows, and lighting calculations twice as fast. Instead of flat or wrong screen-space approximations, realistic reflections in puddles, windows, and metal surfaces show up with the right depth and clarity. Ray-traced implementations that take into account complex geometry and light sources make shadows that act like real-world physics instead of the harsh, simplified shadows that traditional rasterization makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>console still has great DualSense controller support, fast SSD loading times, and 3D audio processing</strong> which were all things that made the original PS5 so impressive when it came out. Games still load in seconds instead of minutes, and the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers still give players a physical experience that sets PlayStation exclusives apart from games on other platforms.</p>
<p>The base models of the Slim have 1TB or 825GB of storage, <strong>while the base models of the Slim have 2TB</strong>. This is important because modern games often take up more than 100GB of space so here you can keep twice as many games without having to deal with external drives or constantly deleting old games to make room for new ones.</p>
<p>This $101 discount brings the price of premium PlayStation games closer to the price of the base console, but the performance is still worth the difference. You’re getting a machine that doesn’t make you choose between fidelity and performance, doubles your storage space, and makes sure your setup will work with future games that will push hardware harder.</p>

While Nintendo has shown off all three figures, we don't yet know when they're launching or how much each will cost, and none are available for preorder yet. We'll update this section once more information is announced.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection follows an all-new story and cast of characters, making it a great jumping-on point if you haven't played the first two games in the series. However, since we're still a few months out from the game's launch, now is a great time to check out the earlier entries if you're curious. The best way to grab them is with the Monster Hunter Stories Collection, which includes Monster Hunter Stories Remastered and Monster Hunter Stories II: Wings of Ruin in one package.

The Switch version of the game is playable on the Switch 2. Monster Hunter Stories Collection is also available digitally on PS4 and Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Stories 3 is a new RPG set in the world of Monster Hunter. Unlike the mainline series that's focused on repeatedly hunting the franchise's massive fauna, the Stories spinoffs are narrative-focused adventures that follow Monster Riders, a culture that lives in cooperation with the Monsters, rather than hunting them. Players capture and raise a roster of monsters, then team up with them in turn-based combat and use their special abilities to aid in exploring the vast overworld and dungeon-like monster dens. Monster Hunter Stories 3 changes up the formula with a new art style and a dual-protagonist focus, with the player's unnamed hero joining forces with Eleanor, the princess of a rival kingdom, to investigate an omen that could signal an oncoming calamity that threatens both characters' homelands. We got a chance to go hands-on with the game back in September, so be sure to check that out for more information on how the RPG is shaping up so far.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1260394277"

            <title><![CDATA[AMD Quietly Offloads Ryzen 9 9950X via Amazon, Now at All-Time Low Long After Black Friday Ended]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-quietly-offloads-ryzen-9-9950x-via-amazon-now-at-all-time-low-long-after-black-friday-ended-2000650568</link>
            <guid>1373878</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<strong> Ryzen 9 9950X is AMD’s best consumer processor</strong> and it has 16 cores and 32 threads which means it can handle both gaming and creative tasks at the same time. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">this chip is currently $529 on Amazon, which is $120 less than its normal price of $649 and this is the lowest price ever</a>, just a few days after Cyber Monday officially ended.</p>
<p>This processor changes everything for gamers who also stream, edit videos or run background apps while playing: It gets rid of the compromises that come with less powerful CPUs. The Zen 5 architecture can handle OBS encoding, Discord, Chrome tabs, and music streaming without breaking a sweat, and it can get frame rates over 100 FPS in demanding games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What 16 Cores Really Mean for Gaming</h2>
<p>Modern games increasingly use more CPU threads as developers optimize for console processors that pack 8 cores, which means high core count chips deliver better frame pacing and minimum FPS stability. The <strong>9950X handles game logic, AI calculations, and physics</strong> on some cores while dedicating others to background tasks that used to tank performance on 6-core or 8-core processors. This becomes crucial during intense multiplayer matches where you’re running anti-cheat software, voice chat, performance overlays, and possibly streaming software all at once.</p>



<p>The <strong>5.7 GHz max boost clock can reach the speeds that gaming workloads need</strong>, since most games still rely heavily on single-threaded performance even though they use multiple cores. AMD was able to reach these clock speeds by making changes to the architecture of Zen 5 that use less power and produce less heat than older generations. If you use a good cooling system and a motherboard that is made for overclocking, the unlocked multiplier lets you push frequencies even higher.</p>
<p>The 80 MB cache is made up of 64 MB of L3 cache and 16 MB of L2 cache: This makes a huge pool of memory on the chip that cuts down on how often the processor has to get data from slower system RAM. This cache hierarchy makes games with big open worlds or programs that work with huge datasets run much better because it keeps more information available at CPU speeds. The extra cache also speeds up the time it takes to compile code and assets that are used a lot, since they are kept close to the processing cores.</p>



<p>The<strong> fact that it supports DDR5-5600 memory means you can use the newest RAM technology </strong>which has more bandwidth than DDR4. However, the performance gains in gaming are not as big as they are in productivity workloads. The Socket AM5 platform supports <strong>PCIe 5.0 on motherboards</strong> that are compatible and this is most important right now for storage drives that can read at speeds of up to 14 GB/s: PCIe 5.0 has twice the bandwidth of previous versions, so future graphics cards will be able to use it.</p>
<p>This $120 discount makes flagship-level performance available at a price that competes with last-generation high-end chips, while also being much more efficient and powerful. You don’t have to make sacrifices or build separate systems for different tasks because this processor works well for both gaming and productivity. The value equation makes sense if you’re building a system meant to last 5-7 years through multiple GPU upgrades, since the CPU performance headroom ensures it won’t bottleneck future graphics cards or game engines.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-needs-to-hit-year-end-goals-goes-54-off-on-32-odyssey-curved-monitor-2000650598</link>
            <guid>1373854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not everyone needs a 57-inch ultrawide monitor costing $2,000 to get immersive gaming experiences that pull you into the action. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/">Samsung Odyssey G65B delivers serious performance at a record low of $369 instead of its usual $799</a>, and arrives post-Black Friday just in time for holiday shopping on Amazon. The 32-inch curved QHD display solves the problem of wanting competitive <strong>gaming features like 240Hz refresh and 1ms response</strong> without sacrificing visual quality or breaking the bank on extreme flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Specs Are Important When You Play</h2>
<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate updates the image 240 times per second</strong> which means that you see enemy movements, projectile trajectories, and changes in the environment four times faster than you would on a regular 60Hz display. In competitive shooters or fast-paced action games, being able to see an enemy 4ms sooner can mean the difference between getting the kill and losing it. When you add in the <strong>1ms gray-to-gray response time</strong>, the pixels change color so quickly that motion blur almost goes away, even when the camera pans quickly or the character moves quickly.</p>



<p>At 2560×1440, <strong>QHD resolution has 1.7 times more pixels than 1080p Full HD</strong> which makes text sharper, textures more detailed, and distant objects clearer without the performance hit that 4K needs. This resolution is perfect for gaming because it gives you much better picture quality while still keeping high frame rates on mid-range graphics cards. You can read small UI elements and see enemies from a distance without squinting. Also, games with complex environments show a lot more detail in character models, architecture, and foliage.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro matches the refresh rate of your monitor with the frame output of your graphics card: This stops screen tearing, which happens when the display shows parts of two different frames at the same time. This adaptive sync technology also takes care of low frame rate compensation. This means that even if your GPU drops below the monitor’s minimum refresh range, you still get smooth frame delivery without any stuttering.</p>



<p>The DisplayHDR 600 certification means that the monitor can reach a peak brightness of 600 nits in HDR content which makes highlights stand out against darker backgrounds instead of the washed-out look that cheaper HDR monitors give. The wider range of contrast makes it easier to see enemies hiding in the dark or bright corners where standard dynamic range makes details look like pure black or white. Games that support HDR have more realistic lighting. For example, the sun glare feels strong, the fire glows in a way that makes sense, and you can still see things in the dark.</p>
<p>The 1000R curvature has a <strong>radius of 1000mm which matches the natural curve of human vision</strong>: This makes the edges of the screen feel closer to your eyes than flat displays. This gentle curve makes the distance between the center and edges of the screen less variable, which keeps the image quality the same across the whole panel.</p>
<p>This 54% off makes a high-end gaming monitor an affordable upgrade that costs less than what mid-range options usually cost. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to upgrade your display, this is a great deal.</p>

      <p>I don't know if I've laughed more at a headline this year than when I sat down with a coffee this morning and saw "Meta Plans to Shift Spending Away From the Metaverse".</p><p>It's from a<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-plans-to-shift-spending-away-from-the-metaverse-d0ac3b7f?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Wall Street Journal story</u></a>, which reports that Meta is going to make some big budget changes in 2026, slashing spending on its metaverse efforts and redirecting that cash towards the company's AI and AI-powered wearable divisions instead.</p><p>In 2021, just four years ago, Zuckerberg was so into the idea of the metaverse that <em>he changed his company's name</em> from Facebook, one of the most recognisable brands on the planet, to Meta. He said within the next decade--so by 2031--<em>one billion people</em> would be hanging out in these virtual spaces, which were a key selling point for Quest headsets.</p><figure><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-29/facebook-rebrands-as-meta-to-harness-virtual-reality-in-future/100578908?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Facebook rebrands as Meta as it chases ‘metaverse’ vision</p><p>Facebook chief executive&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg says his company is rebranding itself as Meta in an effort to encompass its virtual-reality vision for the future.</p><p><span>ABC News</span></p></div></a></figure><p>And investors and shareholders believed him! He said something that had no basis in reality, which was never going to happen and--surprise--has not happened, and sunk billions of dollars into a quixotic quest. Now he's stuck with a company named after something he's making a humiliating retreat from.</p><p>In 2022, he was so into the idea of NFTs that<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-confirms-nf-ts-are-coming-to-instagram-204435805.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>he spoke openly</u></a> about a vision that one day soon users of his metaverse would be able to buy clothing items as NFTs, and announced plans to bring them to both Facebook and Instagram. This received widespread news coverage!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-never-turned-off-black-friday-deal-on-galaxy-tab-s10-still-selling-at-all-time-low-price-2000650535</link>
            <guid>1373839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S10+</strong> competes directly with iPad Pro models in the premium tablet space, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6216/">the 256GB model still available at the Black Friday record low of $749 instead of $999</a> because Amazon and Samsung haven’t pulled the deal yet. This is the <strong>best value for money you’ll find on a premium Android tablet right now</strong>, especially considering the included S Pen and Galaxy AI features that cost extra on competing devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Galaxy AI Changes the Way You Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>AMOLED 2X display technology</strong> makes blacks darker and colors brighter than standard LCD panels. It also has brightness levels that can be seen in direct sunlight. The <strong>12.4-inch size</strong> gives you enough screen space to do two things at once or do detailed creative work without making it hard to hold or carry. The display <strong>supports a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, which makes scrolling smooth and S Pen input quick, getting rid of the lag that makes cheaper stylus systems feel like they’re not connected to your hand movements. The colors are accurate enough for professional photo editing and design work, but you should still check the final output on calibrated displays before you publish it.</p>



<p>The <strong>S Pen that comes with the tablet attaches to the edge</strong> of the tablet with magnets and charges wirelessly when it is docked whch means you never have to worry about running out of battery or losing the stylus. The pen pressure sensitivity can tell the difference between more than 4,000 levels of force which lets you use shading techniques and line weight changes that are like those of traditional drawing tools. Palm rejection works well enough that you can write on the screen without accidentally touching it when you rest your hand on it. The pen latency stays low enough that the digital ink keeps up with your strokes in real time instead of having to catch up.</p>
<p>The <em>Sketch to Image</em> feature uses AI processing to figure out what you want and add detail, shading, and style to your rough drawings to make them look like finished works of art. This is very helpful for designers who want to quickly see how their ideas will look or for students who need to make graphics for a presentation without spending hours in complicated design software. You draw something simple with the <strong>S Pen, choose the AI enhancement option</strong>, and the tablet makes several improved versions based on what you drew. For most tasks, the processing happens on the device, so your notes and sketches don’t get sent to cloud servers for AI analysis.</p>



<p>With <em>Circle to Search</em> with Google, you can draw a circle around anything on the screen to highlight it and start a search right away without having to switch apps or copy text. This works perfectly when you’re reading articles, watching videos, or scrolling through social media and see something that makes you want to learn more. The feature can read text, pictures, and even things in pictures which makes research and fact-checking go more smoothly without having to switch between apps and search for things by hand.</p>



<p>The <strong>battery lasts for full workdays</strong> with a mix of activities like taking notes, making video calls, browsing the web, and streaming media. It usually lasts 10 to 12 hours before needing to be charged. The aluminum body feels high-end and is light enough to be used for long periods of time without feeling heavy. The build quality is strong enough to handle being carried around in bags every day without feeling fragile.</p>
<p>This $250 discount makes high-end Android tablets compete with mid-range iPad Pros. The value proposition is based on having professional-grade hardware and software tools that make you more productive and creative instead of just passively consuming content.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-liquidates-this-1tb-15-laptop-at-77-off-zero-profit-play-to-dump-year-end-inventory-2000650606</link>
            <guid>1373818</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Year-end hardware shopping delivers the best deals as manufacturers clear remaining inventory to hit annual sales targets before closing the books. This L<strong>enovo V15 G2 laptop</strong> is<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6219/"> currently at a record low of $599 instead of its typical $2,599 listing, available exclusively through Amazon’s stock</a> rather than Lenovo’s official site.</p>
<p>The configuration packs <strong>32GB DDR4 RAM, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and a 15.6-inch FHD display</strong> into a practical business and student laptop that handles everyday computing without breaking your budget. Over <strong>1,000 reviews average 4.5 stars</strong> as buyers discover this is solid value for general productivity work, web browsing, and multitasking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Setup Works for Daily Work</h2>
<p>The 32GB of RAM is a lot for a budget laptop, which is unusual and it lets you keep dozens of browser tabs open along with Office apps, video conferencing software, and background programs without slowing down. Most cheap laptops come with 8GB or 16GB of RAM which means you have to close programs all the time or deal with lag when you switch between tasks.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for document libraries, photo collections, downloaded media, and application installations without needing external drives or constant cloud management. The PCIe interface makes load times faster than older SATA SSDs which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps open right away instead of making you wait. The amount of space on the drive is important, especially for students who need to keep their textbooks, lecture recordings, and project files on their own computers, or for business users who need to keep client documents and presentations offline.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD screen has a resolution of 1920x1080px and makes text look clear enough for long periods of time without straining your eyes. The anti-glare coating also cuts down on reflections from windows or lights above you and the screen quality is good enough for work and media consumption – but it doesn’t pretend to be a display for making content with perfect color accuracy.<strong> Dolby Audio speakers make video calls sound clear</strong> and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.</p>



<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 support</strong> means faster wireless speeds and better performance in networks that are crowded with many devices trying to use the same bandwidth. The connectivity options cover practical needs: <strong>USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories and possible display output, HDMI ports for external monitors or projectors, and an Ethernet jack</strong> for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or isn’t reliable enough.</p>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 processor</strong> does a good job of handling basic computing tasks and uses very little power, which is good for battery life during classes or meetings when there aren’t any outlets nearby. This chip isn’t good for video editing, 3D rendering, or gaming beyond simple games, but it works fine for web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and communication software.</p>
<p>This $2,000 discount off the normal listing price makes a well-equipped laptop affordable while keeping specs that usually cost $1,000 to $1,200 elsewhere. You get twice as much RAM and storage as most other budget laptops, as well as modern connectivity standards that make the laptop last longer.</p>

            <guid>1373815</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's housing feature launched this week for everyone who purchased the upcoming Midnight expansion early. Though the feature is still in its early stages, players (including yours truly) are already losing hours upon hours creating elaborate homes with the decor available. But Horde players in particular are really struggling to contend with one major issue: their house exteriors are ugly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, that's a little mean. If you play an orc, or are into the orc aesthetics of spikes, flames, haphazard metal plates, and slapdash wooden boards nailed on, the Horde exteriors are fine. The issue is that a lot of the Horde - namely, everyone who doesn't play an orc - generally prefers a less...grungey aesthetic. Alliance players also only get one exterior housing option, but their homes are fairly standard, inoffensive cottages that most people will find tolerable at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for anyone unhappy with what's on offer, until Midnight fully launches, this is it. You can customize your exterior in various ways by changing up roof colors and chimney styles, but it's all in your faction's default aesthetic. Blizzard has <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-is-launching-their-own-dps-meters-and-improving-nameplates-in-midnight-378291" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised that Night Elf and Blood Elf exteriors will arrive on Midnight's release</a>, with more options planned for later on. But for now you're stuck with either a cottage or a spike shack one way or another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players, like myself, are just trying to make the best of it with outdoor decorations. Here's my modest hut. You'd never know that inside is a cozy Shaman retreat, complete with a small magical library, a snug kitchen, and a stone altar dedicated in honor of the elements.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/wowscrnshot-120425-150753-1764885571991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Home sweet orc shack.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But a lot of players are getting far, far more creative in their attempts to subvert the shabby exterior design. You see, Blizzard's decoration tools are very, very precise if you want them to be, and can ignore collision if you want them to. Which has led to Horde players trying to mask the orc-ness of their huts by covering them with...well, all sorts of other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, this person turned their house into a nice cave:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person took a crack at a more Blood Elf-looking style:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person made something simple yet effective:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="660" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pdmsmr/i_reject_the_horde_mudhuts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wow</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this one is pretty cool:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in doing this, one issue players are running up against is that there <em>is </em>a limit to how much decor you can put outside, and many of the objects people are using to cover up the orc turrets use up a significant portion of that limit. As a result, if you want to cover your house in rocks, you can't do much else with your yard. It seems like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe6ddu/blizz_please_increase_the_outdooor_decor_cap_ive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone is begging Blizzard</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe0qfn/exterior_decor_limit_takes_away_a_lot_of_fun_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise the exterior decor cap</a>, an issue they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">told us they're well aware of and working on</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, this is not a massive issue at the moment: we knew going in that this was effectively an early access feature and some functionality would be limited. More than anything, it's funny to see the lengths players will go to in order to get creative with the tools they have available to them. Just imagine what they'll be capable of once they don't have to waste all their outdoor decor space on big wooden platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft: Midnight <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-expansion-release-date-confirmed">launches on March 2, 2026</a>. If you want to get your hands on housing before then, you've got to pre-order the expansion - any version of it will do. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">recently spoke with</a> Jesse Kurlancheek, housing lead and principal game designer, and Joanna Giannullis, senior UX designer, about the housing feature, including how its gone in the beta so far, and what to expect in Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for</link>
            <guid>1373809</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bask in the sun… and risk getting the meanest sunburn of your life. Hello Sunshine is an impressive step up from the usual post-apocalypse survival RPG formula, playing with some clever ideas around scorching sunlight, blissful shade, and the cycle of day and night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I previewed a hands-off, pre-alpha slice of Hello Sunshine’s story-driven, single-player campaign with the developers at Red Thread Games, many of whom are veteran developers in the narrative gaming world (think Dreamfall, The Longest Journey, and The Secret World). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is looking extremely polished for something built by just seven people, and puts a cool twist on what “suspense” means in the genre. From the extreme, sizzling heat of day to uncovering lore during frigid nights – here is why I believe Hello Sunshine’s future is looking bright.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Coming in hot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels – a skeleton in a folding camping chair, still clutching a drink as if the world ended mid-sip. Pressing the start button, the player character stumbles past, immediately launching you into this weird wasteland world. It wasn’t clear to me whether she was a preset character or customizable, but (in this preview, at least) she appeared to be the silent type.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In this cruel and scorching desert, it’s clear that she is already suffering from the early symptoms of heatstroke, and she’s also very sad about finding a water bottle that turns out to be empty. This scene is the introduction to Hello Sunshine’s heat and thirst mechanics – a delicate balancing act of avoiding collapse from dehydration or slow-cooking in the harsh sunlight. Robots aside, the sun is essentially your biggest enemy (but with ray tracing).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ruined buildings yield water and other supplies that help you maintain a survivable body temperature, but shadows also play a huge role. If you’re roasting, resting in shade can keep your temperature down. And almost immediately, you’ll meet the most interesting shadow dynamic of all – Hello Sunshine’s other “main character,” who is a skyscraper-sized robot that seems to have a clearer idea of where it’s going than you do.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Chasing shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This metallic gentle giant is, like you, wandering through these badlands. It kind of ignores you in the beginning, but you’ll be grateful for the enormous shadow it casts as it moves, shielding you from UV-based harm as you follow it along sand dunes and amongst rusted shipping containers. And no, it won’t wait patiently for you if you saunter off; you’ll need to keep up with its pace if you don’t want to end up dying humiliatingly of sunburn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is survival through solar instinct and (coining an ahem hot new term here) shade management, not health bars alone – creating an urgency that adds an unconventional form of suspense to your strange journey.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hello Sunshine Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The landscape, of course, hides precious resources – but you’ll need to strategize and carefully time your brief detours from the robot’s shadow. Spend too much time dilly-dallying and the robot may move too far ahead, meaning you won’t make it back before your heat meter runs out. The sun’s path, from afternoon to sunset, was particularly brilliant – with shadows lengthening or shrinking as the day progresses, you’ll need to adapt your decisions about how far you wander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can expect that you’ll find more awesome loot the farther you stray, of course. No word yet on whether loot will be randomized each playthrough, but I’m hoping that will be the case. Whatever ingredients you’re able to grab could limit what you’re able to craft – and add further challenge, based on what gear you’re able to make and how that may limit your desired playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bringin’ on the heat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunbeams, however; Hello Sunshine does include combat, which you can shape according to your desired playstyle. Being noisy and aggressively guns-out (or, more accurately, bows-out), for instance, will probably attract even more enemies – and more scavengeable loot from their remains.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-robot-sunhi-2-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you can go for more defensive options, potentially even avoiding head-on conflict. I didn’t really get a sense of what a stealthier playthrough might look like, but I’m hoping the confrontational-to-avoidant spectrum is wide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your enemies, by the way, are more robots – definitely angrier than your giant friend – and they curiously seem to have taken on forms of the fleshy species that I assume were otherwise wiped out during the apocalypse. A little metal jackal will snap at your heels, for example, or a hulking robot crab may try to skewer you with its giant claw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character’s bow is one of the primary weapons. At first, it doesn’t look like much – kind of pitiful against giant armored bots, really – but you’ll be able to upgrade it throughout the game and craft better ammo for it, such as explosive arrows.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-footsteps-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Little events occur here and there to keep your journey interesting – like a distant airdrop of unspecified items, or a sandstorm that gives you brief respite from the sun but also reduces visibility, making it easier for you to lose your robot friend. Many of these events are procedural, hopefully unlocking varied experiences with subsequent playthroughs.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Befriending the sleeping giant</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Conveniently, your enormous robot companion has a circadian rhythm: once the sun sets, it will take a break to recharge. In the preview, this happened at the remains of a Sunshine service station – owned by the ominous corporation whose shareholders, presumably, voted to min-max the humanity-destruction budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The service station is basically your inexplicably cheerful crafting workshop, complete with happy tinkling music. You can take a breather here, check out your loot from the day, “recycle” unwanted items, and use the parts to 3D-print new gear – from health packs to flashlights or even new shoes. You can also mend the wear-and-tear wrought on your gear throughout the day. Did you rip up your pants sliding down dunes butt-first? Repair ‘em here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-nomad-robot-meet-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine building also acts as a robot maintenance site, allowing you to make repairs or upgrade the big guy. As I mentioned previously, it pretty much ignores you in the early stages – but if you impress it enough with your ongoing care, it may begin to care about you too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t want to stray far at night, though, as it gets chilly. The preview didn’t demonstrate any “night runs,” but that’s apparently something you’ll be able to do, which could be a nice (or fraught) accompaniment to the day journeys – no word on how optional these runs may be, or whether they’ll offer different rewards (or even plot developments).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the story unfolds during these night sequences; start a campfire and strangers just may show up. The preview didn’t show interactions with any of these strangers, but they may or may not be very nice people. Regardless of whether they turn out to be friends or meanies, they will unveil parts of the Sunshine corporation’s mysterious origins.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In short: shade wins</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-sitting-hand-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine rest stop was where our preview ended – though we were told that the player would progress through different biomes over the following in-game days. Since I only saw the desert area, the wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I only saw part of the single-player campaign, there will also be co-op (split-screen and online); buddy up, and you will both experience a reframed version of the story. It’s recommended you do this after the main campaign so you can get the full story behind whatever the heck is going on in this world. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is the studio’s first foray into both the RPG and survival genres, so will their narrative pedigree see it through? I like their chances based on what I’ve seen so far. Everyone loves a good “evil corporation” story, and I honestly still can’t get over how cool those dawn-to-dusk shadow mechanics are (I can imagine other game designers thinking, “Damn, why didn’t I think of that?!”). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your overall question about Hello Sunshine is “Does it look good?” then yes, it is very promising. And if it’s “Will I melt to death holding a handmade bow?” the answer is still yes – but enthusiastically.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for]]></content:encoded>

It will be available as a free-to-play game across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes following the launch and "unlaunch" of Splitgate 2 earlier this year. Splitgate 2 released in June to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">controversy</a>, and a rapid drop-off of players as criticism of the game grew. In response, 1047 "unlaunched" Splitgate 2, announcing in July it would temporarily wind down support for it while the team worked on a new version of the game with "big, sweeping changes."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown">spoke to CEO Ian Proulx at the time</a>. During our conversation, he explained that Splitgate 2 as it was at launch was "not a finished product yet," and that fans were clamoring for a game that was closer to Splitgate 1. At the time, he assured the team would be focused on updating the game in accordance with player feedback, including adding "basic features" like a leaderboard and better progression, more portal walls, and adjustments to game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx also said he wanted to make the season pass and monetization in general less confusing while keeping the game free-to-play. At the time, Proulx projected the update would take place in early 2026, so this December release is sooner than expected.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded Relaunch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what, then, is Splitgate: Arena Reloaded? According to a press release, it "reimagines everything from core combat to UI." Here's an overview provided by 1047 of the major updates:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Removed Factions, Abilities, and select equipment to refocus on classic arena combat</em></li><li><em>Rebuilt progression from the ground up and overhauled the Ranked system</em></li><li><em>Introduced 5 new, and 6 fully-reworked maps, 3 new Primary Weapons and 1 new Power Weapon: the Railgun</em></li><li><em>New Arena modes, playlist selection, and a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and powerups</em></li><li><em>Reduced store prices, simplified the Battle Pass, and improved overall cosmetic quality</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">An accompanying video featuring former Rocket League game director and current 1047 design director Josh Watson also notes that Arena Reloaded includes the addition of player stats, leaderboards, and a career system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We initially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-review">gave Splitgate 2 at launch a 7/10</a>, calling it "a decent successor to the original that expands on it, but never really surpasses it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA['We Didn't Really Care About Balance' — How the Developers of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 Made Primarch Lion El'Jonson Playable In-Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/we-didnt-really-care-about-balance-how-the-developers-of-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-made-primarch-lion-eljonson-playable-in-game</link>
            <guid>1373800</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time ever, a Primarch is playable in a Warhammer 40,000 video game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dawn-of-war-4-has-something-no-other-warhammer-40000-video-game-has-ever-had-a-playable-primarch">Lion El'Jonson — aka The Lion — is playable in upcoming real-time strategy game Dawn of War 4</a>. It’s a hugely exciting prospect for fans of the setting, who have so far had to imagine what it would be like to play as a Primarch in a video game. Now, we’ll get to control The Lion himself, the reborn leader of the Dark Angels chapter of Space Marines, as he presumably swats away all before him with the Emperor’s Shield and Fealty. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did developer King Art Games convince Games Workshop to let them do what no other developer has done before? And how did it approach making the seriously overpowered Lion El'Jonson work in Dawn of War 4? What does his inclusion mean for Dawn of War 4’s potential canon status within the setting? And will we get to see his face?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with director Jan Theysen to ask these questions and many more. We get into some serious detail about The Lion, the Dark Angels, and where we’re at in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, so sit down, relax, and trust in the Emperor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I think the first obvious question is why did you choose the Dark Angels as the second playable faction for the Space Marines?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> When we talked about, okay, what are the factions we want in the game, it's obvious that you need the Blood Ravens, right? It's a Dawn of War. And we talked about the other factions and then at some point it came up, okay, why just have the Blood Ravens? Maybe there is an option to also have another faction or another chapter. And basically Games Workshop said, ‘Hey, why not Dark Angels, could be a cool pick?’ And we said, ‘Oh, okay, of course, why not? Cool pick.’ And then they said, ‘Okay, what about… do you want Lion El'Jonson?’ And we were like, ‘Oh, okay, cool idea.’ That's basically it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Games Workshop suggested Dark Angels to you guys? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Yeah, basically they said, ‘Hey, just because it's a Dawn of War doesn't mean that it can be only Blood Ravens, right? There could be other Space Marines in there as well. And this was basically, okay then let's talk about it. What are the options and what could be a cool addition? And we took it from there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There'll be a system where you'll be able to choose between playing as the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels and you pick the missions you want to play. How will that work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> As you might know, we have four different campaigns in the game and for all of the campaigns we try to figure out something that gives the players some choices or some things they can do and influence in the campaign. And so for example, in the Ork campaign, you can literally pick, okay, do you want to play these Orks or these Orks and they're fighting each other. And so that's a very clear distinction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Space Marines, of course that doesn’t make sense, right? They're not really different goals or anything, they're not fighting each other, but they're working on the same thing. And so we basically said, okay, what we can do is we can offer different gameplay experiences based on the factions, because story-wise, the Dark Angels, they have all the toys and all the power and they can basically do the big battles and the epic conflicts, while the Blood Ravens are… they have bigger problems and they need to rely on smaller operations, behind enemy lines, a little bit more covert operations maybe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so basically how this works is we have this Space Marine campaign story and there are different things happening at the same time. The Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels, sometimes they are at the same place at the same time and then you can play both of them. But other times it's like, okay, Dark Angels do this now, Blood Ravens do this now, who do we want to play? And then you can basically pick, hey, I want the big all out war battle or I want to play this more tactical thing maybe with the Blood Ravens. And then you can pick and then at some point they meet again, or the things converge again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So you don’t change the story outcome?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> The story remains the same, but the question is which parts of the story you encounter or you play with because the other stuff still happens, but then you only hear from it if you're not a part of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do the Dark Angels have different units at their disposal? Are the gameplay mechanics different? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In general it's all Space Marines, right? The faction is Space Marines, but storywise in the campaign, the Blood Ravens don't have access to all the toys and to the big armies and so on. So their missions will be more infantry heavy and also a little bit smaller. And there is even here and there something that is more in the stealth or something that leads you to play a little bit more careful maybe, while the Dark Angles is more like okay, the big battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But they have the same units in multiplayer. In multiplayer for example, if you play the Blood Ravens, you have all the same toys because that's a separate thing. Where they differ is with the heroes. So both of the factions have two playable heroes, except for Lion El'Jonson, who is in the campaign but not really like a playable hero. So they both have two. And that of course leads to different things you can do, but also a little bit different playstyles maybe. So depending on the hero you pick, if you really are into slow progress and powerful defensive units, then you might pick the Terminator captain. And if you are more about quick stealthy stuff, you might pick Cyrus. There they can differ a little bit in terms of gameplay. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-chief-librarian-jonah-orion-1764858391841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Chief Librarian Jonah Orion.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Let's talk about The Lion. We've never had a playable Primarch in a Warhammer 40,000 video game before. Why are you allowed to do this when no other developer has been allowed to do this? How did this come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> When we talked about the Darker Angels we talked about options, what can we do? And this came up, and it was like, we were just basically asking is that an option or not? Just because let's make sure that we talked about everything. And they said, well yeah, maybe? Tell us what you would like to do with him and then we can tell you if this is an option or not. He's just so off the curve in terms of power level that of course you can't really have him as a normal unit in the game or something you can use in multiplayer or something like that. And so we basically said, okay, we don't want to make this all about The Lion and the whole campaign revolves around him or something, because he is again, so off the curve for that, it wouldn't really… I mean, how can we represent him in a correct way that doesn't mess up your whole game and balancing and everything? And so we basically said, okay, it would be really fun, it would be really cool to have him in the game, and it's a big honor to have him here, but let's just have it as a guest appearance. And so in the game there are two cutscenes and one mission where the Lion plays a role, and you can play him and he is fun and he is off the charts, but he is not available for the rest of the game because he’s just too powerful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So you came up with a way this would work and convinced Games Workshop?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean I don't think we really had to convince them in terms of, they didn't want to do it or something. It was more like, okay, it obviously would be a cool thing for players to have it in the game, but let's make sure we get it right. And so if we have the Lion in the game, okay, how would he play? What happens? Is he one-shotting everything and how is this interesting? And so we came up with this idea that — without spoiling anything — it's basically the Dark Angels and the Blood Ravens did everything they could to stop the bad thing from happening, and then at the very end there is just something they can't overcome. And that is a big entrance for the Lion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The power sets of the Primarchs are one of the most debated aspects of 40K lore. Fans love pitting the Primarchs against each other and speculating about who would win in a fight. Part of what you're doing here is unmasking a Primarch in a way, and revealing how that might work in a way that we've never seen before. We’re finally getting to see their power set in action.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In an RTS you try to give all the units that are in the game a certain character that fits the description and that works in terms of lore. But on the other hand, it's also of course an RTS game and you have to make sure that it's balanced, and that the players can understand actually, for example, what is this unit good against? And that is of course a problem if all the units are good against everything. We dealt with that for the whole production to basically figure out how can we make sure that all the factions feel authentic and the units feel authentic and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For The Lion, it's a little bit of a special case because it's like the last mission in the game and it's more about, okay, let's have a cool cinematic thing going on here and then it's about having fun with a Primarch, and we didn't really care about if this is balanced or this is something that you can actually could theoretically do in multiplayer, something like that. Who cares, right? This is just to have fun. And if we would ever put Lion El'Jonson in any other mode, he could definitely not be the same unit that he is in the campaign.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-ezrael-1764858408388.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Dark Angels have their own playable Commanders for the Space Marines, including Chaplain Ezrael.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did you think about keeping this under wraps so players could discover it for themselves at the end of the campaign? You are going out now before the game comes out and you're actually talking about it. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean that's always the question, right? Do you want the big surprise for the game or, to be honest, want to use it in marketing? And I think that the point is that in today's landscape it's basically impossible to keep it under wraps. Maybe for a handful of players it would've been mind blowing and really cool and I get that. And of course if you could make sure that this is the case for a lot of players, then we probably would've done it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in reality it probably takes a couple of minutes and you have screenshots of that or a video on TikTok and then that was it. And so for us it was basically, okay, if we talk about the Dark Angels — because that is another thing. Theoretically, we could also maybe have tried to just keep the whole Dark Angels thing under wraps, but again, it's very hard to keep it secret. And then within minutes someone gets a post out and that was it. And so we basically said, okay, it's probably not worth it and let's make sure we all have fun with it early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And you sort of spoiled it yourselves. Did you see fans spotted a The Lion file name in a video? Was that intentional?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> It was not. We didn't check the file name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I would love to talk to you about canon. So have you spoken with GW about if Dawn of War is canon? If The Lion is in the game, I'm assuming it's set after The Lion’s return because what we're seeing here, the model that I've seen in the trailer is the new model. So what have your discussions been like there? Space Marine 2 is canon, and Titus is obviously a massive part of the ongoing narrative. So how do you fit in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Actually, I don’t know if there's an official decision for that, and that’s probably something that Games Workshop has to decide in the end. But we know where it takes place in terms of location and time. It would fit into everything else. But I'm not sure if Games Workshop says, okay, this is canon now or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, picking Kronus as the planet the game takes place on. It was more like, okay, we need a planet. Do we invent something new? And basically the question was, well, we could also go back to Kronus and it might be fun to tell a little bit about what happened to the planet and who won the Dark Crusade and all of that. And so why not? And then basically we figured out, okay, where is Kronus? Which side of the Great Rift is it on? And so on. And so you slowly develop how could all of this fit together? But again, if it's now official canon or not, I think that is a question for Games Workshop.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-terminators-1764858453541.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dark Angels Terminators deep strike into Dawn of War 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So is Kronus in the Imperium Nihilus then? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Yeah, it's on the other side of the Rift.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Which would explain why the Dark Angels and Lion El'Jonson are able to be there at this point in time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Well, it also explains maybe a little bit why the Blood Ravens are struggling, right? Because it's basically that chapter is kind of all over the place, but the guys we are dealing with, they found themselves in Nihilus as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Following that then, are we setting up some sort of relationship between the Dark Angels and the Blood Ravens here that fans will get a kick out of in terms of successor chapters? Or are people reading too much into the idea that they're working together? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I think that's maybe a little bit too much. I mean obviously we make sure that we represent the chapters and they're both Space Marines, but that doesn't mean that they necessarily trust each other or that they are great friends. But at least for us, it's not a big future thing that now for example, Blood Ravens and Dark Angels are, I dunno… they won't be in a buddy movie anytime soon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The Blood Ravens are canon, right? They were made part of the canon by Games Workshop. And obviously Dark Angels are. So I think questions like that will be inevitable from fans. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> It's true, but it's also, I mean especially when it comes to the Blood Ravens, it's a relatively small group that basically exists on this planet they use as a recruiting world. It's not like this is now the only thing. There might be other Blood Ravens out there, we don't know. And there are certainly other Dark Angels out there. So it's not like we are writing the history of these chapters now or something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If The Lion is in the game, are we talking about the Fallen here in terms of the Dark Angels?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In general we don't really want story spoilers of course, but I think in this case it's not a part of the story really. There's an immediate threat and it's something that has to be dealt with quickly. And so we are really about that story and not too much about the backstory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: We’ve seen the Lion wear his helmet. Does he have voice acting? Does he have lines of dialogue? Do we see his face?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> What you see in the trailer is part of the two cutscenes that we have with him, and he definitely starts out without the helmet, just to make sure that everybody understands who it is. And also of course he has lines, a little bit in the cutscenes, but also you can play him. And so obviously being an RTS, he acknowledges if he is supposed to kill someone, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So we'll finally get to hear him speak! You know what modders are going to do when the game comes out, right? They're going to take The Lion and put him in multiplayer or skirmish or whatever it is. You must be predicting that. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean officially I probably have to say that you can't mod anything, but I can see people doing that and also having fun with it, so why not? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'd love to get an insight into what it’s like working with Games Workshop when it comes to big lore stuff like this.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Without going into the details, we have a group of people on the Games Workshop side working with us, and we use them as this encyclopedia of Warhammer knowledge. So whenever we need something, we kind of need an ability or a weapon that does kind of this, is there something? And then they go away and come back and give us options on what we could use. And that is the main thing, because it's so complex and there is so much stuff. And even if you have someone like John French writing the story, he knows a lot of stuff, but even he maybe doesn't know all the little details for all the different factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If something is just not correct, then of course they also come back with feedback about that. But for us I think it's fine because in the end what we try to do is to be as authentic as possible. In the past, we all know that there were games that maybe some units and so on didn't feel like maybe they should feel and so on. And we basically said, okay, let's make sure we get this right. And Games Workshop was helping out with that a lot. Let's make sure we get it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 is scheduled for release in 2026 on PC via Steam.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

    <div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > CRITICAL REFLEX [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/critical-reflex">CRITICAL REFLEX</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Hey Bird!" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hey-bird">Hey Bird!</a> have announced occult detective <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,755 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Inkblood" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/inkblood">Inkblood</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4114100/Inkblood/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1011703"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via CRITICAL REFLEX:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>You’re an Inquisitor following a trail of death. A cult is at work, your predecessor has vanished, and the region teeters on the edge of chaos. Find the truth. Uphold the Inquisition. Do not fail.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Uncover the Truth</strong> – You are uniquely equipped to solve this mystery. Besides your wit, keen eye, and intuition, your carriage provides you with some more… advanced tools. Inspect the clues, take photos of everything important, compile a case file and dial your overseer once you have a strong theory.</li><li><strong>Explore the Land</strong> – Don’t expect to find everything in one place. The investigation will surely have you riding back and forth in some bizarre, perhaps even unsettling locations. Just tap the map on the coachman’s back to choose your next stop, whether it’s the city of Inqburg, deadly swamps, abandoned villages, or rite sites.</li><li><strong>Dwell Into the Past</strong> – You are equipped with a magnifying glass, which allows you to peek into the past. Use it: nothing is certain in the present until the past is untangled. Wonder what the villagers were up to last night? Peek into that fragment of the past through their windows!</li><li><strong>Eradicate the Occult</strong> – It is nothing short of foolish to assume one case has no relation to another. In your position, you’re expected to see the big picture – no detail is insignificant, and sometimes a small clue from an old case might lead to the greatest of revelations.</li><li><strong>(Don’t) Tamper With Your Carriage</strong> – Your carriage is your home, as well as your prison. Its compartments may be of help in your search, though some of them are not to be opened. Be careful with it, don’t tamper with things you don’t understand. Remember – the Inquisition always learns the truth.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>After some very public missteps and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/" data-ref-id="1100-6533350">unprecedented return to beta</a>, Splitgate is hoping to make a comeback under a new name. At the PC Games Show, 1047 Games announced that Splitgate 2 will return as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, with massive gameplay and progression changes that aim to bring the shooter closer to its roots.</p><p>According to 1047 Games design director Josh Watson, the studio has been rebuilding the game "from the ground up," incorporating and refining the best elements from both Splitgate games while "removing what didn't work." In a video announcement, Watson specifically cited Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Halo as the main inspirations for Splitgate.</p><p>To that end, the rebooted Splitgate will lack the Factions and Abilities introduced in Splitgate 2 for a more "classic arena combat" experience. Arena Reloaded also contains retooled progression and ranked systems, along with reduced in-game store prices; Splitgate 2's microtransactions were a major pain point with players when the game first launched.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrcUZ_F7vX8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Splitgate: Arena Unloaded adds five new maps, six "fully reworked" maps, three new Primary Weapons, and a Railgun power weapon. 1047 Games emphasizes that all the new additions are based on community feedback through public playtesting.</p><p>1047 Games announced last month that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-beta-finally-ending-as-full-launch-nears-in-december/1100-6536502/" data-ref-id="1100-6536502">Splitgate 2 beta ends on December 4</a>, with the game going offline afterward before its relaunch. As with Splitgate 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will be free-to-play on PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Splitgate 2 first launched in open beta form in May before a full release in June. After a public controversy in which 1047 Games wore a "Make FPS Great Again" hat at Summer Game Fest, along with microtransaction complaints and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">developer layoffs</a>, the game reverted back to beta in July.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Cellar Door Games, the creators of Rogue Legacy 1 and 2, have revealed a substantially different new game called Neath during today’s PC Gaming Show. It’s a dark roguelike tactical RPG coming next year.</p><p>Neath is set in a dying world that has an irradiated, inverted tower looming above it. Players lead a band of fragile warriors up the tower, which holds Taboos, a series of ever-changing edicts from a god that regularly alter the laws of reality.</p><p>Inspired by games like Into the Breach and tabletop games like Mansions of Madness, the grid-based game features what a press release calls a “fluid turn-based system where the turn order is always shifting.” In other words, Neath allows players to control the actions of allies and enemies alike.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>An “engagement-locking” system grips allied units in fear when targeted by foes. It’s up to the player to disrupt enemies. The game’s press release also states that players can “Make trapped chests fizzle, barter with the gods, and reshape destiny with the power of Fate's Die. Encounter special events inspired by classic 90's dungeon-crawlers that reshapes your party during every run. But beware the consequences when playing games with providence.”</p><p>Throughout each run through the tower, players will build their party and learn new abilities, and find powerful relics. Players can discover team synergies to help turn the tide of battles. Outside of tower runs, players will rebuild the small town of Shale into a rich settlement that, in turn, will help them better prepare for future runs.</p><p>Neath will launch in 2026 for PC via Steam. Until then, you can read our reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rogue_legacy/b/pc/archive/2013/07/16/rogue-legacy-review.aspx">Rogue Legacy</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/rogue-legacy-2/generations-of-greatness">Rogue Legacy 2</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/control-your-enemies-and-fate-in-neath-a-roguelike-strategy-game-by-the-creators-of]]></content:encoded>
