            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Spiders and publisher Nacon have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's not too far off at all.</p>
<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/4245287299554888114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update on Steam</a> and a release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. As a reminder, this is the release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect">the Early Access build of the game</a> rather than a full launch.</p>
<p>Prior to the Early Access launch, you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer dropping in August, followed by the reveal of the game's updated roadmap in September.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-release-date-city.jpg?itok=U0XXIGVs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-release-date-city.jpg?itok=W_v9hZGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>For&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>, Nacon and Spiders are promising an "even deeper" RPG experience than the first game offered, complete with new lands to explore, new alliances to forge, and more.</p>
<p><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>will serve as a prequel to the original game; it takes place around three years before the adventures of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em>'s hero De Sardet, and you'll play as a native of the island of Teer Fradee, uprooted from your home and forced into a conflict that could decide the fate of the continent at large.</p>
<p>As you'll probably expect if you played the first game,&nbsp;you'll be able to recruit party members, help them out with their personal problems, and even romance them, not to mention being able to control them in combat.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to meeting and doing deals with&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>'s various factions, as well as a world that responds to "diplomacy, manipulation, infiltration, and combat" as viable approaches to the situations in which you find yourself.</p>
<p><em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>is the followup to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-newest-rpg-greedfall-comes-to-pc-and-consoles-this-september">2019's&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em></a>, which quickly earned itself a reputation as a janky but ambitious RPG in a similar vein to Piranha Bytes' games on launch. Given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">future of Piranha Bytes looks shaky</a>, this may be the next best place for&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>fans to get their RPG jollies.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/Greedfall_II_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on September 24th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

His influence can even be seen outside of his streams as his catchphrase “what’s up brother” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@titans/video/7355591151639891243&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@titans/video/7355591151639891243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went viral on TikTok</a></span> and even became well known in professional sports circles. On Sunday, July 7, the YouTube channel Pocketbook posted a video with screenshots of what it alleged was Cox’s OnlyFans content. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/07/09/sketch-onlyfans-leak-explained-twitch-streamer-confirms-he-created-adult-content-during-dark-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/07/09/sketch-onlyfans-leak-explained-twitch-streamer-confirms-he-created-adult-content-during-dark-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resulting fallout</a></span> has been a mix: some streamers and influencers have expressed, support, while others have slammed him in predictably homophobic and anti-sex work ways. On July 8, Cox hosted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short response stream</a></span> to address the situation, confirming the legitimacy of the screenshots and saying he made OnlyFans content when he was going through a “dark time” and struggling with addiction. It is real fucking sad that he feels the need to apologize for this, as there should be no shame.</p><p>Cox said that his support system helped him avoid a crisis moment, and he’s already joking about the scenario, so good on him for taking it in stride. A bizarre side effect of all of this is that some of Cox’s (mostly young, male) fans are suddenly learning empathy for queer people and sex workers. It’s an unfortunate reality that homophobes can’t conceptualize queer people and their struggles as real until it’s someone they care about, but if one good thing has come from all of this mess it’s that bigoted people are becoming less so.</p><p>“I clowned him at first I won’t even lie about it,” a TikTok user wrote. “Then I just realized how he must be feeling man. Seeing those texts [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Banks/status/1810399338667147753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Banks/status/1810399338667147753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between Sketch and FaZe Clan’s Banks</a></span>] and then him talking about it just hurt so much to hear man.”</p><p>We’ve reached out to Sketch for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Hopefully, these unfortunate events will lead to more hateful people denouncing their bigoted views. In the meantime, audio from Sketch’s video <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@miss.exclamation_point/video/7389679733220363550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@miss.exclamation_point/video/7389679733220363550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is going viral on TikTok</a></span> in which he parodies U.S. President Bill Clinton’s infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aGbdni7QNs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aGbdni7QNs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“I did not have sexual relations with that woman,”</a></span> sound bite. Even in a rough situation, the dude’s got impeccable comedic timing.</p><p>This controversy comes not long after both top streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Guy “Dr. Disrespect” Beahm admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch</a></span> and was subsequently stripped of almost all of his brand deals, and Nick “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-twitch-ban-slur-mrbeast-drdisrespect-1851566196">Nickmercs</a></span>” Kolcheff was banned from Twitch for saying a transphobic slur. Unsurprisingly, some still voiced support for both controversial streamers, highlighting the often regressive ideologies of those who are plugged into the lives of popular Twitch personalities. So after seeing that unfold, it’s heartening to see some Twitch controversy help people escape bigoted mindsets rather than emboldening them.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Duvall is best known for her portrayal as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film The Shining. However, she is also known for her lead role in the 1980 live-action film Popeye, in addition to her roles in 1974's Thieves Like Us and the 1977 film 3 Women.</p><p>According to her IMDb page, Duvall took a break from acting in 2002, with her last appearance at the time being the 2002 independent film Manna from Heaven.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> developer Nexon has issued a significant update for its popular looter shooter and explained some of its thinking behind the game.</p><p>Patch 1.0.2, out now across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, adds <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hotfix-will-add-much-requested-feature">the promised matchmaking for hard mode Infiltration Operations</a>, renames monster patterns, eases the punishing grind ever so slightly, and makes a raft of bug fixes. Other highlights include slowing down the speed at which the Instructor robot talks (which was too fast to keep up with, really).</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2601132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, Nexon insisted it has no plans to nerf meta builds players are currently using to destroy bosses, called Colossi in-game, in just a handful of seconds. These sorts of builds, which revolve around character Gley and rare machine gun Tamer, were expected, Nexon added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>“It has come to our attention that the community is worried about possible nerfs to Tamer and Gley's infinite magazine builds,” Nexon said. “This meta is very strong, but since it is within the scope of what the dev team has planned, there are no immediate plans to do so.</p><p>“In addition, some weapons are more powerful than Tamer and there are a variety of character builds that rival Gley's infinite magazine, so please enjoy them fully. We've been looking forward to seeing Descendants use creative builds to take down powerful Colossi swiftly, so we're quite delighted to see this in action now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The First Descendant will continue to communicate transparently and honestly.</p></div><p>There’s also an interesting note addressing community concern that the drop rates of certain much-needed items were not accurately displayed in-game. In short, some players felt that The First Descendant’s displayed drop rates were not the actual drop rates in gameplay, after many struggled to get these particular items as part of the free-to-play looter shooter’s punishing grind.</p><p>“We are well aware that as many Descendants begin farming in earnest, various discussions are taking place regarding drop rates,” Nexon acknowledged. “There is no variable drop rate system in The First Descendant. We are using the fixed rates displayed in the game.</p><p>“The dev team has reviewed the acquisition rates across all servers and confirmed that they are dropping according to the rates displayed. We are currently working on various measures to ensure the community can trust the dev team such as disclosing item drop amounts for each content. And we also prepare ways to improve the farming experience. The First Descendant will continue to communicate transparently and honestly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, the patch does not address the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell"><u>The First Descendant’s ultra aggressive monetization</u></a>, nor has Nexon explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story"><u>the remarkable similarities between icons used in The First Descendant and Bungie’s rival looter shooter, Destiny</u></a>.</p><p>Still, The First Descendant is pulling in players, with a peak Steam concurrent player count of 264,860 so far — enough to break into the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft and Sony do not provide player numbers for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><h2>The First Descendant update 1.0.2 patch notes in full:</h2><p><strong>Content Improvements</strong></p><p>- Added the 'Start Public Operation' function (matchmaking) to Infiltration Operations (Hard). 'Start Public Operation' is available even if you change the selected reward, but if you select an additional option, only 'Start Private Operation' will be available.</p><p>- Removed the sequential type Immunity Spheres from Named Monsters. They have been changed to either the default or extermination types.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>The Dev Team acknowledges the community's concern about the monotonous patterns of Named Monsters and strives to enhance them.</p><p>In particular, we've noted that the pattern involving breaking spheres in a specific order isn't appropriate for public matching and have decided to remove it immediately.</p><p>As new patterns are developed, we will soon update the patterns of existing Named Monsters one by one.</p><p>As Named Monsters frequently appear in Hard difficulty and Special Operations, we will continue working towards diversifying their patterns.</p></div><p>- Increased the quantity of rare basic materials dropped from Encrypted Vaults three-fold. The Elite Vulgus that appear in Field Missions and Infiltration Operations will now drop them too.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>The most efficient way to farm rare basic materials is still through Encrypted Vaults, but for those who prefer hunting monsters, we have updated Field Missions and Infiltration Operations to drop these materials too.</p><p>The Dev Team will closely monitor the overall farming status and do our best to create a joyful environment for all our Descendants.</p></div><p>- Reduced the time from two 90-second to two 60-second occupations for the Kingston 'Vulgus Data Transmitter' Hacking Mission.</p><p>- Improved the Battle Pass Battle Supply Shop button's visibility by redesigning it in the format of the Bonus Shop banner.</p><div><p><u><strong># Director's Comment</strong></u></p><p>You can get season-limited skins for free from the Battle Supply Shop.

We've been looking forward to seeing Descendants use creative builds to take down powerful Colossi swiftly, so we're quite delighted to see this in action now.</p><p>We are well aware that as many Descendants begin farming in earnest, various discussions are taking place regarding drop rates. There is no variable drop rate system in The First Descendant. We are using the fixed rates displayed in the game. The Dev Team has reviewed the acquisition rates across all servers and confirmed that they are dropping according to the rates displayed. We are currently working on various measures to ensure the community can trust the dev team such as disclosing item drop amounts for each content. And we also prepare ways to improve the farming experience. The First Descendant will continue to communicate transparently and honestly.</p></div><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Publisher Arc System Works and developer Yuke's have announced Double Dragon Revive, the next entry in the Double Dragon series. It is due out sometime in 2025 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p><p>The game is a 3D revival of the series that debuted in 1987, so it's unclear right now whether this is a remake of a previous title or a completely brand-new adventure. Protagonists Billy and Jimmy Lee return, as well as enemies Roper and Abobo.</p>

<p>Players will be able to pick up weapons scattered throughout stages and use their surroundings to pull off gimmicks. The game's development is being overseen by a staff with experience on previous Arc System Works fighting game titles and is aiming to bring the series to the modern area with refined controls.</p><p>Double Dragon is traditionally a 2D beat-'em-up series, and Revive looks to be keeping the 2D side-scrolling aspect while implementing 3D character models and environments. Arc System Works has been bringing the series back recently. Last year, the developer ported <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-long-missing-double-dragon-games-are-finally-coming-back/1100-6516379/" data-ref-id="1100-6516379">Double Dragon Advance and Super Double Dragon to modern platforms</a>, as well as released a new game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-brings-billy-and-jimmy-back-this-summer/1100-6513790/" data-ref-id="1100-6513790">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a>.</p>

What appealed to you about returning to this style of game and creating something of your own in this genre?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lauridsen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: First of all, the games that inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (RPGs from the early '90s) have a lot going for them that appeal to me: Turn-based combat, lots of exploration, wonderful pixel art, etc. I genuinely think they had qualities that hold appeal to this day and that have become a bit less prevalent in modern RPGs. As RPGs developed as a genre, there were some features that were "thrown out with the bathwater."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/leveraging-emotional-design-features-to-enhance-character-perception-in-pixel-art" target="_self">Leveraging Emotional Design Features to Enhance Character Perception in Pixel Art</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The downside with these classic games is that they tend to be less than accessible these days. For me, I had the experience of coming back to a lot of older titles that I liked the idea of playing more than actually playing them. So, this was a big driver for me: Scratching my own itch for old-school CRPGs! That being said, if you look past the retro graphics, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really is a lot more modern in how it actually plays than you would think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The elevator pitch is "to make a game that plays like our nostalgia-tinged memories of the CRPGs of yore but not how retro CRPGs ACTUALLY played."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>These retro RPGs could be incredibly ruthless and difficult to figure out during their era. What elements did you want to keep from retro party-based RPGs, and which did you wish to change or update to make this game a little less overwhelming for a modern audience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been pretty strict about maintaining a certain graphical expression for the game, which imposes some limits on things like UI design due to the small screen real estate, etc. I also wanted a game with a lot of mechanical complexity. So, in other words, a game where you, the player, actually find it more fun to play the more you learn the "rules" of the system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But all that being said, it's always been important to me to make a game that is as accessible as possible within those constraints. It's been really important not to come across as a gatekeeper for this genre, and this certainly isn't always easy: there's a balancing act between having a game that's fair and welcoming but also challenging and complex. You never get there 100%, but I've done what I can with tutorials, quality-of-life features, a lot of settings, and a customizable difficulty. There are even hundreds of console commands, so you can cheat as much as you like. It's important to me that players get to play the game on their terms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, there are very few (if any) old-school features that I've added just to make life hard for the player. Modern audiences are sensitive to games wasting their time, and though it may not always seem like it, I have tried to make the experience as smooth as possible for players (within the limits of my core design pillars).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, the game is old-school on the surface, but if you can get past that initial layer, you'll find a pretty modern CRPG underneath.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about some of the games that inspired </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD: Against the Black Priory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? What about them that helped inspire elements of your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Gold Box series and the early Ultima games were a large inspiration for the retro aspect of the game. And then the games I REALLY mainlined in my formative years were the Infinity Engine games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 1 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planescape Torment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Icewind Dale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, etc. and games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I think the narrative experience for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is much closer to those games than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for instance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, there's been a lot of great CRPGs coming out lately with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity 1 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Pathfinder games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Trader</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and so forth. I've stolen copiously from these, especially in terms of features and secondary systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are many different characters players can enlist with various personalities, skills, and goals that can really shake up how they play through the game. Can you tell us the ideas that went into creating interesting party members that can add many unique elements to a playthrough?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honestly, I'm a "discovery writer," and NPCs tend to spring forth from who knows where and then assert themselves in the narrative. I genuinely have little influence on what they say and do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I planned to have a lot more of them, but there is an issue where balancing their screen time and interactions takes a lot of work for a solo developer, and it also makes testing very complex. Simply put, the tools I had today meant a lot of manual testing would be needed for a larger stable of NPCs, and there simply wasn't time for it. So, for this game I opted to reduce the number of pre-made characters to ensure the ones that were there had a minimum amount of meaningful interactions. And even then, I left a lot of intra-party lying on the cutting room floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges come from creating a whole vast world filled with different, disturbing places to explore and sidequests to follow up on, as well as an array of classes and abilities, when you're a single developer working on the game? How do you create vast swaths of things to see and do without working yourself to death?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of challenges come from this and I </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>did</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (almost) work myself to death. Making roleplaying games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is beyond complex. The game has a near-infinite number of potential worldstates that each create new and unforeseen interactions and it's very challenging to keep this relatively bug-free. And if you then choose to do this whilst trying to add an interesting narrative on top of it, that increases the challenge substantially. There is a reason so many RPGs feature a lot of fetch quests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only way to solve this (as far as I am concerned) is to develop high-quality, purpose-built tools and to continually seek to evolve workflows. In other words, it's at least partially an engineering challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the challenge with this project was that I made the tool set while making content. That meant that portions of the game were made using tools that varied wildly in quality. Not only that, but since the tools were continually developing, it also took time for me to "learn" them well. Let's just say I learned a lot as a designer as well during development, and as a result, a lot of my best work came at the late stage of the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's inevitable to wistfully think, " Oh, if I could only go back and redo the game starting with the tools I have now."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have to communicate a lot of visual information about a character with only a handful of pixels in the game's top-down viewpoint. Can you tell us about how you design a character or place with a minimum of pixels? How do you still convey mood and character when you only have a tiny amount of room, pixels, and visual details to work with?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's the question, right?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First of all, I had excellent freelancers do most of the non-human models and complex environments. So that's a bit of a cheat, but at the same time, since everything is so minimal, there is a large degree of technical design that goes into making every component work well together. The key here is to first do a lot of work on my end in finding some core principles for the graphic design and then managing to convey that to the artists in a way that ensures I get what I need in terms of technical specs whilst still allowing them to infuse it with as much of their artistry as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Among other things, this requires good communication. It begins with a good, written asset order. Then, a first draft from the artist and then iterating over feedback until we're there. The secret to this workflow (because it can be time-consuming) is that if you have good chemistry, you end up at a spot where you become very well-attuned, and the back-and-forth becomes a lot faster. In the end, it was enough for me to ask one of my illustrators to "Giger it up," and they would know exactly what I was referring to. That's when magic really begins to happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, when it comes to stuff like "How do we make combat readable?" it's honestly just trial and error. Just iterating over feedback until it feels good. Removing friction and adding "juice".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>That said, the game goes into great detail with many of the characters and monsters in cutscenes and specific moments and often excels at capturing gruesome, discomforting, or bizarre things. What thoughts went into really going into detail with this visual style and into creating a sense of unease and fear from these detailed visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once again, this is, first and foremost, the skill of my artists. Secondly, it comes down to the workflow I outlined below. Lastly, I also had a strong core concept of what I wanted the world to look and feel like and how these concepts should feed each other in a way that "permeates" the world with a sense of wrongness. There are a lot of hidden details and subtle stuff that might not register on a surface level, but that come together to form a whole.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another important aspect is that I, very early on, had an idea that I wanted to challenge a bit of the tired "ren-faire" aesthetics that are so common in a lot of fantasy RPGs. I think that it subtly pushes the game towards a more believable look for the mundane aspects while pushing the horrific aspect more in a direction that is closer to the body horror of a lot of sci-fi horror classics. The mix is something that might strike closer to home than a lot of stock standard fantasy horror tropes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What additional challenges or benefits came from taking inspiration from the Commodore 64 palette for making the visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This goes beyond just pure aesthetic preference: I started the project by asking myself, "What is the most simplistic graphical expression I can choose that still allows me to tell the kinds of stories I want to tell?". The reason for this is that I always knew I would be working alone or, at the most, with a handful of freelancers, and I really wanted to keep down asset production logistics whilst still having something expressive. That, in turn, also influenced the game design by driving it closer to a style of game-play that was also more common in the low-fidelity graphics era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It's not pure visuals but also the writing that creates that unsettling feeling. Can you tell us about how you created the game's particular tone with the writing? How did you use words to weave the mood?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How to write cosmic horror, especially for games, is an entire interview unto itself. I'm not saying I'm an expert, but I think I did something right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The big issue with doing it for a roleplaying game, in particular, is that CPRGs tend to be power fantasies. There are, of course, things you can do to lean into the grim darkness and horror aspects of the game, but it was outside the scope of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create a game where your character is going slowly insane while losing limbs. There's also something about this being a very mechanistic approach and that's not particularly conducive to horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, my approach for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to adopt a concept of "subtle wrongness." You may be vanquishing your foes fight after fight, but the deeper you progress into the maze of the narrative, the more clear it becomes that something you can't quite put your finger on is terribly wrong and by the end… Well, let's just leave it at that for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And this is part of the trick: I tend to try to free myself from explaining too much to the player. I try to have a strong canon in my own head but then only drip-feed it to the players. I think this is a large part of successfully pulling off this increasing feeling of subtle wrongness. At the risk of sounding morbid, I kinda want to replicate that terrifying feeling of growing unease you get if you've ever begun to suspect that you might be suffering from some slowly-evolving, but horrific, disease. That anxious looking for symptoms, trying to Google it, and then instantly realizing you would do anything to go back to being ignorant—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is true cosmic horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How do you feel about some of your old favorite games now that you've created your own party-based RPG? How has this affected your opinion of the classics of this genre now that you've lived through everything it takes to create one?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I said above, I think RPGs are some of the most complex projects you can take on and I have an incredible amount of respect for anyone who does it successfully. What's also abundantly clear is how incredibly passion-driven you need to be in order to make a good RPG. It takes pain and suffering and brutal honesty to make a game like this and that's just as true for a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SKALD</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is for a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-episode-7-review-1851587136<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For those of you who’ve felt like any sense of real meaning was gone from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise since it was acquired by Disney, you’re in for a real treat. <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 7 offers a kind of emotional intelligence and narrative pacing that I would normally associate more with that other decades-spanning sci-fi franchise, <em>Star Trek</em>. That’s a very good thing, as it yields a sense of realism and intimacy that raises the bar for this series.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194664,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode 7,&nbsp;“Choice,” is the flashback episode we’ve been awaiting since the series began, promising the big reveal of the inciting incident that has caused years of remorse and spun the web of revenge all characters are connected to. We open on the planet Brendok with Jedi Masters Sol (Lee Jung-jae), Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), and Padawan apprentice Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman). Immediately, we can feel each Jedi’s sense of self with a beautiful wide shot given to us by episode director Kogonada and cinematographer James Friend. The Jedi are in search of a “Vergence”—a powerful centralization of the Force that can create life, such as the lush forests of Brendok. </p><p>This tone of exploration echoes <em>Star Trek</em> in every beat, and affords us a more intimate character portrait for each Jedi. We even get to see them eat together, and without the pressure of any “star war,” we get to see them as people striving for ideals of self mastery and cultivation of wisdom for the benefit of the galaxy. We often hear about these principles when it comes to Jedi, but we don’t often get to feel them without some external pressure distracting us. I absolutely loved this tone, and hope an entire series about the Jedi can be built around it. We don’t always need fighting and chasing to feel something as audience members.</p><p>The search for the Vergence leads Sol to discover the mystical child twins, Mae and Osha (played by real life twin actors Lauren and Leah Brady). Sol sees that Mae has markings of dark magic on her body, while Osha does not, leading him to believe that she may be in danger of being sacrificed by their witch coven, given that a celestial event is about to happen. Sol, who lacks a Jedi apprentice, is bent on making sure the children are safe, and he feels a special connection to Osha, who bears no mystic markings. This desire in the supposedly desire-less Jedi leads to an intentionally muddy web of events that don’t reveal many story points that we haven’t seen in previous episodes. The meaning in this episode has very little to do with what’s happening on the outside and far more to do with what’s happening within each character. It’s this exploration of interiority and character that makes it enjoyable.</p><figure id="" data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the other hand, the episode also suffers from the same Wookiee bias as the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, missing an opportunity to share Kelnacca’s journey. Whether it’s a member of an alien race or a human being from a marginalized group, writers have to be cautious with underrepresenting characters that are killed off (see the old movie stereotype of the “Black guy dies”) or who get their minds controlled by an outside force, both of which happen to Kelnacca as of this episode. There was an anime trope of deeply exploring characters who would be promptly killed off, and as a kid, I always felt the difference in how much more I wanted to know about the characters that died in those stories. Consistently failing to develop characters in a given race is a writing flaw that leads to—for lack of a better term—the dehumanization of that race, even if they’re alien. And since stories educate us on how to view our reality, this can contribute to a lack of consideration and negative treatment of others. So you see, I can’t stop my campaign for Wookiee equal rights.<br></p><p>Amidst all the conflict in this episode, the most overtly significant moment we see is Sol killing Mae &amp; Osha’s mother, Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith). Even here, the filmmaking doesn’t emphasize the action. Rather, we are focused on the emotion of Sol’s reactionary fear that led him to draw his lightsaber on her amongst the air of confusion and defensiveness from both the coven and the Jedi. Sol’s remorse is instant, and we feel it in how he allows himself to be hit repeatedly by Aniseya’s partner, Mother Koril (Margarita Levieva). These moments convey one of the greatest gifts we’ve ever received from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise—the gift of misunderstanding.</p><p>Misunderstanding is hard to write. But&nbsp;<em>The Acolyte</em> has taken its time to articulate all of the players, the cultures, the differences in perspective, and demonstrates how they can all clash. We understand why they aren’t aligned with each other on a very human level. From my training in martial arts and meditation, I know that a sense of peace can be found in conflict. Now, all I’m left seeking is a sense of purpose and completion to the chaos. Let’s hope the finale in episode 8 delivers.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPERMYSTx/status/1811415902480699859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, longtime reliable leaker HYPERMYST teased images of a potential new map for Apex Legends called “District,” also courtesy of leaker Osvaldatore.</p>



<p>The images showcase a circular, neon area full of amusement rides and similar attractions along a coastline. HYPERMYST claims the images reveal “every major POI” from the leaked map. </p>



<p>They also say District is “expected to be released in Season 22.” There are over a dozen detailed images for fans to break down.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Initial fan responses are fairly positive for the “District” map, and new content is always welcome in the game. However, it’s unclear if District will help smooth over interest in Apex Legends, should the map ultimately release in Season 22. </p>



<p>EA faced a lot of fan backlash after announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive changes</a> to the Battle Pass system for Season 22. That includes breaking the Battle Pass into two separate purchases, one for each seasonal split. </p>



<p>It will also remove the Apex Coins pricing option, so fans can only buy Battle Passes with real-world currency.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current season</a> saw the return of Solos, and also introduced the new legend Alter. There was also a recent Double Take Collection Event.</p>



<p>At this time, EA did not officially confirm anything about the District map, nor its potential release window for Season 22.</p>

Not for me it isn't, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as "meandering lazy rivers", "adrenaline-pumping wave pools", "looping flumes" and "exhilarating water coasters". Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent's Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.</p><!--more-->

<p>Planet Coaster 2 is due for release in fall 2024, falling being what happens to your chirpy Pixar-plastic guests if you get a bit too excited when plotting out the ole' loop-de-loops. It'll be available on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/planet-coaster-2-983fe9">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">Steam</a>, and yes, vertiginous watery delights are the major addition, but we can also expect new land-based themepark rides, new park themes such as Viking ("rustic", apparently?) and new flavours of scenery. They're also promising expanded park management tools, multiplayer park-building, and the ability to create "exciting animatronics shows using the new event sequencer tool".</p>
<p>The original Planet Coaster came out in 2016, and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/planet-coaster-review">hailed</a> by Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer) as "a game that inspired me to spend an entire hour constructing a toilet". It features on our lists of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">best non-violent video games</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">best management games</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">best building games</a>. The sequel has big boots to fill, but it's gotten off to a fine start by saturating my eyes and brain with sultry imagery of coruscating plastic tubes of H2O. We'll try to get you one of those "preview" things as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass for console is gone, unless you subscribe already. In its place: Xbox Game Pass Standard, which will no longer include new day one games from Microsoft, Activision, Blizzard and Bethesda. Oh, and everything's going up in price.</p>
<p>Do these changes mark the end of Game Pass being a must-have subscription for Xbox owners? Or, after an impressive summer presentation painting a rosy picture of Microsoft's 2025 slate, are you now more likely to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, where day one launches will remain. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

			<p>A new PC Starfield mod has been released, which addresses various in-game issues with Bethesda's Creation Engine 2.</p>
<p>Created by odder 'LarannKiar', the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10457?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Engine Fixes mod</a> includes various fixes for Starfield's game engine that Bethesda hasn't addressed yet. Mentioned fixes include a fix for player facial expression animation being lost after fast traveling, an NPC headtracking and makeup fix, several fixes for the Papyrus creation engine scripts, fixes for photo mode model facial expressions, player scale, and a fix for an issue that causes the player's spacesuit helmet flashlight to turn off if the player equips/un-equips something while the spacesuit is "hidden" (equipped, but not rendered) in third-person mode.</p>
<p>Being a Bethesda game, issues like these are common, but it's still good to learn that this mod aims to address at least some of the engine issues within Starfield. Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda finally released</a> the long-awaited Creation Kit for the game. The kit allows players to create their own mods for Starfield and share them with the community. The creation kit is the same tool that Bethesda used to create Starfield, &nbsp;and allows for the creation of new quests, environments, characters, dialogue, weapons, and more.</p>
<p>In order to use this mod, users will need the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106">Starfield Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3256"><span>Address Library for SFSE Plugins</span></a>. The mod itself can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10457?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloaded here</a>.</p>
<p>Starfield is available worldwide now for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Following Concord's divisive reveal during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced">Sony's State of Play showcase</a> in May, some had wondered whether the live service hero shooter would release in free-to-play form. Confirming Concord launches in both physical and digital standard editions for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, Pam Piscitello, director of marketing and operations at developer Firewalk, said in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/concord-is-now-available-to-pre-order-early-access-and-beta-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> that this full experience includes all 16 playable characters (called Freegunners in-game), 12 maps set on various worlds, and six team-based modes. This will expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates for all players at no additional cost, Piscitello added.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spelling-game-cryptmaster-feels-like-the-opposite-of-homework.924813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cryptmaster-pc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.akuparagames.com/game/cryptmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cryptmaster</em></a> came out back in May, when Chris Person told me it was pretty good, but for various reasons I only got to it over the holiday. It is indeed pretty good! It’s a dungeon-crawling typing game with a strong personality and a ton of unique things to do. Sometimes that can feel like too many things, but luckily, all those things are <em>really</em> fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You control a team of four undead heroes, each with their own archetype: warrior, thief, bard, and sea witch. Guided by the titular Cryptmaster, a floating head who makes a delightful narrator, you travel through different underground towns and their surrounding swamps and caves to try to make your way to the surface, where the Cryptmaster wants to unleash the undead hordes on the world. Along the way, you help out other characters, solve a lot of word puzzles, and fight a lot of guys.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cryptmaster | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmWRQLbPmsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The combat is typing-based: your characters have cards with letters next to their names, and as you fill those letters in (we’ll get to how you do that in a second) you spell words that unlock powers. Joro, the warrior, has moves like “hit” and “boot” that damage or kick enemies away. Nix, as a sea witch, can unleash damage-dealing rains of crabs, fish, and other aquatic life. Characters can also boost each other’s damage, reset each other’s cooldowns, or heal each other. Most combat words cost “souls” to use, meaning if you’re not careful, you can end up only able to use the basic free attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be honest that combat got a bit out of hand for me. There’s a lot of words to use, and many of them aren’t ones that come readily to mind in a fight (see: “fjord”). I tended to default to the same handful of words, which saw me through most early fights with ease but started to falter in the late game, when I found myself taking too much damage or running out of souls. There’s a lot of things you can do in a fight if you prioritize unlocking as many words as possible, but at the same time, combat can fall into a repetitive trading of blows. It gets mixed up somewhat: Some enemies have armor that can only be broken with a specific word, or can’t be damaged by certain letters, or can <em>only</em> be damaged by certain letters. But these additions never fully rescued combat from sometimes feeling like a grind.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Akupara Games</figcaption></figure><p>Some fights can be avoided by detouring around enemies, which you’ll want to do anyway to unlock new moves, as well as your characters’ memories. You do this through finding letters in a variety of word-based activities you encounter around the map. One of the main ways is finding chests; inside the chests are objects the Cryptmaster has forgotten the name of. You discover what they are through a version of 20 Questions in which you ask the Cryptmaster to do things like “recall,” feel,” “taste,” and “describe.” You then guess the object, and if you guess right, you’ll get the letters in its name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, you find skulls around the world that ask you riddles, which can also give you letters if you solve them. I found these activities way more fun than the combat; they’re clever and playful, occasionally tough, and a real love of language shines through them.&nbsp;</p><p>This love of language is what most stands out to me in <em>Cryptmaster</em>. It’s not a game where you have to <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-a-dark-souls-typing-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid typos</a> or write as fast as possible, or where typing is simply a stand-in for a regular button press. Everywhere in the game there are fun things to do with words: a character whom you help write a song, the Cryptmaster’s wry commentary, a spelling-based card game called “Whatever” that you play against other characters. You save your game at altars by defiling them, typing any sort of naughty word you want. Your souls are replenished by typing the names of fantasy bugs and fish. You open doors by guessing their codes. The penultimate level requires some brain-twisting word games to progress. The game’s black-and-white world might be a bit sparse, but all this spelling and guessing and wordplay makes it feel full.</p><figure><figcaption>Akupara Games</figcaption></figure><p>That fullness doesn’t always work in the game’s favor. I sometimes felt like there was <em>too </em>much to do; I barely explored the potion-making mechanic, or the items for sale at various merchants. The need for souls meant I was often tediously hunting for bugs and fish, and the memories and lore fragments you unlock sometimes felt like too much information. When the game throws plot-moving activities into the mix, all this language, though delightful, can also get overwhelming.</p><p>But these dings are products of exuberance. <em>Cryptmaster</em> feels so in love with its core idea, so eager to show you all the different things you can do with words, that wishing it did a little less feels like not wanting to play fetch with an excited puppy. Overall, it’s a completely charming game, showing off its creativity and giving you tons of space to add your own. I’m glad I finally got to it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Action Square and pubilsher Hybe IM have announced that&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>, a PvPvE dungeon-crawling action RPG that's gunning for&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>'s crown, will launch into Early Access this fall.</p>
<p>In a press release, the studios say that after tests throughout last year and in May of this year,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>will undergo "several beta testing rounds" for the rest of 2024 before being released sometime in fall.</p>
<p>A number of changes have been made to the game since its initial debut in testing, and I'm assuming these changes will make an appearance in the final game. They include the introduction of a tutorial, a number of character and skill balance changes, and quality-of-life improvements, plus lots more.</p>

It was only last year that we played <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons/tag-team-turmoil">Double Dragon Gaiden</a>, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.</p>

<p>This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/aew-fight-forever/stuck-in-the-mid-card">AEW: Fight Forever</a>. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.</p>

            <p>
Frontier has officially announced Planet Coaster 2, the sequel to its popular theme park management game.
</p>
<p>
The studio has been teasing news for the past couple of days on its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/frontier">Twitch channel</a>, with an ongoing stream of park noises. Now it's shown a short in-engine teaser and revealed water parks will be a major new inclusion.
</p>
<p>
The game will be released this autumn, with a full gameplay reveal set for 31st July.

<p>

Players will be able to create lazy rivers, flumes, wave pools, and water coasters, plus changing rooms, sunbeds and lifeguards will be required.
</p>
<p>
The sequel will also include enhanced tools that build on its predecessor, to allow players to create rollercoasters piece-by-piece, as well as enhanced pathing tools, and an enhanced event sequencer tool to combine animatronics, smoke, water jets, sound and more.
</p>
<p>
The game will consist of three modes: Career mode to complete various scenarios; Franchise mode to build a global park network; and a freestyle Sandbox mode.

<p>
Planet Coaster 2 will launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. New details will be revealed on the last Wednesday of each month ahead of release during Frontier Unlocked livestreams.

<p>
The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-review">Planet Coaster</a> was released in 2016 and proved immensely popular for its detailed creation tools. Frontier followed this with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-zoo-releases-for-consoles-in-march">Planet Zoo</a> in 2019, as well as two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-review-a-beautiful-overly-brutal-park-sim">Jurassic World Evolution</a> games.

            <p>Sony has opened up the early access beta for its upcoming 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord to all PlayStation Plus users.</p>
<p>Initially, this beta access was only going to be available to those who had already pre-ordered the game (you can find out more about the editions available and pricing in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-sonys-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-will-launch-with-a-35-price-tag">Matt's story here</a>).</p>
<p>Those in the UK interested in trying out the early access beta can get it pre-downloaded from 6pm this evening (11th July). It will then be available to play from 6pm tomorrow, with cross play support for PS5 and PC. Sony said PS Plus users should look out for the option to download and play the Concord beta when they start up their PlayStation 5s.</p>

<p>"During the early access and open beta, all 16 of our launch Freegunners will be unlocked and available to play and customise," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/11/concord-beta-early-access-preload-and-server-times-pc-specs-and-more-detailed/">developer Firewalk</a> said in a blog post accompanying today's news.</p>
<p>"Whether you want to snipe from afar, lock down an area, provide support for your teammates, or... just dive head-first into the fight, our roster of Freegunners has something for everyone."</p>
<p>There will also be four maps to try out during the early access beta, and three modes: Clash Point, Trophy Hunt and Cargo Run.</p>
<p>When Firewalk then hosts Concord's open beta weekend (which runs from 18th - 21st July), it will add another new mode known as Area Control, and a new map called Bone Mines.</p><p>

"If you plan on joining us for both early access and open beta, your progress will carry over between the weekends," the team said. "However, please keep in mind that your progress from either beta will not carry over to our official launch on 23rd August."

<p>Our Chris went hands on with Concord earlier this year. "Concord can't help but feel like many of the other competent games made by other highly competent former-developers of other big, successful multiplayer games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In other words: a game that places individual moments of that high-level competency within its various disciplines - diverse, fleshed-out characters! Satisfying gunfeel! Intelligently-limited verticality! Sensible environment design! No gameplay-affecting microtransactions! - above an overall uniqueness of vision that binds it together."</p>

We meet the characters separately, but the short scenes reveal a great deal about the nature of each character, and by the end of the episode, we see them cross paths, at least casually.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Supacell</em> is an exploration of survival and synchronicity. While the initial episode focuses on the character of Michael (Tosin Cole), we observe the emergence of each superhero throughout. As indicated in the teaser for the show, you can tell someone’s superpowers are activated or currently active by their eyes—they turn yellow.</p><h2 id="h3610"><a id=""></a>Red vs. blue and complementary lyrics, too</h2><p>Most scenes in <em>Supacell</em> feature a prominent color, either in the lighting or in an object in the scene. One scene features a blue car, for instance, in which a man tells his partner that the blue is her color and her skin looks good next to it. </p><p>Red is also an important color in the show, relating to the prevalence of violence, the presence of Sickle Cell Disease in the Black community (see below), and the untapped vitality of the community. <em>Supacell</em> isn’t shy about showing the consequences of violence, even in the first scene, which, without much context, shows a sinister white man drinking out of a mug in a facility where Black people are imprisoned in cells.</p><p>In a scene set in a club where gang members are present, “Talkin’ da Hardest” by Giggs plays, and the song’s lyrics mirror what the characters experience. “Everyone’s suit same color as Batman” references both the importance of tones and skin color to the show, but also foreshadows the awakening of superpowers for the characters.</p><p>The song goes on to mention being covered in red, implying violence, and the entire scene as well as the clothes the characters are wearing add more red to the scene. Their opposition gang shows up wearing blue, as do many of the initially unconnected characters, such as a healthcare worker and a delivery man.</p><h2 id="h3611"><a id=""></a>Black as the norm</h2><p>Almost every character in the show is Black. When white characters do show up, it’s typically as a symbol of oppression or oversight, and they have a sinister feel to them even if they’re not openly exhibiting racist or otherwise problematic behavior. There’s also sometimes a mystery to them; whereas the Black characters share feelings and emotions with each other, the white characters appear calculating and deliberate. </p><figure id="" data-id="f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-recommend-id="image://f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-format="jpg" data-width="2279" data-height="1283" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vibrant blue BMW on a London city street, with a Black woman in the passenger seat and a man standing next to it.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a white viewer, I noticed the perspective shift: the sense of alarm I felt for the Black characters every time a white character walked by. When white characters observe Black characters, take notice of them, or recognize them as people in any way, there’s a possibility of bad intent or suspicion. I appreciate the clear view of distrust coupled with the obvious reasons it’s necessary.<br></p><h2 id="h3612"><a id=""></a>The system is rigged, surveillance is reality</h2><p>The prevalence of drugs and other alternative economies in the show is depicted as clearly a product of a rigged system. Characters never randomly engage in illegal activity— there’s always a reason, and it usually has to do with making a living in a racist society. Overall, white characters observe and “supervise,” but life has to go on for the Black characters in this framework.</p><p>If white people aren’t actually present and observing, there are sometimes surveillance devices, some of which pick up superhuman activities. Hopefully, we will learn more about who is watching as the series goes on.</p><h2 id="h3613"><a id=""></a>Everyday marginalization and Black identity</h2><p><em>Supacell</em> opens a discussion about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and the sickle cell trait</a></span>, which is more common in Black populations. We learn about Michael’s mom, and the ways she’s been marginalized by the medical system, which treats her like a junkie for asking for pain management for her medical condition. We also hear characters discuss getting promoted more slowly at work due to racism, and talk about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1137193397/missing-persons-of-color-news-coverage-disparities&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1137193397/missing-persons-of-color-news-coverage-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a missing Black person won’t get as much media coverage</a></span> as a white missing person. Most impactful is how this is all presented in a grounded, realistic way: this is BS, but it’s daily life for the characters.</p><p>The character Taze (Josh Tedeku) sums the systemic power imbalance up well when in need of an opportunity: “Money, power, and respect: it’s all there for the taking.”</p><h2 id="h3614"><a id=""></a>The Emergence of superpowers in <em>Supacell</em></h2><p>In the last half of the episode, characters begin to experience superpowers. Some of them realize it, some of them don’t—which makes their eventual connection even more interesting. The show opens up about the nature of the characters’ superpowers in a big way, revealing why Michael’s power is critical to the group. </p><p>My criticism of the show is that thus far, it’s largely male-centric and focusing on the needs of male characters. The women in the show range from soft to tough, which I appreciate—but I’d like to see more of them.<br></p><p>I recommend <em>Supacell</em> to fans of shows like <em>Sense8</em>, which emphasize connections and community between characters who might otherwise be unlikely to cross paths. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new trailer doesn’t feature any gameplay, and it doesn’t provide a concrete release date for Planet Coaster 2. However, the announcement does tease that a first look at gameplay is coming on July 31, 2024.</p>



<p>Frontier’s trailer also warns fans that it only includes “pre-alpha engine footage.” So, although the visuals already look solid, they are still subject to change and improve by the time of release.</p>

<p>That includes some classic coasters, as well as a focus on water parks content, such as pools and water slides. Fans quickly praised the new revealed features, which are sure to increase the scope of the game.</p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">Steam page</a> teases everything from “meandering lazy rivers to adrenaline-pumping wave pools, looping flumes to exhilarating water coasters.” Players can combine these with their coaster rides.</p>

<p>The first Planet Coaster originally launched nearly 10 years ago in 2016.
