			<p>We've just <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-faq/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3iIdzGYSeTvVTrZh08UrAl8dVMwTUk4okUif2S0hgESJInOmQIUwsN4Ms_aem_gDv4y5NjcKyl6HQjo90tPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> PC system requirements. The major advantage over 2020's game is that the installation size on your local drive is much smaller, with only 50GB required. However, the 'recommended spec' now asks for 32GB of RAM, while the 'ideal spec' lists 64GB RAM, which is certainly more than most gamers have installed on their PCs.</p>
<p>Another improvement of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be found in the highly reduced bandwidth consumption, according to Asobo Studio CEO and Co-Founder Sebastian Wloch, who told <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>:</p>
<p><em>The very important thing is overall bandwidth consumption is way down because you only download what you really see when you see it, and we don’t pre-download at hundreds of gigabytes. Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) already had over two petabytes of data on the cloud. That was the whole world data. We kept adding to that, but we still had planes, airports, meshes, points of interests like castles, and textures that were all installed. That’s the part that kept growing with the marketplace content, which had grown to 2 TB. Now we integrated everything into the cloud, and it is all streamed and kept into a rolling cache on the hardware. You don’t have to install any new World Updates; they’re just streamed seamlessly.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MINIMUM SPEC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RECOMMENDED SPEC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IDEAL SPEC&nbsp;</strong></p>

The 2TB “Galaxy Black” special-edition Xbox Series X is mostly the same as the standard Series X, but it features a double-capacity SSD and a slick paint job. We’re inching toward its October 15th release, and interested parties willing to pony up the $599.99 asking price can already preorder one at <a href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Best Buy</a> and directly from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Xbox-Series-X-2TB-Galaxy-Black-Special-Edition/8smbrt7wmfp9">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Those who crave the pricier Xbox are primarily getting three unique things for their money:  </p><div><ul><li>2TB of built-in storage, which is twice the amount available on the standard, $500 Xbox Series X (which can still be expanded with proprietary storage add-ons).</li><li>A fresh paint job, if black is your thing, that’s reminiscent of the star-filled darkness of space. It shares some vibes with Microsoft’s previous limited edition console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"><em>Halo</em>-themed Xbox Series X</a>, and features green accents on its bottom stand.</li><li>A unique controller with matching speckles on the D-pad and a splash of green on the bottom.</li></ul></div><p>Those changes aren’t nearly as drastic as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241002/playstation-5-ps5-pro-comparison-differences-specs-software-ray-tracing">new hardware on the PS5 Pro</a> (which features a new GPU, among other performance benefits), but I must admit the new Xbox looks sick.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="yXNNu1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Xbox Series X – 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition </a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><p>A special edition Xbox Series X with a unique, starry design and an expanded 2TB of built-in storage. It’s the same as the standard Series X otherwise, with features like 4K resolution and Quick Resume.</p></div><p>Outside of the above features, the Galaxy Black Xbox Series X will play all the same games as other Xbox Series X / S models and match the standard edition with its 4K resolution and 120fps frame rate (though it’s locked at 4K / 60fps or lower in most games). It features a Blu-ray drive, too, unlike the compact Series S and <a href="https://howl.me/cm7xSlqtQXQ">discless Series X</a>, the latter of which launches alongside Microsoft’s limited edition console in October for $449.99.</p><p>While the previous generation of Xbox One consoles saw the release of the mid-cycle Xbox One X, the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">PS5 Pro</a> seems to be the lone spec-bumped premium console this generation. Documents revealed during the FTC vs. Microsoft case <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880111/microsoft-xbox-series-x-new-design-refresh">showed a very different take on a refreshed Xbox Series X</a>, complete with a cylindrical design and a new controller with a lift-to-wake feature. These new Xbox consoles are obviously not that, but Microsoft calling an audible on that plan is not terribly surprising as recent times have been tough for the Xbox division with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio closures</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">layoffs</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform">plenty of strategy shifts</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Galaxy Black Xbox Wireless Controller features a unique D-pad and green undercoating.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em> bundle is a dream come true for fighting game fans. Not only is each of the six fighting games being brought to modern gaming hardware, in some cases properly playable for the first time in many years, but each has a bunch of extra additions, and unique properties. Let’s break down the entire collection.<br></p><p>Alongside the six games, <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics </em>contains a wealth of quality-of-life improvements and extras. For each game there are dedicated training and practice modes (complete with hitboxes, hurtboxes, startup information, input readers, and more), along with rollback netcode to let you play with friends from all over the world, display filters, and customizable difficulty and attribute (timer speed, attack power) settings.</p><p>Then, on top of that, you’ve got full move lists, marquee cards (previously shown only on arcade cabinets) and music players, as well as a museum mode full of concept art, high-definition character and game art, and tons more.<br></p><p>Hit Next to get into the games, themselves! </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-recommend-id="image://bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-recommend-id="image://bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s hard to call <em>any</em> version of these games “grounded,” but <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> is certainly the <em>most</em> grounded and straightforward of this collection. A six-button fighting game, characters have more normals and fewer specials than in other versions, letting you focus on your movement, managing your meter, and selecting the Light, Medium, or Heavy versions of your limited special moves to express yourself. </p><figure id="" data-id="f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-recommend-id="image://f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-recommend-id="image://f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is also one of the few games in this collection that is 1v1, meaning you don’t have to manage your tag team partner’s health, assist calls, or anything like that. Just pick your character, get used to their moves, specials, and supers, and make the most of them. On the ‘<em>Street Fighter</em>’ to ‘wild 3v3 nonsense’ spectrum, <em>Children Of the Atom</em> is as close to <em>Street Fighter</em> as this collection gets.<br></p><p>  Because of that, this is the best entry if you like your fighting games simple and straightforward. While quite a few special moves can be a bit wild (particularly Omega Red, with his screen-filling tentacles), it’s still probably the best entry in the series for the classic, grounded gameplay players have come to expect from Capcom titles like <em>Street Fighter</em>. There’s even an ‘auto-guard’ mode, which is perfect for beginners who want to ease into things. The music is also rocking, which is always a big plus.</p><h3 id="h3353"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> The coolest character is obviously Iceman <em>(You’re fired—Ed)</em>, but some of the others include: Omega Red, Sentinel, and Wolverine.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-recommend-id="image://97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-recommend-id="image://97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Expanding beyond the X-Men, this was the first entry in the franchise to incorporate heroes and villains from the larger Marvel universe. Fan favorites like Spider-Man, Hulk, and Iron Man make an appearance, as well as some more niche villains like Shuma Gorath and Blackheart.</p><p><em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> also distinguishes itself by incorporating an Infinity Gem mechanic, a theme that would return much later in <em>Marvel VS. Capcom Infinite</em>, even if the mechanic itself changed quite a bit. </p><figure id="" data-id="0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-recommend-id="image://0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-recommend-id="image://0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Here you attack your enemies with special moves to knock Infinity Gems out of them, pick them up, then activate their unique effects with a special input. The effect changes based on which Gem is used, with the Soul Gem giving health back to the player, and other gems giving you increased speed, armor on your attacks, and more. When the Infinity Power gauge fills up, filled by every attack, you’ll also gain access to an Infinity Special. </p><p>  This is the best entry for players who like the gameplay of <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, but want a bit more meat on the bone. With a more varied cast and the Infinity Gem mechanic to deal with, things aren’t as straightforward as they initially seem. This means there is a little more to dig into while staying in a 1v1 fighting game format. The ‘auto-guard’ beginner-friendly mode from <em>Children of the Atom</em> also returns, although this time it limits you to only three Arcade Mode battles if you select it.</p><h3 id="h3354"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p>Wolverine, Spider-Man, Iron Man and Magneto</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-recommend-id="image://f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-recommend-id="image://f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> The precursor to <em>MvC</em>, this is when things really started to kick off. The first tag game and the first crossover game in the series, it paved the way for what would come later, although it left behind the greater universe reflected in Marvel Super Heroes, focusing on only the X-Men side. </p><figure id="" data-id="ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-recommend-id="image://ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-recommend-id="image://ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> It also made some key changes to the Capcom characters, compared to their <em>Street Fighter</em> counterparts. Ryu and Ken are very similar, however Ryu has larger fireballs and he can throw them horizontally in the air. If that sounds like Akuma to you, just wait, because not only did they give Akuma’s diagonal air fireball to Ken, but scrolling off the upper edge of the character select screen reveals a hidden character; Akuma himself. </p><p>  <em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter</em> is great if you want to experience a solid, but basic, tag fighting game. It still controls like the earlier games in the series, but this time you’ll control two characters. What makes it great as a ‘beginner’ tag game? Instead of also having to learn how to use Assist attacks from your off-screen character, all you need to do is switch your injured character out when they have taken damage, letting them heal off-screen before you switch back to them. Interestingly, this means it’s also the closest gameplay equivalent to the most recent<em> MvC</em> entry, <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite</em>, a very fun game in its own right.</p><h3 id="h3355"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> Storm, Magneto, Wolverine, Sabretooth, and (of course) hidden character Akuma.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-recommend-id="image://af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-recommend-id="image://af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> This is where the <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom</em> formula truly takes shape for the first time, so it makes perfect sense that—especially if you want to dip your toes into the series before it demands learning three characters—<em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter</em> is a great place to start. Characters are very similar to the later <em>MvC</em>, but you only have two per team. This also means things are a bit less hectic and easier to keep track of. </p><figure id="" data-id="b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-recommend-id="image://b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-recommend-id="image://b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The final missing piece of the <em>MvC</em> formula, added in this entry, is the Assist. Press Medium Punch and Medium Kick to summon your off-screen teammate to perform their assist attack. With a broad range of abilities, and the option to do simultaneous supers with both team members at once, this entry in the series lets players set up some of the grimy and oppressive situations the series would later become known for, even if it does tone down some things, like infinites from <em>X-Men Vs.

Even if your favorite character isn’t on the main roster, they likely appear as a Special Partner, the name for the assist mechanic in <em>MvC1</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-recommend-id="image://9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-recommend-id="image://9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h3357"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p>Strider, Captain Commando, Venom, Gambit (and the five hidden characters)</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-recommend-id="image://781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-recommend-id="image://781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> The classic. The gold standard for beautiful nonsense. The reason people were so excited this collection was announced.

This entry also got rid of the dedicated ‘assist’ character list, opting to add three assists to each playable character, and letting you choose which type of assist you wanted them to use. Now you need to think about more than just withdrawing wounded characters so they can heal: You’ll need to consider which assists you’ll have backing you up if you momentarily retreat. </p><h3 id="h3358"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> Sentinel, Cable, Dr. Doom, Strider (but there is tons of fun to be had with loads of characters in this game) </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-recommend-id="image://52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-recommend-id="image://52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> One of these things is not like the other, and this time, it’s <em>The Punisher</em>.

<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added ability to Save Custom Audibles across all modes.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As you change audibles in your formation at play call, they will save automatically and will not change from game to game. You will be able to do this for up to 32 playbooks. To change audibles, press LT/L2 after choosing a formation in playcall.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Tuned Wear and Tear to slow down the accrual rate.</li>



<li>Fixed a kickoff exploit where players could cause the ball to not be caught by the receiving team.
<ul>
<li><em>Dev Note: We will continue to monitor feedback on this fix and will make further changes if necessary.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems which resulted with a Speed Boost off the line at the snap.</li>



<li>Slight Composure tuning to increase the impact to attributes when getting hot or cold.</li>



<li>Several Zone Coverage AI improvements:
<ul>
<li>Addressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to bail too quickly from their alignment at the snap.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Added Cover 4 Field Drop to Nickel 3-3 Over and Nickel Over
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dev Note:&nbsp;</strong>This is a 3-man rush with 8 defenders dropping into coverage; by default, the Nickel DB aligns to the wide side of the field and the defensive end on the opposite side (short side of the field) will drop into coverage.</em></li>

                <p>Almost everyone's experience in the Dragon Age games varies depending upon the choices they make while playing them. And according to BioWare, the team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-bioware-at-its-most-confident/1100-6526566/" data-ref-id="1100-6526566">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> wants to honor the choices made by players in the previous titles by not being tied down to only one official continuity.</p><p>Creative director Jon Epler told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-devs-try-to-avoid-the-idea-of-there-being-a-single-canon-and-theyd-rather-ignore-your-choices-in-the-previous-rpgs-than-undo-them" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that as far as BioWare is concerned, the studio wants to "avoid the idea of there being a single canon" in the Dragon Age games. He added, that "if we don't feel we can do something respectful of the choice you made we oftentimes just don't necessarily reference it... We never want you to feel like your world state is being invalidated."</p><p>Since The Veilguard takes place roughly a decade after Dragon Age: Inquisition, one of the ways that BioWare addressed the issue was by setting the sequel in a different part of Thedas. Epler noted that the key to juggling the multiple-canon approach was by never directly contracting the decisions made by the players in the older games.</p><p>"We may not always reference your choice, because it may not have an actual impact on the story that you're telling right now," said Epler. "But we're never going to be like 'and that thing you did never happened.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 31.</p>

            <p>
With the holiday season (and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>) on the horizon, Nintendo has announced a trio of new Switch bundles available from today in Europe. 
</p>
<p>
Looking to introduce a friend or family member to Animal Crossing? There's a bundle which packs in a Nintendo Switch Lite and a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-a-magical-vivarium-and-one-of-nintendos-best-games-yet">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, plus 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership. This is available either in Coral (featuring Isabelle) or Turquoise (featuring Timmy &amp; Tommy) colours.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-2_DbKCzJD.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
For those looking to keep active inside as the weather gets colder, another bundle option is available featuring a vanilla Nintendo Switch with the classic Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con. This will have Nintendo Switch Sports pre-installed, a Leg Strap accessory, plus 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online. 
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-11111.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
These bundles differ from those announced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> this week, which feature <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> - the console's most popular game - with either a vanilla Switch or a Switch OLED.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's online store has the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle priced at £200 - meaning you effectively get the game and Switch Online membership at no extra cost. 
</p>
<p>
It's the same with the Switch Sports bundle, which Nintendo's online store is selling for £260 - the same price as a standard vanilla Switch. 
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Switch 2 set for a 2025 launch</a>, these bundles will likely help shift hardware for Nintendo as the company prepares for the Switch 1's last Christmas. Do you know anyone without a Switch yet?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation is approaching its 30th anniversary of the first PlayStation console, and Hideaki Nishino on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a> has announced that there will be a PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection. The aesthetic is that of the PlayStation 1 and pays homage to the console that launched on December 3, 1994. The collection will be sold in "highly limited supply," as the consoles won't only just come with the limited edition skin but will come with original PlayStation controller-style cable housing, a sticker, and a Paperclip, as an example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amdZnHooTkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not only will the PlayStation 5 Pro get this bundle, but the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition will also get the limited edition version of the console, as well as the DualSense controllers and a Console Cover for the Disc Drive (which is sold separately).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player will also receive a limited edition skin in the 30th Anniversary Collection. Since the PlayStation 5 Pro was announced recently along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/">its price tag</a>, it's fair to assume that the limited edition console is going to cost a pretty penny. At the moment, it has not been announced how much any of the items will cost, but if you get the full PlayStation 30th Anniversary collection, it can be expected to cost at least $850.</p>
<p>In total, there will only be 12,300 units of the PlayStation 5 Pro Console available for customers to purchase, all of which will have their limited edition numbers etched into the unit, representing the month and date of the first PlayStation console launch.</p>
<p>For those who want to get hold of this bundle, it will be available for pre-order on September 26 on the PlayStation website. For regions where the direct website isn't available, pre-orders will begin on September 26 at participating retailers. The PlayStation 5 Digital Edition bundle will be available for pre-order at participating retailers beginning October 10, with the DualSense Wireless Controller being available for pre-order at participating retailers beginning September 26.</p>
<p>It's also possible to buy the Portal Remote Player and DualSense Edge Wireless Controller on their own, rather than purchasing the whole bundle. According to the blog post, Sony has a lot of things lined up for the anniversary of the console, such as a free weekend of online multiplayer, PS5 Esports tournaments, and some of the most iconic PlayStation game soundtracks available to stream.</p>
<p>Sony has set up a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page specifically</a> for the 30th anniversary so that those interested can see what is upcoming for Sony and whether anything else will be added in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Preorders are now open for <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> through the Microsoft Store. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preview/">next installment of the franchise</a> will launch on Xbox and PC on November 19th, with updates that include new aircraft like hot air balloons and a more realistic-looking simulated earth. But the most welcome upgrade could be a much smaller installation size.</p><p>The current version of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> needs over 130GB of storage, but that’s just for the base version of the game. Players can enhance their experience by downloading additional aircraft or installing world updates that bring more details to local scenery and airports, but that can gobble up even more storage. Those playing on the Xbox Series S, which only offers players 364GB of storage, could potentially see almost all of that disappear on one game.</p><p>Microsoft says the installation size for <em>MSFS 2024</em> has been reduced to “about 30GB” by “tapping into the latest cloud streaming technology” and “streaming in the higher detailed areas that are only necessary for your flight path.” The game will no longer require players to download hefty world updates, but not at the cost of the game looking worse. That data will instead be streamed on demand with higher-resolution graphics being swapped in as players soar closer to landmarks like airports and cities.</p><div><figcaption>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <em>will accurately depict how hot air balloons inflate and fly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Aspiring pilots still can’t use <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> as a way to earn their license, but it does introduce a new career system that will mimic an aviation career. Players start off by taking flying lessons that include more preflight procedures like route planning based on weather forecasts. As their skills improve, they’ll be able to take on jobs like search and rescue missions, aerial firefighting, and commercial flights, before eventually earning enough virtual money to start and manage their own companies within the game that includes maintaining a private fleet.</p><p>New aircraft coming to <em>MSFS 2024</em> include the Boeing 747-400 LCF Dreamlifter, a custom variation of the plane that Boeing uses to help manufacture the 787. For pilots who prefer something less stressful than flying airplane parts around a simulated world, the game will feature hot air balloons powered by a realistic “soft body simulation.” Turning on the burners will actually cause the balloons to inflate and gain altitude.</p><div><figcaption><em>Improved ground detailing in </em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024<em> will also affect where and how some aircraft can land.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will be available in several editions, ranging in price from $69.99 to $199.99 depending on the number of planes and airports that come bundled. The Standard Edition will also be available through Xbox Game Pass starting on launch day.</p><p>Those who’ve been playing the previous version of the game for four years will have a chance to put their piloting skills to good use earning a simulated salary, and <em>MSFS 2024</em> will potentially let them free up some storage space so they can try another game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With God of War Ragnarok's PC release coming soon, Sony revealed that there is an option to reduce the frequency in which players hear puzzle hints from other characters.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the new option is in the Gameplay Settings tab. Enabling it will make it so that companions like Atreus and Mimir won't provide puzzle hints nearly as often. For some players, the banter was quite annoying. While the game's puzzles aren't overly difficult to solve, some players still like to figure them out by themselves.</p><p>The game is also getting cinematic audio descriptions, which plays audio descriptions of visual events during cutscenes. This helps provide additional context alongside the spoken dialogue in order to create a more detailed experience for players with low vision. The feature can be enabled under the audio accessibility menu.</p><p>Sony also confirmed that both the puzzle-hint frequency and audio-description features will be added to the console versions soon.</p><p>God of War Ragnarok launches for PC on September 19.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/real-reasons-not-to-build-custom-game-engines-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s 2024, and indie developers still face the same question: should you use a proprietary engine or build your own? Recently, Game Developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/why-and-how-you-should-leave-unity-and-unreal-to-make-your-own-engine">published</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> an article about Rez Graham’s talk at GDC 2024 in San Francisco. It hit home for me as someone who built their game on a custom engine instead of using what was already out on the market. During the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highfleet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I often questioned whether that was the right call. So, is building your own still worth it, or should you stick with the big-name engines? And if it’s worth it – when?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Custom engines were necessary for pushing performance limits or creating something truly unique. However, with industry-standard engines like Unreal and Unity offering increasingly powerful and flexible tools, the need for custom engines continues to decrease. On the one hand, this creates a degree of uniformity, as many games are developed using the same foundational technology, which gives the games a familiar appearance to players. At the same time, it lowers the barrier to entry, allowing more talented indie developers to bring their ideas to life. The key is determining whether the time and effort required to build a custom engine aligns with your project’s goals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Three misconceptions about building a custom engine"><span>Three misconceptions about building a custom engine</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. A game engine is just about rendering sprites</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One common misconception (that we also initially had) when deciding to build a custom engine is thinking that an engine is only about rendering sprites, animations or shaders. In reality, engines come packed with a wide range of functionality that you’ll have to implement yourself if you're building from scratch, such as:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rendering sprites, animations, or shaders.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Handling physics and collision detection.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Managing input from various devices (mouse, keyboard, different types of controllers, racing wheels).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ensuring multi-platform compatibility (minimizing effort for porting your game to PS/Xbox/Nintendo/mobile platforms).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Built-in opportunities for creating multiplayer functionality and handling network communications.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Support for complex audio systems, including spatial audio and dynamic soundtracks.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimizing performance for various hardware configurations, from high-end PCs to mobile devices.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A host of other details, such as built-in support for multiple languages, saving/loading game states, and more.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underestimation of the scope of features that modern engines provide can lead to months or even years of extra development time, especially when you have to implement things that most proprietary engines already handle out of the box.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. I know my game’s needs and can build a custom engine around them</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This one is incredibly common. You might think that you fully understand what is required in your specific case and create an engine that is the perfect fit. But in reality, game development rarely goes according to plan, especially in indie projects. You might start with a simple concept, but as the project grows, you will need to scale the game world or add more complex effects. That’s when you realize your custom engine wasn’t built for these new demands, and then performance starts to suffer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take the render pipeline, for example. Let’s say a small indie team builds a custom 2D engine, and everything runs fine — until they decide to scale the map 10x or add more detailed special effects. Suddenly, the engine struggles, and performance drops. At this point, the team has to either optimize or, in many cases, rewrite parts of the engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe the game was built around DirectX 11, but now they need features from DirectX 12, which forces a full migration. Our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highfleet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> engine went through this process, moving from DirectX 9 to 10, and eventually to 11, with each transition requiring significant rework.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine – a studio sets out to create a 2D platformer, like most traditional ones. The designer outlines the vision, and the developers build a custom 2D engine tailored to the game. But after much of the work is already done, the designer decides the game would look better with 3D trees in the background, casting soft shadows on the 2D characters. For a developer using a proprietary engine, this would still present challenges, but for someone with a custom engine, it could be catastrophic. The engine wasn’t built for 3D rendering, and 3D wasn’t even a possibility in this case, so now the team would need to go back to square one: researching theory, planning the architecture and render pipeline, coding the new functionality, integrating it with the existing engine, testing, optimizing, and testing again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even smaller, less drastic, but frequent changes to the requirements for a custom engine can turn it into a never-ending development project, taking valuable time away from refining the actual gameplay.</span></p><p>Screenshot from 2D platformer game Shovel Knight. Image credit: CNET.com</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proprietary engines are built to handle these kinds of changes from the start, allowing you to adapt much faster and focus on what really matters — your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. Building your own engine is faster (or cheaper)</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s easy to think that building your own engine will save time and money, but that’s rarely the case. To develop a game using an engine like Unity or Unreal Engine 5, you need to invest time learning them. While this can take a while, it's still a much smaller time investment compared to building your own engine from scratch and learning the underlying technology needed for it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, once a programmer understands Unity or UE5, they can quickly implement new features. When a new version of DirectX comes out or new rendering techniques (like RTX) become popular, the engine developers handle the integration of those technologies. All the programmer has to do is update their engine and apply the new features in their game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you’re building your own engine, though, updates don’t come automatically. If a new version of DirectX is released or new rendering trends emerge, you have to study the theory behind those technologies, and manually integrate them into your engine, and only then can you start using them in your game. This can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for a small team. For example, a quick YouTube tutorial on “How to add RTX lighting in UE5” is 40 seconds long. But to add RTX lighting to your own engine, in a way that meets all your game’s needs and is well-optimized, would take much more time and effort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another big advantage of proprietary engines is the vast amount of pre-existing assets, shaders, and algorithms made by other developers, which you can easily plug into your game. In contrast, with a custom engine, you’re constantly reinventing the wheel, chasing industry trends, and building everything from the ground up. Even technologies that have existed for years — such as various lighting algorithms, shadows, bloom, bump mapping, diverse post-processing effects, weather systems, water surfaces, etc. — will require manual implementation from your side. Yes, open-source projects with the right licensing, developer forums, and sites like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be incredibly helpful resources, but at the end of the day, it’s up to you to integrate all of that into your game.</span></p><p>Shadertoy.com, Greek Temple shader by Inigo Quilez</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is exactly what Rez Graham was talking about at the GDC conference I mentioned earlier. The key benefit of using proprietary engines is what he called "automatic knowledge." By using a well-established engine, you gain access to institutional knowledge shared by other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And about the cost — yes, Unity and other proprietary engines do charge fees, but those costs are minimal compared to the time it takes to develop your own engine. Unless you’re selling millions of copies, building your own engine doesn’t offer much financial benefit. You could argue that it pays off in the long run, but that’s only true if your engine is robust enough to support multiple projects in the future.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What about libraries?"><span>What about libraries?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, some of the features proprietary engines offer can be achieved in custom engines by using third-party libraries. For example, you can handle physics with libraries like Box2D, and sound with BASS. However, while these libraries can be helpful, you still need to integrate them into your project, and they won’t cover all the needs of a game developer in each area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main challenge with using standalone libraries is that they only handle specific tasks, and it’s up to you to ensure everything integrates smoothly. Proprietary engines, on the other hand, already have these systems built in, reducing the need for heavy customization and allowing you to focus more on game development rather than technical integration.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this mean for the industry?"><span>What does this mean for the industry?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you’ve likely guessed, the challenges mentioned above push most developers to choose proprietary engines, which is a logical and justified decision. However, looking at the bigger picture, this creates a certain degree of technological monopolization within the gaming industry, sadly leading to less project diversity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because many developers use the same engines, like Unity, they might end up using the same assets and shaders, causing games to feel similar or even – generic. Additionally, proprietary engines are often optimized for more traditional game types. If a developer is working on something truly unique, there are cases where a custom engine could better serve the project’s needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of a justified use of a custom game engine is the well-known Noita. The game has a truly unique concept that likely wouldn’t have worked with any existing proprietary engine, a uniqueness captured in the name of its engine, "Falling Everything." Yet, Noita doesn’t rely on advanced graphical effects, it’s single-player, and it was built exclusively for one platform — PC.</span></p><p>Screenshot from Noita. Image credit: Steam</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Top three reasons to build a custom engine"><span>Top three reasons to build a custom engine</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. You have no other choice</span></span></p><p>Screenshot from Mount &amp; Blade. Image credit: Steam</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes, you don’t have the option of using an existing engine because the game you want to create relies on new technology that isn’t supported by current engines — or can’t be adapted as easily as you’d like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This might mean building a large-scale simulation that needs really low-level control to run efficiently (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dwarf Fortre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">ss or</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Noita</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In cases like these, using a standard engine could slow you down because it won’t give you the flexibility to optimize at the level you need.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another example is when your game mechanics are so unique that no existing engine fits the vision. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mount &amp; Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> needed custom engines because their gameplay doesn’t follow conventional patterns, and trying to make a standard engine work would have meant constantly running into limitations or forcing it to do things it wasn’t originally built for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;2. You have (really) big plans</span></span></p><p>Screenshot from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Image credit: dualshockers.com</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re thinking long-term and planning to grow your studio, building your own engine could make sense. This isn't just a one-off investment for a single game — it’s something you’ll use across future projects as you scale. But, it’s important to understand the magnitude of resources required to pull this off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By making your own engine, you can optimize your workflow specifically for the kind of games you’re making. This is the path that CD Projekt RED took. Their REDEngine was developed over many years and was used in hits like The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. However, what’s telling is that even with all the arguments in favor of using their own engine — sufficient human and financial resources, extensive experience in engine development, and significant sales volumes that would make third-party engine licensing fees substantial — CD Projekt RED still decided to retire REDEngine and partner with Epic Games to use Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. You want to be technically, legally, and financially independent</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're using a third-party engine and encounter a bug or missing feature that impacts your game, you often have no choice but to wait for the engine’s developers to fix it. With a custom engine, you can solve these problems immediately as they come up, giving you full control over your development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another downside of proprietary engines is the cost. For example, Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) takes a 5% royalty on gross sales after your first million dollars in revenue. But what’s worse is that the owner of the engine can change the terms of use at any time. This risk became very real during the Unity pricing controversy in late 2023. Although they rolled back some of those changes, the incident highlighted a serious risk for developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a custom engine, you avoid these uncertainties — no unexpected fees, no sudden changes in licensing, and total control over your tech.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Writing your own engine is a complex task. It’s a natural fit for large studios working on AAA projects since they have the manpower and resources to develop, maintain, and update their engines to stay on top of modern technologies. For these studios, the cost of developing their own engine is easily offset, especially by avoiding fees associated with third-party engines. Plus, they’re often working on multiple projects, making the investment in a custom engine even more worthwhile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers can also benefit from creating their own engine, particularly if they’re working on a highly specialized single-player game that doesn’t require multiplayer support, multi platform compatibility, or technologies like complex graphical effects, ray tracing, or global illumination. Additionally, indie devs may want to avoid the risks that come with relying on proprietary engines and their changing terms. However, even in these cases, it’s essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully — using a proprietary engine might still be the better option in the end.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC release date, so get ready to hose down a bunch of&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-related locations and objects. As the Steam page says, "playtime is ogre".</p>
<p>Landing on October 10th, the&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC is the latest in a long line of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Other collaborations have included&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>.</p>
<p>In this particular DLC, you'll be able to take your powerwash tools to five different&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>-themed maps, each of which has a veritable kingdom's worth of dirt and grime for you to blast off.</p>

<ul><li>Duloc</li>
<li>Hansel's Honeymoon Hideaway</li>
<li>Shrek's Swamp</li>
<li>Fairy Godmother's Potion Factory</li>
<li>Dragon's Lair</li>
</ul><p>As well as all of these maps, you'll also get access to a custom knight model for your character, and your power washer will take on the appearance of a sword, for what is knightly duty if not vanquishing filth from the kingdom?</p>
<p>If you want to see the&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator Shrek&nbsp;</em>DLC in action, then you can do so right here via the release date announcement trailer. Somebody once told me it's pretty good.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, it's a work sim game in which the aim is to visit a series of grimy locations and hose them down with your power washer.</p>
<p>Playing either solo or with your friends in online multiplayer, you'll build a business, switch up your tools for the job, and generally relax as you purge dirt and restore cleanliness to the land.</p>
<p>Although our own reviewer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review">wasn't particularly impressed</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-player-count">found a niche for itself</a>, garnering enough interest for Miniclip to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition">acquire developer FuturLab</a> earlier this year.</p>
