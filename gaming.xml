			<p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is expected to be fully released later this year, according to modder 'Halk Hogan'.</p>
<p>A new video providing a preview of the 'real next-gen' textures included with the graphical overhaul project was some hours ago, providing comparisons with the vanilla and complete editions of CDPR's hit title. As we've covered before, the graphical differences are significant, and those PC players who want to re-experience The Witcher 3 once more, will surely be happy with this project. Although the creator of the mod hasn't provided an exact release date for The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition just yet, he does mention that he plans to release it before the end of the year.</p>
<p><em>"I'm happy to show you what I've been working on lately: true next-gen high-quality textures using the new mapping technique implemented in the Nextgen version of the game"</em>, the modder writes. <em>"Thanks to this, many textures in HDRP NextGen Edition will be much more realistic, and the examples shown in the video are only a part of all of them. The cost of performance is relatively low, so you definitely shouldn't worry about it. As for the release date, I can't give any details yet, because there's a huge amount of work to do, but <strong>expect a release this fall</strong>."</em></p>
<p>We've included the new texture preview video, as shared by 'Halk Hogan' earlier today, below:</p>

<p>The first version of the HD Reworked Project for The Witcher 3 Next-Gen was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-nextgen-hd-reworked-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> back in December of last year. For those unfamiliar with the modder's work - the HD Reworked project aims to massively improve the game's textures and models while preserving the original style.</p>
<p>Some months ago, 'Halk Hogan' released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/witcher-3-next-gen-mods-mirrors-ray-tracing-hd-reworked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new video for the project</a>, highlighting some of the improvements included with the graphical overhaul. We'll update you as soon we learn more about The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project Next-Gen Edition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8830L5">We are so back. And by “we,” I mean video games. At a half-dozen slickly produced promotional events over the next week, games will be teased in the form of captivating cinematic trailers with promises to push the medium forward.</p>
<p id="ireaBz">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">annual Summer Game Fest extravaganza</a>, host <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099616/summer-game-fest-2024-date-livestream">Geoff Keighley’s replacement for E3</a>, kicks off the promotional activities on Friday, June 7. The rest of the weekend is also filled with similar hours-long events from Xbox, Activision, Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, and other organizers who have rallied smaller, indie-created games for a combined show of force.</p>
<p id="apTcxc">There’s an expectation that the annual parade of trailers for exciting new games will include plenty of games that won’t be out for many months, if not years, after their unveilings. To be clear, that happens every year. And I’m here to remind you that there are countless unreleased games that were announced with gusto at similar events in years past — some of which have slipped from the public consciousness, and we’re convinced that if they don’t show up in a meaningful way over the next couple weeks, it’s so over.*</p>
<p id="NadTRJ"><small><em>*It’s not really over, especially given the </em></small><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer"><small><em>volatile state of the video game industry</em></small></a><small><em>. But we’re getting pretty worried/impatient about the following games and honestly hope they show up, look great, and will be critical and commercial successes — all of them.</em></small></p>
<h2 id="5Kl77a"><strong>Monolith’s Wonder Woman game</strong></h2>
<div id="HfLZlY"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyA8lnp9Tzg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Gzpmgp">Announced in 2021, developer Monolith Productions promised to bring its patented Nemesis System from <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22827136/wonder-woman-game-monolith-dc-warner-bros-the-game-awards-2021">a game based on Wonder Woman</a>. We were excited about it, even with the taste of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22176146/wonder-woman-1984-review"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a> relatively fresh in our mouths, but haven’t heard a peep about the game since then. DC’s approach to video games based on its characters has changed since the announcement of <em>Wonder Woman</em>, and we remain hopeful that Monolith can capture the magical feeling of battling wisecracking Orcs in a game that gives us control of Diana Prince and her golden lasso.</p>
<h2 id="w2dNbQ"><strong>Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell remake</strong></h2>
<div id="zRl9CE"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="gQdW2k">Another announcement that dates back to 2021? Ubisoft Toronto’s plan to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22837857/splinter-cell-remake-announcement-ubisoft-toronto-snowdrop">remake the original <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</em></a>. The new <em>Splinter Cell</em> promises to take advantage of 20 years of technical innovations and to rework parts of the game’s story “that may not have aged particularly well,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23366680/splinter-cell-remake-story-update">creative director Chris Auty said in 2022</a>. Showing off the Splinter Cell remake at Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase would go a long way to appeasing longtime Xbox fans, with a deeper dive ideally poised for Monday’s Ubisoft Forward event. Just sayin’.</p>
<h2 id="Vn6ac3"><strong>Skate. (Skate 4)</strong></h2>
<div id="BTPUqR"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzRbbgaqAvo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="IYH3zt">Credit to Electronic Arts: The publisher and development team, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22252237/skate-4-developer-electronic-arts-full-circle">Full Circle</a>, has been very transparent about the development of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/18/21296386/skate-4-ea-its-happening">the next Skate game</a> — which is called <em>skate.</em>, not<em> Skate 4</em>, officially — and opened up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23189826/skate-4-early-access-insider-program-electronic-arts">playtesting to in-progress versions of the game</a>. But please give us the new Skate already! How about a release date? Barring that, can I get a beta key? I want to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23691303/skate-4-update-activities-playtesting-flumping">flump</a>, too.</p>
<h2 id="5Lu3Ti"><strong>Capcom’s Pragmata</strong></h2>
<div id="1jiszn"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0GIfbmLEro?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="czD5aO">It’s been four years since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21288478/pragmata-capcom-playstation-ps5-sony-event-announcement-release-date-price">Capcom revealed <em>Pragmata</em></a> at Sony’s big unveiling of the PlayStation 5. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789371/pragmata-release-date-delayed-2023-capcom"><em>Pragmata</em>’s been delayed</a> several times since then, and the last we heard about it was when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23758701/pragmata-release-date-capcom-showcase">Capcom pushed it back indefinitely</a>. Is <em>Pragmata</em> joining the increasingly long list of games coming in 2025? It’s starting to feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="XtHbHm"><strong>Rare’s Everwild</strong></h2>
<div id="zoQzfW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWpcUH-tKEU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="vIcvfs">We’re nearing the five-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965184/rare-everwild-game-announced-xbox-one-windows-pc-x019"><em>Everwild</em>’s unveiling</a>. Eighteen months later, we learned that developer Rare had <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22533819/everwild-rare-reboot-delay-xbox-series-x-pc-report">reportedly rebooted the game</a> with “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction.” Frankly, we just want to find out what <em>Everwild </em>even <em>is </em>— especially since Rare has proven that given the right development resources, it can turn good games into great games.</p>
<h2 id="ZS9mz2"><strong>Transformers: Reactivate</strong></h2>
<div id="St09h0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="C6NNlM">Call me an idealist, but I’m always willing to give a Transformers game the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes you get an unexpected surprise — a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/10/8/9476405/transformers-devastation-review"><em>Transformers: Devastation</em></a>, if you will. So when Splash Damage teased <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> in 2022 with a moody cover of Bon Jovi’s “Dead or Alive,” I was immediately on board. But we haven’t heard much about the cooperative online action game since, and that’s a shame. I’ve been in transform-and-roll-out mode for the past 18 months and I’m <em>concerned</em>.</p>
<h2 id="PbYgIq"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></h2>
<div id="Ckn0qd"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S--lFTxAVs8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rgf8no"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/10/22168765/perfect-dark-game-awards-reveal-reboot-xbox-trailer-initiative">Announced at 2020’s The Game Awards</a>, developer The Initiative’s <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot promised to revive a long-dormant franchise and serve as a cornerstone of the Xbox Series X’s lineup of game exclusives. But the studio and owner Microsoft have said very little about their new <em>Perfect Dark</em> and what we can expect from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23681047/female-james-bond-alias-kim-possible-perfect-dark">Joanna Dark</a>’s return. We continue to wait for it, alongside Xbox Game Studios’ <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Contraband</em>, <em>Fable</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, and <em>State of Decay 3</em>. </p>
<h2 id="2aSy5Y"><strong>Kingdom Hearts 4</strong></h2>

<p id="G16i8F">We’re now two years out from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23018966/kingdom-hearts-4-announcement-trailer-release-date">announcement of <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em></a>, a reveal timed to the Square Enix-Disney role-playing game franchise’s 20th anniversary. It increasingly looks like we’ll have to wait for Kingdom Hearts’ 25th birthday to actually get our hands on Sora’s next adventure. Given how long it’s taken Square Enix to realize its Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy — to say nothing of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22456431/dragon-quest-12-announced-dq3-remake-treasures-keshi">next mainline Dragon Quest game</a> — we don’t actually expect to see <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em> showing up any time soon. There’s a painful dose of reality.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-series-seasons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hbo%E2%80%99s-the-last-of-us-season-2-will-be-7-episodes-in-length-season-3-4-hinted.890661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-series-seasons/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new interview with Deadline, HBO’s The Last of Us showrunners &nbsp;Craig Mazin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Neil Druckmann have given significant updates to the series, including a hint of season 4.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, it was first revealed that The Last of Us Season 2 would have seven episodes total, but the showrunners implied that the third season would be “significantly bigger.”</p>



<p>“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”</p>



<div><p>Maxin continued, “We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons [2 and 3] because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in Season 1 too.”</p><p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that — as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television — Season 3 will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he concluded.</p></div>



<p>So there you have it; it does seem that as long as the interest and viewership are still there, we could be heading for four seasons total for HBO’s The Last of Us. Of course, many will speculate on what that means for a significant character death from the game (spoilers ahead).</p>



<p>To us, at least, we think that Joel (portrayed by Pedro Pascal) is likely to stick around until at least the premiere of Season 3. It seems logical to keep his star power around, and a nice cliffhanger in the Season 2 finale will surely keep people eagerly awaiting the Season 3 premiere. Or of course, they might just go down a different route entirely and decide that Season 3’s finale is where Joel will meet his end.</p>



<p>Either way, we’ll have to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2 in 2025</a> to find out!</p>



<p>What do you think of The Last of Us having at least four seasons? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wonder Woman Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2021</p>
      </div>
<p>Just days after the podcast, Monolith has announced it's hiring. Specifically, the studio is looking for someone to fill the role of lead gameplay engineer--a fact that could lend credence to Miller's claims. The role of lead gameplay engineer requires quite a bit of experience, and saddles whoever takes the position with a large amount of responsibility as far as the game's development goes. That Monolith (which has been developing the Wonder Woman Game since at least 2021, if not earlier) is looking to fill such a pivotal role this late in the game could simply suggest its previous occupant got a higher-paying job offer at another studio, or simply felt ill-equipped for the role and left of their own volition. But it could also be a reflection of how well the game's development is (or isn't) coming along.</p><p dir="ltr">Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first unveiled at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-teased-during-the-game-awards-from-monolith/1100-6498851/">The Game Awards in 2021</a>. Although fans of the iconic heroine were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-we-want-to-see-at-the-game-awards-2023-spot-on/1100-6519639/">hoping to catch another glimpse of her</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2023-winners-revealed/2900-4977/">2023's award ceremony</a>, no information was revealed. In fact, the only other update we have on the state of the Wonder Woman game is Monolith's confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-isnt-live-service-despite-recent-job-listing/1100-6519317/">it will not be a live-service title</a>--a rumor that started last year due to a different Monolith job posting. As such, any unverifiable information on the state of the game ought to be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) is the sunnier annual speedrunning event that follows <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/agdq-2024-start-this-weekend-here-are-some-runs-you-may-want-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, which usually takes place earlier in the year. The event sees runners worldwide come together to show off exactly how fast they can beat their favorite games and is, quite frankly, ludicrous. </p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">SGDQ 2024 is a fantastic event because it’s timed perfectly. It begins at the end of June after all the big conferences have finished, and<em> Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC has ripped us all apart. It’s a great way to pull yourself back together and prepare for the summer by watching games get systematically taken apart while raising money for charity. This year’s event promises to be just as incredible as previous years, so you won’t want to miss it. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-and-where-to-watch-summer-games-done-quick-2024" data-injectable="false">When and where to watch Summer Games Done Quick 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SGDQ</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><strong>Summer Games Done Quick begins on June 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM EST and runs until the early morning of July 7, 2024</strong>. The end time is likely to shift a little based on how long certain speedruns take and if any bonus runs are achieved through donations. </p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">The best place to watch the event is on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDQ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the most reliable stream will be hosted, with every run eventually being cut up from the stream and posted as an individual video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDQ YouTube channel</a>. Given how much easier it’s become to stream on YouTube and Twitch simultaneously, I’d wager that you’ll be able to catch the stream on YouTube, too, so keep an eye out around the period the event is live. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Speedruns to look out for in Summer Games Done Quick 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Games Done Quick</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Every SGDQ has its highlights, but before 2024’s event, I want to highlight a few games you should tune in for if you can’t watch the whole thing. Make sure you check out the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full schedule</a> to find all the games you want to see a runner blast through as quickly as possible. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">First is <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> on June 30, 2024, at about 9:50 PM EST. This series is notorious for having tricky speedruns with many pixel-perfect moves, but the first game in the series is definitely the most interesting and toughest to master. There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqS-ohYDedk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrific video</a> on some of the speedrunning tech that’s been used in the game over the years, including an unsolved mystery that would blow the game wide open. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ratchet &amp; Clank's Unsolved Mystery" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vqS-ohYDedk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">The next game to watch is <em>Silent Hill</em> on July 1, 2024, at 8 AM EST. Survival horror games are always fun to watch a speedrunner smash their way through, but it doesn’t get better than the original <em>Silent Hill</em>. Seeing the game played in a way that effectively makes it a boss rush mode is hilarious. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">On July 2, 2024, at 3 AM EST, you can watch a 100% run of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/games-that-time-forgot-metroid-fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Fusion</a></em> that takes less than 2 hours. I adore the <em>Metroid</em> games, but this one has a special place in my heart. This speedrun promises to be educational, too, because the runner will have to collect everything for Samus in the game. </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">On the same day, at 10:40 PM EST, you can see <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dishonored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dishonored</a></em> completed in just 30 minutes. This game is incredibly broken and it’s so fun to watch just how easily you could skip most of its content if you employ just a few tricks. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Lastly, at 10:40 PM EST on July 6, 2024, treat yourself to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-ps5-port-impressions-couch-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em> Honor Mode glitchless run. This is slated to take just one hour, which sounds insane to me. I can’t wait to see how the runner achieves such a short time in a game that took me almost 100 hours to finish. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-come-with-a-catch.890649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesnt-come-with-a-catch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesnt-come-with-a-catch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="180" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The JAK Requiem aftermarket part for the Kastov 762 and Kastov 545 eliminates most vertical recoil, and vaults both weapons into meta contention, despite having a slight tradeoff. </p> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">By completing the second week of challenges in Season 4, players unlock the JAK Requiem Conversion Kit, which improves vertical recoil by 100 percent, horizontal recoil by 86 percent, and recoil gun kick by 50 percent. With the attachment equipped on the Kastov 762 or Kastov 545, you can fire the weapon straight without adjusting the right thumb stick. Before players pull out their torches and pitchforks, there is a noteworthy trade-off to prevent the attachment from being too overpowered. </p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1798400317526102463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Meta</a> tested the change on the Kastov 545 and concluded that its time-to-kill speed from zero to 18 meters is 670 milliseconds and 765 milliseconds from 18 to 48 meters. Without the attachment, those values change to 644 up to 18 meters and 736 meters from 18 to 48 meters. Even though there is a tradeoff, the time-to-kill difference won’t be enough to prevent the Kastov 545 from becoming one of the most popular weapons in the battle royale. </p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here is the best Kastov 545 loadout to pair with this new aftermarket part. </p> <h2 id="h-best-kastov-545-loadout-in-warzone-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Kastov 545 loadout in <em>Warzone </em>Season 4 </h2> <figure data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>  <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Sonic Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong> JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>7.62x39mm High Grain Rounds </li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Conversion Kit: </strong>JAK Requiem </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">Using a <strong>60-round magazine</strong> is essential for any Kastov 545 loadout. Having more ammunition to take down multiple enemies at once before reloading will save you on more than one occasion. The <strong>Sonic Suppressor L</strong> and <strong>7.62x39mm High Grain Rounds</strong> compensate for the JAK Requiem by compensating for the lost bullet velocity and damage range. Choosing an optic comes down to personal preference, but the <strong>JAK Glassless</strong> optic provides one of the best sight lines for short to medium-range engagements. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-let-team-fortress-2-rot-and-they-should-feel-bad-about-it.890643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have seen few games sink as low as <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. Once the crown jewel of Valve, these days its public servers are unplayable, filled to the brim with racist aimbot snipers spamming mics. This begs the question: how did Valve fuck up so badly? How did one of the biggest companies on Earth drop the ball on a beloved game for several years? And why should I ever trust Valve with a live service game ever again?</p><figure><figcaption>Hey, is that bad? Credit: Valve.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s bot problem is not new. It goes back at least five years, and the company has functionally done nothing to address it. The bot harassment has even extended outside of the game:<a href="https://www.404media.co/team-fortress-2-bot-hosters-use-ai-voice-to-defame-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As 404 reported</a> today, bot creators have gone so far as to clone the voice of critics like YouTuber megascatterbomb to say vile stuff in-game. In addition there has been doxxing, swatting and impersonating people to frame them as pedophiles, according to a document compiled by YouTuber TheWhat. It has gotten so bad that the community is <a href="https://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushing a petition</a> to review-bomb the game so that Valve will do something. This is not the first time: Two years ago, Valve claimed it was listening to player complaints. That was the last update from the <em>Team Fortress</em> Twitter account, and since then things have only gotten worse.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The last update</a> on the Team Fortress Twitter account. Readers have recently added context. Credit: X/Twitter.</figcaption></figure><p>This situation would be unfortunate but slightly more understandable if Valve was a smaller company without manpower or resources, but it’s Valve. It owns Steam, and Gabe is loaded. I don’t want to diminish the efforts of any people working on this problem, but considering it has been half a decade now, it’s also reasonable for players to assume that Valve as a company is not actively trying. I have always found the company’s bizarre, freshman libertarian, flat hierarchy to be annoying and confusing, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9aCwCKgkLo?si=3vq9VnSUpAd4kdzn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that is massively flawed in practice</a>. Something is clearly broken if you can have a game this high profile be non-functional for this long.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="What's It Really like Working at Valve? We Found Out." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9aCwCKgkLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I highly recommend the People Make Games documentary on the internal company structure of Valve.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The gamers’ rights <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-psn-login-steam-review-bomb-arrowhead-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing</a> schtick is too often over-applied and a tiny bit overbearing, but the community is correct here. These aren’t unreasonable demands being levied against a tiny or flailing company; this is a total failure to do the bare minimum. And it’s on a product that cosmetics are still being sold for, that is still on the market. It feels like you shouldn’t be able to sell items on a game that doesn’t really work.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Meet the Heavy" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHgZh4GV9G0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This is more important to me than the Mona Lisa. </figcaption></figure></div><p>That would be bad if this game wasn’t universally loved, but <em>Team Fortress 2</em> was! Source Filmmaker is one of the most culturally significant pieces of software to come out in the last few years, and entire swaths of animation wouldn’t exist without it. I used to eagerly await the regular updates in the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHy7G7ndrUmpWqBkNKjJRT5urGiPW63Iq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Meet The Team</em></a>” series. <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is a load-bearing piece of culture and gaming history, and it’s been left to decay in the sun. And that’s shameful given that Valve built its reputation on the&nbsp; game. Gabe is a billionaire, the least you could do is give the Heavy Weapons Guy a pension.</p><p>Even if nothing happens, which seems to be in the realm of possibility, what does that say about Valve’s commitment to supporting its other products? <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s age is no excuse for this level of public neglect. What confidence should anyone have in Valve games going forward? Why would I invest any meaningful time in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159222/valve-new-game-deadlock-multiplayer-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a> if it’s going to just end up like this?&nbsp;<br>Above all, this just bums me out. I had a lot of great times in <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, as a game it means a lot to me. Seeing it in this state is like seeing an old friend waste away. It’s preventable and needless, a problem that no company of this scale should have this much difficulty fixing. And Valve–not any individuals toiling away on the project, but the entire company collectively–should be deeply embarrassed that it has come to this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24171525/world-of-warcraft-thrall-lore-the-war-within-fan-reaction</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-fans-are-worried-about-the-game%E2%80%99s-saddest-shaman.890613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171525/world-of-warcraft-thrall-lore-the-war-within-fan-reaction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Asxf2B">Thrall has a long and storied history in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft">Warcraft,</a> starting as a humble slave and gladiator, rising to become Warchief of the Horde, and eventually using his shaman power to defeat Deathwing alongside the Dragon Aspects. He’s one of the main characters of the franchise, as well as one of the most popular ones, plus he’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511393/world-of-warcraft-chris-metzen-creative-advisor-blizzard">voiced by Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen</a>. With <em>The War Within</em> expansion entering beta, Thrall is one of the protagonists stepping up to save Azeroth — but fans are concerned that he’s just spinning his wheels on the same old narrative.</p>
<p id="jXrBCf">As a character, Thrall united the modern-day Horde under one banner, founded the city of Orgrimmar, managed diplomacy with factions like the Forsaken and the Blood Elves, and helped lead the war against the Lich King. It was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/11/3/23945447/wow-classic-cataclysm-season-of-discovery-blizzcon-2023">during the <em>Cataclysm </em>expansion</a> that things got weird; the arrival of Deathwing threw the world into chaos, and as a shaman, Thrall felt obligated to help. It’s hard to moonlight as the head of a major political coalition and save the world from a dragon, so Thrall retired and put Garrosh Hellscream in his place. </p>
<p id="heHRRx">Garrosh was a bad pick, and he ended up serving as the final boss of the <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansion. Both factions had to storm Orgrimmar and stop Garrosh, putting him on trial for all sorts of war crimes. Unfortunately, Garrosh escaped to an alternate universe to cause more chaos — that’s how the <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> expansion came to be. Thrall put Vol’jin in charge of the Horde, headed to Draenor, pursued Garrosh, and murdered him. But that wasn’t as cathartic as he may have hoped, as Garrosh brought up Thrall’s negligence in appointing him to such a high position and promptly leaving him alone to fail. Thrall was so upset about the whole thing that he lost his connection to the elements and ultimately retired to a farm on Outland.</p>

<p id="P9In9m">But Thrall is perhaps too popular to shelve forever, and so he came back during <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> and adventured through the realms of death in <em>Shadowlands</em>. He’s now featured prominently in the key art for <em>The War Within</em>, and in early promos about the upcoming expansion, we’ve learned... that he’s still struggling with his connection to the elements. This plot thread is reinforced with some dialogue from Jaina in <em>The War Within</em> content; she worries about Thrall and his ability to cope without his elemental powers.</p>
<p id="WTYNmf"><em>Warlords of Draenor</em> is 10 years old, and while Thrall’s <a href="https://x.com/BaalTheWarlock/status/1797696068475629912">elemental dysfunction</a> is somewhat understandable — and it makes sense to focus on inner conflict during a story about a “war within” — I am so tired of Thrall having this specific problem. As one fan put it on X, “Thrall started grappling with his connection to the elements when I was in middle school. I’m now pursuing a Master’s degree, and Thrall is grappling with his connection to the elements.”</p>
<div id="mJUU6k">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thrall started grappling with his connection to the elements when I was in middle school. I’m now pursuing a Master’s degree, and Thrall is grappling with his connection to the elements.</p><p>How are we *still* doing this plotline lmao <a href="https://t.co/BN0bTUPaEe">https://t.co/BN0bTUPaEe</a></p></div>— Portergauge  ️‍  (@Portergauge) <a href="https://twitter.com/Portergauge/status/1796071965893243124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="RE7TY5">It’s possible we’ll see more variation in Thrall’s story in future <em>The War Within</em> updates; the beta is for testing, after all. Right now, it seems that fans are at best concerned for Thrall and wondering how they can help get him out of this funk, and at worst utterly bored with the idea of dealing with another confidence issue from our big green friend. Thrall is one of the only main characters right now with strong ties to the Horde, so it’d be neat to see more of Thrall the diplomat or Thrall the leader. Fans are worried, as we head into the first expansion in the World Soul Saga, that we’re more likely to get Thrall the Mope. Again, though, this is just a beta, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23770396/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-fractures-in-time-ptr-alexstrasza-quest">content on test realms is always subject to change</a>. Blizzard has done a much better job in writing villains over the course of <em>Dragonflight</em>; it remains to be seen whether it can find interesting paths for its heroes as well.</p>

Jake Lucky <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a snazzy video</a></span> of the skin in action so that everybody can stare in awe (or disgust) at how much money a person paid for it.

With no sale of that rare knife skin, it remains to be seen if the astronomically high million-dollar record of this latest sale will be broken at some point in the future. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the help of some cursory currency conversions ($1 USD roughly equals $1.50 AUD), users believe they have a ballpark for how much Concord will cost gamers in the United States. </p><p>According to the Australian PlayStation Store listing, Concord — like with Helldivers 2 before it — will have a Standard and Digital Deluxe Edition that will run players roughly $59.95 and $94.95 Australian Dollars. In layman’s terms, Concord’s Standard and Deluxe edition price tags in the United States would be roughly $40 and $60, if directly converted to U.S. pricing. </p><p>IGN reached out to Sony for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Concord Gameplay Trailer Screenshots - State of Play 2024</h3></div></output><p>If that price does pan out, it seems that Sony would be taking a page from Helldivers 2's smash success, which had a similar asking price. It's little wonder, too, that Sony would want to follow Helldivers 2's example, considering the hit third-person shooter shot up the charts as<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"> PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> by selling over 12 million copies in its first 12 weeks. </p><p>Though, as ResetEra users point out, Helldivers 2's meteoric success is thanks in large part to word-of-mouth recommendations from players as well as its engrossing gameplay. This, coupled with Sony's lack of bigger PlayStation 5 exclusives, puts some pressure on Concord to recapture the same lightning-in-a-bottle appeal that Helldivers 2 did on launch, especially in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-gets-new-cinematic-and-gameplay-trailer-and-a-release-date-state-of-play-2024">Concord's extended showcase at the most recent Sony State of Play</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>During <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-the-first-game-from-developer-firewalk-studios">Concord's reveal at last year's State of Play</a>, Firewalk Studios game director Ryan Ellis said the 5v5 first-person shooter was designed to inspire social play. According to Ellis, players will be awaited by a new adventure every time they log in, and "every match is an opportunity for a new story." Time will tell whether Concord lives up to the hype.</p><p>Concord will release on August 23 for PlayStation 5 and PC. A pre-launch beta is planned for July sometime in July for both platforms. </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

Tags are user-generated, but the ones that appear first are the most popular among fans.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official 'The Truth Lies' Live Action Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2>Black Ops 6 Direct start time</h2><p>The Black Ops 6 Direct will be livestreamed on June 9 immediately after the Xbox Games Showcase. That event begins at the times listed below. There is no word on how long the briefing will be, but last year's show was about an hour long, so if that's similar this year, the Black Ops 6 Direct may start around 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h3><strong>Xbox Games Showcase start times:</strong></h3><p><em><strong>(Black Ops 6 Direct to follow immediately after)</strong></em></p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>6 PM BST</li><li>2 AM JST (June 10)</li><li>3 AM AEST (June 10)</li></ul><h2>How to watch the Black Ops 6 Direct</h2><p>You'll be able to catch the Black Ops 6 Direct from several official Xbox, Activision, and Bethesda channels across YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. Additionally, GameSpot will also host an embed of the stream to watch directly through this page.</p><p>Of note, the Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision streams on YouTube will air at up to 4K/60fps, while every other channel will be capped at 1080p/60fps.</p><p>Subtitle support will be provided in many languages, from Albanian to Zulu. We don't know how long the livestream will be yet, but these typically run for at least an hour.</p><ul><li><a href="http://youtube.com/Xbox">YouTube (Xbox channel)</a></li><li><a href="http://twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch (Xbox channel)</a></li><li><a href="http://twitch.tv/XboxASL">Twitch (American sign language)</a></li><li><a href="http://facebook.com/Xbox">Facebook (Xbox channel)</a></li><li><a href="http://youtube.com/Bethesda">YouTube (Bethesda channel)</a></li><li><a href="http://twitch.tv/Bethesda">Twitch (Bethesda channel)</a></li><li><a href="http://youtube.com/ActivisionGames">YouTube (Activision)</a></li></ul><h2>What to expect from Black Ops 6 Direct</h2><p>Activision has said the June 9 event will be the worldwide reveal for Black Ops 6, so fans are expecting a meaty segment. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/events/xbox-games-showcase" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official word</a> is that the Black Ops 6 Direct will provide a "deeper look into the next installment of the biggest action series of all time."</p><p>So far, Activision has only released brief and cryptic teasers, including a live-action video (see above). There has been no gameplay footage yet, though, so Activision could potentially have a lot to show and discuss. Back in the E3 days, Activision was known to release an extended campaign sequence as well as multiplayer, and fans are surely hoping for something similar this year with Black Ops 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4313437-screenshot2024-06-05at2.12.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4313437" data-ratio="0.55414012738854" data-width="1099" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4313437-screenshot2024-06-05at2.12.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4313437"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 will be officially revealed on June 9</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4313437-screenshot2024-06-05at2.12.17pm.png"></figure><p>The announcement event may also include the reveal of the game's release date, which is rumored to be sometime in October, along with potentially details on its special editions and more.</p><p>Many are also anticipating that the Black Ops 6 reveal event may include an announcement of older Call of Duty games coming to Game Pass. It remains to be seen if this may happen, though, or if an announcement may come prior during the main Xbox Games Showcase briefing. Time will tell.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is the first new entry in the series since Microsoft acquired Activision and the Call of Duty franchise. Despite the buyout, Microsoft will continue to release new Call of Duty games on PlayStation. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-a-long-strange-history-on-nintendo-consoles/1100-6509800/" data-ref-id="1100-6509800">signaled its intent to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo Switch</a>, and it'll be interesting to see if Microsoft shares any details on that during the Black Ops 6 Direct or Xbox Games Showcase. </p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-the-intransigent-warhammer-in-baldurs-gate-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-to-get-the-intransigent-warhammer-in-baldurs-gate-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Intransigent Warhammer in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is an early-game weapon you can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-act-1-checklist-and-all-main-quests-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use during Act One</a>. However, while the warhammer has pros and cons, it’s easy to miss as you explore, especially since you only have one opportunity to obtain it.</p> <h2 id="h-intransigent-warhammer-location-in-baldur-s-gate-3-bg3" data-injectable="false">Intransigent Warhammer location in Baldur’s Gate 3 (BG3)</h2> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">You can find the Intransigent Warhammer in a watertight chest after boarding the Underdark Duergar boat you use to arrive at the Grymforge. After arriving in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-to-the-underdark-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underdark’s Decrepit Village</a>, approach Ebonlake and board the boat to start a conversation with Corsair Greymon. Rather than deceiving or intimidating him into letting you go, attack him immediately to begin the fight, giving you access to the chest on the enemy’s ship.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">It’s worth creating a save before this point, as the following battle can end disastrously if your enemies land some lucky shoves. Fortunately, you can use this same attack to your advantage.</p>
 <h3 id="h-fighting-on-the-underdark-duergar-boat" data-injectable="false">Fighting on the Underdark Duergar boat</h3> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Once you start the fight, you’ll have multiple obstacles to face. The first is Greymon, who’ll appear immediately before your character, ready to strike. Shoving any character is an instant kill if they land in the water, so be careful not to let anyone push your party into Ebonlake. Instead, try to shove Greymon and the rest of his crew in whenever possible to get some easy kills before knocking out the rest with your regular attacks. Alternatively, you can use spells like Thunderwave to achieve the same outcome.</p>
 <h3 id="h-finding-the-watertight-chest-and-intransigent-warhammer" data-injectable="false">Finding the watertight chest and Intransigent Warhammer</h3> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">After you clear out some enemies, make your way to the opposing Duergar ship to find the watertight chest at the top of some steps. Having a high-strength character like Lae’zel to jump over is your best bet, but otherwise, you can use spells or potions to increase your jump range. </p> <figure data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Once you reach the other ship, head up the steps and open the watertight chest. Inside, you’ll find the Intransigent Warhammer alongside some coins. Pick it up and claim it for yourself before eliminating the rest of the Duergar enemies and activating your boat’s rudder to either head back to the Underdark or arrive in the Grymforge.</p> <h2 id="h-intransigent-warhammer-stats-in-bg3" data-injectable="false">Intransigent Warhammer stats in BG3</h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">The Intransigent Warhammer is an uncommon weapon that, although it doesn’t have much higher damage stats than your typical warhammer, has a perk that knocks enemies prone with critical hits and fatal attacks. More specifically, you’ll knock nearby enemies prone after killing hostile creatures or landing a critical hit. </p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Although you likely won’t be using it in the late game, you can find some interesting practical uses for knocking enemies prone as your other party members throw spells on their stunned bodies. While it’s best suited for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-saves-recruit-laezel-later-in-act-1-bg3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters like Lae’zel</a>, any tanky party member with warhammer-wielding proficiency can benefit from this passive effect.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The second Early Access patch for <em>Hades 2 </em>has arrived to the slam of a Volcanic Strike. It brings many changes, from full weapon rebalance to Aspect reworks and more. Some Daedalus Hammers have been replaced, and the final fight may be less annoying. Or, maybe not?</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Developer Supergiant Games dropped the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hades 2</em> Patch 2 notes</a> yesterday. Many changes are pretty hefty, meaning you’ll probably experience a noticeably different <em>Hades 2</em> from here on out. All five weapons got buffed, which is great. So, too, did Selene’s Hexes, which I’ve <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-path-of-stars-and-upgrades-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">championed for a while now</a>. But now they’re even better! Hopefully, the doubters will finally give Selene the chance she deserves.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hades-2-patch-2-changes-affect-weapons-aspects-and-icons" data-injectable="false"><em>Hades 2</em> Patch 2 changes affect weapons, Aspects, and icons</h2> <h3 id="h-weapons-and-aspects" data-injectable="false">Weapons and Aspects</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Every weapon in <em>Hades 2</em> received a buff with Patch 2. A few of the changes are fairly minor: The Sister Blades’ stagger lasts longer against enemies, and the Witch’s Staff Omega Special charges faster. The Moonstone Axes’ Omega Special attack now gives Melinoe a lingering barrier so she doesn’t eat damage while charging it up. </p> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">But the one that got the most attention is undoubtedly the Umbral Flames. Yes, the weapon may finally be useful. The update boosts and speeds up its attacks and now lets you move while channeling the Omega Special. </p>

The Aspect of Melinoë on the Moonstone Axe adds Power and Life, while the Umbral Flames’ Aspect of Eos copies your Special move and fires a slow shot that blasts enemies. </p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">But again, the Wands get a major change: The Aspect of Momus has been completely replaced. Using an Omega move with Momus will fire said move a few times in the place it was cast until you use it again. Some in the community predicted the change to Momus, as the Aspect was viewed as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1ctpbd9/32_fear_is_pretty_easy_with_aspect_of_redacted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit broken</a> when combined with the Daedalus Hammer upgrade, Double Moonshot. </p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, several Daedalus Hammer upgrades have been replaced. Double Wallop is gone, swapped out for Wicked Thrasher, which grants bonus Power to all attacks.

In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.</p>

<p>There are no end of Baldur’s Gate 3 mods to find out there to satisfy your every desire to tweak the game’s visuals, gameplay and more - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-sort-of-turns-it-into-dragon-age-origins">even make it an entirely different game altogether</a>. To date, those mods have been crafted by enterprising creators finding their own way to play around with the game’s files, but developers Larian plan to throw open the doors so that anyone can create a killer salami sword and mess around with your party’s fashion choices.</p>
<p>Official mod support will come to Baldur’s Gate 3 in September, the studio announced, expanding the existing (but unofficial) implementation of third-party mods with proper support that aims to smooth out the risks of instability or incompatibility. Larian are quick to reassure that their official mod.io platform won’t replace support for other third-party mods - for example, those that use more complex scripts, veer too far away from the game’s official D&amp;D licence or, ahem, are too NSFW to pass official moderation - but will sit alongside the manual approach as a more user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>“We understand and appreciate the hard work and dedication of the modding community, and have no plans to limit modding to our official pipeline,” Larian wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452">their blog post</a> detailing the plans. “We are committed to supporting the modding community as comprehensively as we can, and can’t wait to see what ideas you bring to life!”</p>

<p>The incoming toolkit will include a dedicated mod editor, level tester and in-game mod browser, built on the studio’s own development tools to allow creators to mess around with things like textures and models. (The official mod platform also means PC-made mods should then be usable on console.)</p>
<p>While the mod tools will roll out to everyone later this year, Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 7 is already being tested with a small set of mod makers in a limited alpha test ahead of the wider release. In July, that test pool will be expanded again with a closed beta open to anyone via 1,000 additional sign-up spots.</p>
<p>As well as the mod tools, Larian teased that they’re working on a photo mode, crossplay and additional fixes for future updates, along with some “anniversary extravagance” to mark a year since the game’s full release in August.</p>

					<p>MultiVersus has got to be the textbook example of how even the most recognizable properties don't guarantee the success of a live service game. Launched in open beta back in July 2022, complete with microtransactions, the platform fighter developed by Player First Game was abruptly&nbsp;taken down <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-open-beta-to-end-on-june-25-game-to-launch-better-than-ever-in-early-2024/">the following year</a>. While the dwindling number of players since launch may have played a part in taking the game offline, the developer assured that MultiVersus would be coming back in 2024 better than ever with a lot of changes based on player feedback.</p>
<p>MultiVersus is now back online and apparently out of beta, but I'm having a hard time considering this version of the game as the first, proper 1.0 version. Rather, it feels like this is a beta version of another vision for the platform fighter, a vision where, sadly, the bad currently outweighs the good.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240530131752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At its heart, the latest version of MultiVersus is not that different from the game we played in 2022 and 2023. Taking more than a few pages from the Super Smash Bros. series' book, the game is a platform fighter where players must knock out of a stage their opponents with a focus on 2 versus 2 gameplay and a diverse roster of characters lifted from Warner Bros. properties. Stages are as varied as the playable cast, inspired by iconic locations such as the Batcave, the Red Keep's throne room from Game of Thrones, and many others.</p>
<p>Once again, the diverse roster of characters and stages are the highlights of the experience, thanks to their excellent design. Characters, for example, are quite varied, and their movesets take full advantage of their unique quirks. Tom and Jerry are very technical fighters who can put together some nasty setups, and Batman can use some of his most iconic gadgets to control the flow of battle. Some of the new additions to the roster over the beta, like the Joker, Jason from Friday the 13th, and Banana Guard from Adventure Time, are just as well designed as the previously released cast, their movesets full of references that the most hardcore fans won't fail to recognize.</p>
<p>With the exception of Support characters, who were reworked into the other classes, the characters from the beta play pretty much the same, retaining most of their moveset. Despite this, the game did not feel natural at first due to some big gameplay changes, such as the much slower pace of combat. This change was clearly made to improve screen readability and prevent games from becoming a chaotic mess like they often did in the beta, but I cannot help but feel that slowing things down this much wasn't a great decision. With a slower speed, combat should have felt weightier, but this isn't the case here, mostly due to the animations and a certain "stickiness" that makes them feel really slow. The general floatiness that put me off in the beta wasn't addressed at all, making air combat feel so unsatisfying compared to the Smash series. Thankfully, damage over 100 points greatly increases knockback, making it much easier to score knockouts over the beta, where I felt games dragged on too much, especially in 1v1.</p>
<p>Another element of the combat that really put me off in the beta, the Perks, which grant characters a variety of bonuses, have been slightly reworked, and although they don't feel that crucial anymore, I still think they should be disabled in any sort of competitive mode. As online play is currently limited to casual matchmaking, hopefully, Player First Games will do away with them in ranked mode, although I am not too hopeful since it wasn't the case in the beta. The zoomed-in camera is another change over the beta I would have happily done without, as it doesn't provide a very good view of the stage. The colored outlines, on the other, do feel distracting but they are definitely helpful in team matches to easily keep track of your companion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240530132436_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gameplay changes, however, are not the reason I feel MultiVersus is still in beta. Over the previous version, the current one lacks some essential features, such as no leaderboards, no after-battle report, advanced tutorials in training mode, the inability to change controller settings in the training room, and more. The worst offender, however, has got to be the inability to try out characters that haven't been purchased in training mode and local play. This seems like a major oversight, considering that every character costs the same amount of Gleamium and Fighter Currency. The latter can be obtained, albeit slowly, by playing the game, but the player should still be allowed to try out a character before purchasing, given the money and time investment.</p>
<p>The multiple currencies, which also include Perk Currency to unlock Perks and Prestige Currency used to unlock rare cosmetics, are only a small part of the free-to-play trappings that suck the joy out of MultiVersus. There isn't a single time you aren't constantly reminded of the multiple currencies, Missions, Battle Passes, and microtransactions, and I can't help but find this extremely offputting. The convoluted main menu doesn't exactly help either, having been designed more to accommodate these constant "reminders" than to feel functional, in my opinion. Making matters worse is how the free-to-play mechanics don't feel fair at all. Battle Pass experience, for example, is only obtained after completing Missions, so progression stops after clearing all of the available ones. To make another example, you need to master around 10 different characters to obtain enough Fighter Currency to purchase one character, not counting any currency obtained by completing Missions.</p>
<p>Alongside the gameplay changes and new additions to the roster, the latest version of MultiVersus introduces Rifts, a single-player mode that features a variety of different combat scenarios and mini-games, as well as different difficulty levels to put your skills to the test. These Rifts, unfortunately, are not particularly engaging, as the skeleton of a story they feature isn't particularly great, and the combat scenarios and minigames tend to become stale fast. Hopefully, future Rifts will address these issues and become a fun side activity to participate in when one's not in the mood for online matches.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240531123733_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, MultiVersus only features casual matchmaking for 1v1 and 2v2 at the time of writing. Without skill-based matchmaking, players of all skill levels are getting matched together, which doesn't always translate into a good experience. The game's rollback netcode is not the best either, as there's some noticeable input delay even when the action appears smooth. Servers, sadly, are still under pressure, so having a smooth match is an exception as of now. Wi-Fi and rollback frame indicators would have improved the online experience, especially in 2v2, as a bad internet connection is obviously more impactful than in 1v1.</p>

<p>Given how MultiVersus has only just been released, and things will obviously get tweaked in the future, it is difficult to score the game in its current state. While the free-to-play trappings are unlikely to change, tweaks and additional content could deeply improve the experience in the long term, making it a worthy rival to Super Smash Bros. and other popular platform fighting games. As of now, however, I feel much of the potential of MultiVersus is still untapped, and it will be up to Player First Game to let the seed they have planted bloom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-editions-preorder/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Concord was revealed just a few days ago at the State of Play showcase, and gamers worldwide immediately found issues with the ‘hero-shooter fatigue’ that’s running rampant. In a nutshell, Concord looks like a cross between Overwatch and Guardians of the Galaxy, and the five-vs-five multiplayer-based operating system probably won’t move mountains anytime soon.</p>



<p>Recently, the editions of Concord available to pre-order surfaced on the PlayStation store, showcasing the bonuses you’ll receive for securing the highest edition of this upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>Concord has been in development for quite some time. It’s the debut title from Firewalk Studios, and for years, prospective fans didn’t know what to expect from the project. Now that it has been revealed in full, we know exactly what it’ll look like – but the game has proven to be divisive thus far.</p>



<p>There are two editions of the game available for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-order on the PlayStation store</a>: Standard and Digital Deluxe. </p>



<p>If you opt for the standard game, all you’ll get is just that – <strong>the game</strong>. Presently, it’s sitting with a price tag of $59.95 AUD ($40 US), which is to be expected. However, gamers interested in picking up a little more bang for their buck can secure the Digital Deluxe Edition for $94.95 AUD ($60 USD), which comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Full Base Game</li>



<li>16 Character Skins</li>



<li>72-Hours Early Access</li>



<li>‘Monarch’ Pack</li>
</ul>



<p>It was also referenced that all pre-orders will get access to the game’s beta, which goes live in July, just a few weeks before the full game is released toward the end of August.</p>

<p>The claims come from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">Dealabs’ Billbil-kun</a>, who has accurately reported similar news around PlayStation PC ports in the past - including the news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-quarry-devs-horror-hit-until-dawn-is-reportedly-the-next-playstation-exclusive-headed-to-pc">the Until Dawn PC release</a>. According to the reliable leaker, a PC version of The Last of Us 2 has been in the works since at least 2021 - and, most intriguingly, reportedly finished development in last November or earlier.</p>
<p>While there’s no word on whether a Last of Us 2 release on PC would be based on the remaster of the former PS4 exclusive, it seems extremely likely. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">The Last of Us Part I</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-resurrects-on-pc-on-march-3rd-2023">arrived on PC in March of last year</a>, six months after its own remastered re-release of the game formerly known as just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> on PS5. That remaster tuned up gameplay elements such as AI and improved visuals for things like lighting, along with adding brand new modes for speedrunning and permadeath. That said, the gap between Part 2’s original release and its remaster was notably shorter, so the leaps in visual improvements and such were a bit less drastic.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/last-of-us-2-remastered-abby-alley.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony/Naughty Dog</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Last of Us Part II’s own remaster came to PS5 at the start of this year - meaning that the wait on a PC release may be down to giving the console version a bit of breathing room, hence the wait despite development supposedly being wrapped. Billbil-kun suggested that Part 2’s PC release might not arrive all the way until next year, launching alongside the second season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">acclaimed live-action HBO adaptation</a> - which will adapt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forget-two-seasons-the-last-of-us-tv-show-co-creator-wants-at-least-three">at least part of</a> the sequel’s fairly brutal story.</p>
<p>With no official word from Sony just yet - and no sign of The Last of Us during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play</a> showcase - we’ll have to wait and see for now. With so many PlayStation exclusives finding their way to PC, it seems a given that The Last of Us 2 will cross over at some point. Expect to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">need to sign in with a PlayStation account</a> when it does, mind.</p>

			<p>With Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios produced its first science fiction IP and decided to make a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-gameplay-revealed-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a thousand explorable planets</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-has-100-planets-10-of-total-with-life-on-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 of which with life on them</a>) to sell the idea of a proper space adventure.</p>
<p>To do so, the developers of Starfield had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensively employ procedural generation</a>, which Bethesda had used in some capacity ever since Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. That game featured over fifteen thousand cities, villages, towns, and dungeons, with a playable area estimated at around 161 thousand square kilometers (real-life Great Britain is 209K square kilometers).</p>
<p>Some of the developers behind Daggerfall are now making a spiritual successor called The Wayward Realms, currently on a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> for funding ahead of an early access debut slated in 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent interview with Wccftech</a>, the developers at OnceLost Games shared their belief that Starfield would have benefited from sticking more closely to the Daggerfall procedural generation formula, especially for dungeons.</p>
<p><em>Starfield was enjoyable but took a different approach to procedural generation from ours. We feel it would have benefited from having some Daggerfall-esque “dungeon” generation instead of reusing premade dungeons.</em></p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A, the developers of The Wayward Realms also explained how they plan to advance procedural generation in their game, which will not feature a traditional main quest.</p>
<p><em>We feel that there are plenty of ways to advance the procedural generation and integrate more memorable interactions and encounters within it.</em><br>
<em>We are also taking advantage of procedural generation in order to be able to change things within the world, such as a town being burned down to the ground as a result of the political struggle.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is meant to work like a real life tabletop game master would, tailoring the game around the player, who/what they are playing as, and what they enjoy doing. For instance, a player who collects books may be offered more quests with books as a reward to entice them. Meanwhile, a melee-focused player may be offered more challenges based on their melee skills. The idea is to track what the player is doing and avoid offering more of what the player is not doing.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is also in charge of creating new quests for players, taking into account recent events, NPCs that the player has interacted with, and what factions the player is allied with and against in order to fill in the variables in potential quests. This helps make the game more relevant to the player in each playthrough.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no main quest, but we do have major World Events that occur throughout a playthrough. They act as sort of an overarching narrative. There are also questlines for each of the major factions. With both of these there will be a sort of finality to a narrative for players, but they can continue to play one beyond them, and the VGM will continue to create new adventures for the player to experience</em>.</p>
<p>Do you agree with OnceLost that Starfield should have stuck to the Daggerfall formula when making procedurally generated dungeons? Let us know below.</p>

<p>I want more of The Last of Us. I realize the second game brought about controversy, but the first game, specifically the story between Ellie and Joel, remains one of my most cherished gaming memories. I’m open to the sequel on PC. But when is The Last of Us Part 2 coming to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-release-date">Do We Know The Last of Us Part 2 PC Release Date?</h2>



<p>According to recent claims, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-port-under-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>, the PC port of The Last of Us Part 2 is under development and began sometime in 2021. Allegedly, the game’s development concluded in November 23, meaning PlayStation is sitting on the port until it’s ready for a launch.</p>



<p>Seeing as we saw nothing about the project at State of Play, there’s a chance they’re withholding the sequel’s PC port until the next season of the television series. If that’s the case, it may be another year before we see The Last of Us Part 2 on PC.</p>



<p>We don’t have a release date for The Last of Us Part 2 on PC yet. When we do, we’ll update this article to ensure you know as soon as possible!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">What About The Last of Us Season 2?</h2>



<p>There was supposedly a delay to the upcoming The Last of Us season two following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. However, we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-two-casting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous casting choices</a> made for the second season of the live-action adaptation. These casting choices include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kaitlyn Dever (Abby)</li>



<li>Isabela Merced (Dina)</li>



<li>Danny Ramirez (Manny)</li>



<li>Ariela Barer (Mel)</li>



<li>Tati Gabrielle (Nora)</li>



<li>Spencer Lord (Owen)</li>
</ul>



<p>Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay will reprise their roles as Joel and Ellie, respectively, for the series’ second season.</p>

Movie.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of all the developers, Nintendo may have found the most ideal Hollywood relationship. Compared to other companies, it’s more deliberate with what gets adapted and how, mainly because of the trauma of the near-universally panned 1993 Mario movie. But it ended up working out in the long run. Two Mario games came out in 2023, and neither were made in relation to the then-upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. Because Nintendo was so involved during its production, the movie works as “just another Mario game” instead of something the entire franchise is dependent on. That same feeling may extend to the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie: if a game (new or remake) comes out in the same relative proximity, it’ll feel like a natural intersection instead of predetermined steering.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the ever-growing Pokemon anime series and movies, Nintendo practically created transmedia as we now know it. The often annual games serve as the foundation for the trading card game and anime, all of which have spent decades as pop culture fixtures. A child will watch the show, which makes them want to buy cards (hopefully before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/van-gogh-museums-event-gets-gatecrashed-by-pokemon-tcg-scalpers-in-a-prime-example-of-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/">scalpers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> take that chance from them) or the newest game, or whichever order of operations you wish to apply. That kind of cultural cache can’t be engineered in the way corporations often want it to, and it further helps that Nintendo just has a game for any occasion to be released whenever it so chooses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers like Sony and Microsoft would very much like their games to become big transmedia enterprises, where games become movies that lead to more sales and further franchising. A lot of these would-be franchises are growing from double and triple-A games, the latter of which have become more costly to make. Movies are no stranger to high budgets, but games have started to really feel that strain, and not every one of them can get away with a remaster or PC port ahead of a silver screen adaptation. In other instances, a game project meant to build off an adaptation’s momentum may just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firesprite-s-twisted-metal-game-among-canceled-playstation-projects">get the ax</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for reasons out of its developer’s control. Abrupt studio closures or layoffs can be as game-changing as growing a game out into a multimedia juggernaut in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games and Hollywood have had a relationship for decades, but the new advent of adaptations is showing how one-sided this has become. The former has bent itself into a pretzel readying itself for adaptation, but that isn’t always going to work. Audiences for both have become adept at spotting when companies are steering media to a particular end goal, and will sometimes refuse to play along. Ensuring a healthy dynamic between the two mediums going forward will mean being less obvious in IP strategizing, as Nintendo has done. Having a direct hand in adaptations is important, but it's equally key to know when to ease off the throttle and let things play out organically.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team, and you can obtain a special card of the Bilbao star to add to your squad. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has been on top with regular releases of Flashback and End of an Era cards as part of the Ultimate TOTS celebrations. While few of the earlier releases have been expensive, the latest entrant is pretty cheap. This makes tonight’s SBC a perfect one for beginners to complete. </p> <h2 id="h-all-ea-fc-24-iker-muniain-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">All EA FC 24 Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Tonight’s challenge has only one task, but there are certain conditions which would have to be satisfied during squad submission. The solo squad means that you’ll need just eleven fodder items, which shouldn’t be a problem. </p>

Opting for the cheapest solutions will help you complete other SBCs like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-nacho-fernandez-flashback-sbc-solutions/">Nacho Flashback</a>. </p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Iker Muniain</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fabinho 84</li> <li>Gabriel Megalhaes 84</li> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Gregor Kobel 87</li> <li>Niklas Sule 84</li> <li>Ewa Pajor 87</li> <li>Thomas Muller 84</li> <li>Luka Modric 87</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> <li>Leroy Sane 84</li> <li>Emma Koivisto TOTW 87</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">After completing the SBC, you’ll unlock a 94-rated CAM item, which can also operate at LM and LW. In terms of value, the Muniain End of an Era challenge is worth it. The card has good in-game stats, and the ability to play in various positions. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="false">However, the new End of an Era card has 4* Skills and 4* Weak Foot, which can be problematic in the current meta of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-maintenance-when-will-the-servers-come-back/">EA FC 24</a></em>. As I said, tonight’s SBC is more suited for relative beginners who are still building their squads. </p>

Unlike previous promos in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-anthony-martial-flashback-sbc-solutions/"><em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team</a>, Path to Glory will be all about national team superstars. </p>

The new season of the hit anthology TTRPG show will begin airing on June 26th, 2024. With only a few weeks until viewers are invited into the adrenaline-fueled world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> we have a chance to learn more about the setting and who is playing in the dome.</p>

<p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> follows the story of "six down-on-their-luck strip-mall employees [who]&nbsp;are sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes." Once inside the action movie, it's up to these characters to find their way through the movie to ultimately escape and get home.</p>

<p>Check out the full trailer below:</p>


<p>The players on this season of Dimension 20 are listed below first by the name of their 'real world' character and then by the action star that they become once they're inside the VHS.</p>

<ul><li>Jacob Wysocki as Andy 'Dang' Litefoot /&nbsp;Greg Stocks</li>
	<li>Ify Nwadiwe as Wendell Morris / Vic Ethanol</li>
	<li>Ally Beardsley as Russell Feeld / Jennifer Drips</li>
	<li>Alex Song-Xia as Liv Skyler / Kingskin</li>
	<li>Isabella Roland as Paula Donvalson (neé Buocadifuoco) / Jack Manhattan</li>
	<li>Rekha Shankar as Usha Rao / G-13</li>
	<li>Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM</li>
</ul><p>The trailer begins with DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describing scenes from a movie where a motorcycle-riding action star is wielding a katana attached to a chain. After a VHS for the movie <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is placed before the players they're pulled into the action themselves. Throughout the trailer you can see Lee Mulligan's attire get more torn and dirtied as he morphs into a John Mcclane look-alike from <em>Die Hard</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is the craziest you've ever been at this table" Ally Beardsley to GM Brennan Lee Mulligan</p>

<p>In a montage of character introductions, we meet the different action archetypes; rugged fighters, femme fatales, '<em>Fast and Furious</em>' style speed demons, gentlemen spies, and more.</p>



<p><em>Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</em> will be a 10-episode season beginning to air on June 26th, 2024 on Dropout. At the moment the game system in use for Never Stop Blowing Up is not explicitly clear, we have reached out to Dropout for clarification.</p>

<p>This season is coming hot off the heels of Fantasy High: Junior Year.

            <p>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-officially-working-on-pc-game-support-for-the-ps-vr2-headset">was on the way</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certification-surfaces-marking-one-more-step-towards-official-support-in-2024">it looked to be fairly soon</a> - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...</p>

<p>On the good news side of things, the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will support SteamVR out of the box when it releases on August 7th, meaning you’ll be able to hook it up and play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">virtual reality games</a> on Steam - including Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>. To do that, you’ll just need to hook up the headset to your PC using the adapter and a DisplayPort 1.4 cable, then run both SteamVR and the new PlayStation VR2 app, which will let you tweak around with settings for things like play area.</p>
<p>That’s great news, especially as the VR2 is a very comfortable headset by all accounts and puts some lovely 120Hz 4K (2000x2040) OLED displays in front of your eyes across a 110-degree field of view.</p>
<p>What’s not so great is that many of the features that arguably make the VR2 a strong contender for one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-headset">best VR headsets</a> overall won’t be supported on PC, even when using the official adapter. Notably, those panels, crisp as they are, won’t support HDR on PC, and the VR2’s impressive eye-tracking won’t work either - though foveated rendering without using eye-tracking will still function. Headset feedback also won’t function, nor will the handheld controllers’ DualSense-based adaptive triggers or haptic feedback beyond simple rumble.</p>

<p>That leaves the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">list of working features</a> at the panels themselves, the headset’s see-through view - handy in case you’re about to bump into something - and the controllers’ finger-touch detection, along with 3D Audio in some games - albeit using SteamVR’s audio tech rather than the PS5-only Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p>
<p>If you’ve already got a VR2, being able to play VR games on PC without having to cough up for a whole new headset seems a no-brainer. If you’re weighing this up against other PC offerings such as the Meta Quest 3, though - which is already cheaper than the base VR2, and almost on par feature-wise due to these limitations - the combined cost of the VR2 itself the adapter certainly makes this a harder sell, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Still, the VR2 apparently hasn’t exactly set the world on fire since it came out a couple of years ago, so it might be you’re able to grab one for a steal and make the most of its nice hardware - even if some of its promising potential goes unrealised on PC.</p>

  <p id="V5Q0iB"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889773/dropout-anniversary-collegehumor-brennan-lee-mulligan-sam-reich">Dropout</a> released a first trailer for “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164051/best-new-tv-summer-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series">Never Stop Blowing Up</a>” on Wednesday, lifting the curtain on the next season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23883220/dimension-20-dropout-tv-show-anniversary-season-dnd"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>. </p>
<p id="rsqRoj">Hosted by founding game master Brennan Lee Mulligan in a series of increasingly incinerated outfits, “Never Stop Blowing Up” will follow six strip-mall employees played by Jacob Wysocki, Ify Nwadiwe, Ally Beardsley, Alex Song-Xia, Isabella Roland, and Rekha Shankar — but it sounds like they won’t be strip-mall losers for very long. </p>
<p id="vsh9bH">Our heroes find themselves “sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes - and must figure out how to navigate the movie to get home,” according to Dropout’s news release. </p>
<p id="O1aJFv">The trailer makes clear that those action heroes are drawn from a specific mold, echoing the likes of John McClane, Rambo, Dominic Toretto, and more. There also appears to be some kind of prop mechanic going on? With items like a dynamite bomb, a deck of cards, a bundle of “cocaine,” or a pack of cigarettes rotating around the table. </p>
<p id="Mqmv16">Fans will have to wait a few weeks to unravel those mysteries, however. “Never Stop Blowing Up” premieres on June 26 on Dropout TV, and run for 10 episodes. </p>

Included in these are several landscapes and landmarks giving fans a better understanding of the possible map layout for the game. One image appears to show Kyoto in the winter, while another looks to be Takeda Castle, located to the northwest of Kyoto. With these key landmarks, the rough size of the map falls in line with the previously discovered map layout from the ciphered numbers puzzle.

<p>While countless upcoming games have us in a perpetual state of excitement for this summer, few compare to the hype surrounding Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree. The first and only expansion for FromSoftware’s monolithic action game, thankfully, won’t require our entire SSD to play. Here’s the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree file size to help you prepare!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-shadow-of-the-erdtree-download">How Big is the Shadow of the Erdtree Download?</h2>



<p>To fully download and install Shadow of the Erdtree, you must have <strong>approximately 16GB of free space on an SSD</strong>. For comparison, Elden Ring requires 45GB for just the base game. In total, you’ll need ~61GB of free space for the main game and its DLC. </p>



<p>Overall, considering just how many hours you can squeeze out of the game, that’s seriously good value for the space requirements. We’re witnessing countless video games balloon in size, with Call of Duty and Destiny 2 proving to be the biggest offenders, requiring hundreds of GB of free space on your drive. It’s nice to have such a high-quality product that doesn’t eat space like candy.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-prepare-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree">How to Prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<ul>
<li>Take some time to track down key resources and materials, such as <strong>Smithing</strong> <strong>Stones</strong>, <strong>Bell Bearings</strong>, <strong>Grave Glovewort</strong>, and <strong>Ghost</strong> <strong>Glovewort</strong>. These upgrade materials allow you to improve your weapons and spirit ashes significantly before the difficulty spike in Shadow of the Erdtree.</li>



<li>You must <strong>defeat Mohg </strong>to access Shadow of the Erdtree. He’s weak to <strong>Bleed</strong>, <strong>Physical, </strong>and <strong>Poison Damage</strong>, so prioritize dishing those out during his boss fight to make quick work of the monstrosity.</li>



<li>While the DLC recommends you level to somewhere between <strong>100 and 150</strong>, if you can defeat Mohg at a lower level, then you should be okay to access the new zone. If you want to feel safe and endure less of a challenge overall, level to 150 beforehand.</li>
</ul>
