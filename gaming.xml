<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2088611c25fb5/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>The day is finally upon us! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> arrives on the Switch 2 (and Switch 1, have no fear) in just a few hours, with Team Cherry doing a global drop later on today.</p>
<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jinzmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>Valve has trademarked the term Steam Frame, lending fuel to rumors that the company is planning to release a console counterpart to its popular handheld Steam Deck. No matter what form the Steam Frame takes, it looks like Valve is planning to expand its gaming hardware offerings in the near future.</p><p>Valve filed two separate trademarks for the Steam Frame on September 2, as spotted by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n7ojk1/steam_frame_trademarked_by_valve_computer_hardware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user</a>, with each covering a different use.

The Steam Deck, for reference, was listed under "handheld computers" and "computer hardware," among other related categories.</p>

<p>While the trademark filing doesn't have enough information to confirm anything, the industry rumor mill suggests Valve is working on multiple hardware projects including a Steam console codenamed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fremont</a>, a new SteamVR headset codenamed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckard</a>, and new Steam controllers. The Valve Fremont <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently appeared</a> in a listing on benchmarking platform Geekbench, further fueling speculation around the project.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machines-first-impressions-the-specs-prices-/1100-6425734/" data-ref-id="1100-6425734">Steam Machine</a>, Valve's first foray into compact gaming hardware running the Linux-based SteamOS, was a flop, the company has had better luck with recent releases including the popular handheld Steam Deck. Many have speculated that Valve would return to console-like hardware for SteamOS after the Steam Deck's success, and recent news is making a console announcement look more likely.</p><p>As for what exactly the Steam Frame will be, the multiple trademarks suggest the branding could be intended to cover multiple upcoming hardware devices, as well as their related peripherals.</p>

                <p>Prior to this year, the release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 console was the subject of numerous rumors and speculative reports. The wait for fans officially ended in early June, but a new report states that Nintendo pushed back the Switch 2 launch multiple times despite the frustration of third-party companies.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the reason Nintendo didn't rush Switch 2 to the market is because its designers requested extended deadlines for the launch titles in order to "perfect" them. Nintendo prioritized that above all other concerns, including the third-party publishers and fans who clamored for the console for years.</p><p>Earlier this summer, a separate report noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-dev-kits-still-sound-somewhat-rare-even-2-months-after-launch-report/1100-6534247/" data-ref-id="1100-6534247">Switch 2 development kits are still rare among third-party</a> companies even months after launch. It's believed that issue may be the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/" data-ref-id="1100-6533186">why some Switch 2 third-party titles have yet to be officially announced</a>. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-developer-claims-that-sales-were-below-our-lowest-estimates/1100-6532572/" data-ref-id="1100-6532572">Switch 2 launch titles have also outsold the third-party games</a> for the console by a much higher ratio than expected.</p><p>Nintendo released a statement last month that said it regrets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-regrets-the-inconvenience-of-switch-2-selling-out-all-the-time/1100-6533634/" data-ref-id="1100-6533634">the inconvenience caused by Switch 2's scarcity</a>. The company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 sold over 6 million units</a> by the first week of August, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">has reportedly moved 2 million consoles</a> in North America alone.</p><p>For now, Switch 2 is the only major modern console that hasn't been hit by a price hike over tariffs. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">that may change in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo recently released an update for Switch Online, which among other little tweaks adds a nice, nostalgia infused Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app.</p>
<p>This Easter egg can be found by twiddling with the analogue stick while booting up the Game Boy Advance app. If you do this, you will be met with the classic GBA bootup sequence.</p>
<p>You can see how the Easter egg looks via the video I took this morning.</p> <div>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>



<h2 id="h-placement-matches-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Placement Matches Coming to Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big change. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>

            <p>Amazon has cast Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Turner, known to many as Game of Thrones' Sansa Stark, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">rumoured to be in talks to play Lara Croft in November last year</a>. She will follow in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander, who both previously portrayed the globetrotting archeologist in live-action Tomb Raider adaptations. </p>

<p>As previously reported, Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>
<p>"I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p><p>Turner added she was "thrilled beyond measure" to be playing Lara Croft. "She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many - and I am giving everything I've got," the actor said. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking."</p>
<p>Amazon has confirmed production on the series will officially begin next year, on 19th January. Joining Waller-Bridge and Turner on the series are Jonathan Van Tulleken as director and executive producer, as well as Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" - doesn't have a release date yet, but will air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-on-xbox-sells-a-lot-more-than-gears-of-war-reloaded-on-playstation.1288389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If there’s one thing Bethesda Game Studios does well, it’s the creation of a top-notch expansion. For the Fallout franchise, some sizeable expansions have dropped over the years that have left players impressed and hungry for more. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered some great additional content. In this list, we’re taking a look at the 10 best Fallout DLCs and ranking them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-fallout-dlc-ever">What’s The Best Fallout DLC Ever?</h2>



<p>Everyone has their idea of the perfect expansion. It’s a mostly subjective argument, but there are some universal truths. If you disagree with this list of the best Fallout DLCs ranked, then be sure to leave a comment and set us straight!</p>



<h3 id="h-best-nuka-world-fallout-4">Best: Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-World was a fantastic adventure from start to finish, taking players to a wide, open theme park that could be made operational. It was the perfect endgame DLC to an already impressive base game, and it served as a sublime send-off to the best-selling core Fallout game ever released. </p>

<p>Point Lookout was a creepy, backwoods expansion that forced players to contend with some of Fallout 3’s eeriest enemies. It was a darker, more foreboding expansion that took players out of the base game’s map and put them in the heart of a swamp bursting at the seams with danger.</p>

<h3 id="h-3-far-harbor-fallout-4">3. Far Harbor (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Behind Nuka-World, Far Harbor was a fantastic expansion for Fallout 4, and in many ways, it was similar to Point Lookout from Fallout 3. It introduced players to a brilliant map that was a wonder to explore, and the only thing holding this particular Fallout DLC back from the top spot is the series of annoying puzzles that must be solved as part of the expansion. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-pitt-fallout-3">4. The Pitt (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pitt was so good that Bethesda Game Studios decided to revisit it in Fallout 76 more than a decade later. It was one of the grittier Fallout expansions, landing players in the heart of Pittsburgh to go toe-to-toe against savage, mutated creatures that were once slaves, twisted up by their masters and the environment around them.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-lonesome-road-fallout-new-vegas">5. Lonesome Road (Fallout New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout: New Vegas had some fantastic expansions, but few are as memorable as Lonesome Road. It’s one of the best Fallout DLCs because of the writing behind it and the characters it introduces – namely, Ulysses. It expands beautifully on the protagonist’s backstory and gives players a great location to explore,but  it’s just a little light on content.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-broken-steel-fallout-3">6. Broken Steel (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Broken Steel was one of the best Fallout DLCs that was released to appease fans who wanted more of the base game. It boosted the game’s level cap, added a stack of new content, and introduced an extra act that saw players fight the Enclave directly alongside the Brotherhood of Steel – Liberty Prime included. It was a bit of an afterthought that Bethesda created to ‘give players a little more’, but it was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-automatron-fallout-4">7. Automatron (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Automatron was a short but sweet Fallout DLC that saw players pick up the ability to solve a mechanical mystery and create a robot companion that could be anything they so desired. It was the first outing for the expansion concept in Fallout 4, and while it didn’t add too much, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours’ worth of content.</p>



<h3>8. Vault-Tec Workshop (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Vault-Tec Workshop, players get access to their own customisable Vault. It’s a massive, underground cavern with untold potential to craft something truly unique, but that’s about all it is – a building expansion. There are a few experiments to carry out, in true Vault-Tec style, but ultimately, it’s an expansion that allows you to build a Vault, which is about it.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-honest-hearts-fallout-3">9. Honest Hearts (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Honest Hearts has been the subject of many memes over the years, most notably because of the character that’s introduced in it – The Burned Man, Joshua Graham. It’s a great narrative, but the expanded area that’s opened up for exploration isn’t all that memorable, and aside from the core story, there isn’t much to unravel.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-steel-reign-fallout-76">10. Steel Reign (Fallout 76)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Steel Reign was one of the more sizeable Fallout 76 expansions – more commonly known as ‘updates’ – that brought the Brotherhood of Steel back into play. It was a follow-on from Steel Dawn, which was released around a year prior, and it added plenty of story content for the player to enjoy – but since it dropped in 2021, Bethesda Game Studios hasn’t been back to revisit the Brotherhood storyline. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-like-hitman/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-007-first-light-like-hitman-io-interactive-development-explained.1288353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Is 007 First Light like Hitman from a gameplay standpoint? That’s a common question from anyone who hears IO Interactive is making the jump to James Bond.</p>



<p>Millions of people fell in love with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-75-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy</a> over the last decade. During that time, Agent 47 had an established formula that was consistently refined with interesting maps and engaging challenges.</p>



<p>James Bond has quite an interesting history when it comes to video games, but what can you expect in the newest game? Is 007 First Light like Hitman?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-gameplay-similar-to-hitman">Is 007 First Light Gameplay Similar to Hitman?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He may be another spy, but James Bond is not Agent 47. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>007 First Light can be compared to Hitman and shares some of its mechanics and stylings, but it’s not an exact copy and is its own game.</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the things that connect Hitman and First Light are the exploration aspects of the game. When things are calm, James Bond will survey his environment and look for ways to sneak around and enter restricted areas by causing distractions or using gadgets to disorient enemies. That is very similar to how Agent 47 operates in Hitman, so the blueprints align there, though we haven’t seen James try to steal someone’s outfit like 47 often does.</p>



<p>We would say where the two differ the most is in the combat. In Hitman, the focus was very much on remaining stealthy as long as possible. Agent 47 can fight his way out of a tricky situation, but those moments are rather limiting. Shooting in the Hitman games is rather stiff, and his melee is basic at best.</p>



<p><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">007 First Light</a> seems to have gotten a big facelift when it comes to combat. Bond can do more with the environment around him when fighting, like grab an enemy and throw them in a direction, or fight to take a weapon away from someone. We’ve also seen Bond control an airplane and make it rock sideways while in combat, so there could be bigger ways to give enemies a harder time taking you out.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-has-more-to-it-than-stealth-and-combat">007 First Light Has More to It Than Stealth and Combat</h2>



<p>For the Hitman games, stealth and combat are essentially the main things you have to look forward to. There is a story there, but to be honest, it’s nothing that special or interesting.</p>



<p>IO Interactive is putting in the work to make 007 First Light a more cinematic experience than Hitman. Consider the car driving sections that never appeared in Hitman, or just how much more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond is willing to talk</a> to get his way. We love Agent 47, but the point of his character is to be silent and stoic.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early look we’ve had at the game</a>, 007 First Light definitely appears to have some of the Hitman DNA in it, but we would say it’s been built on top of not necessarily making something completely new, but augmenting what came before so that James Bond can stand apart from Agent 47.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you love the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy? How are you feeling now that IO Interactive is focused on James Bond instead of Agent 47? Let us know in the comments or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

If you want to go the extra step, consider a very <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive collector’s edition</a>.</p>

The Switch 2 version will ship on a game-key card.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>This is an escape <a title="Genres > Action [3,007 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> that follows the rules of the popular Fuji TV show <em>Run for Money</em>, in which players become Runners and win prize money based on the time spent escaping the Hunters let loose in an enclosed area.</p><p>This game is the first in the series to include a “Hunter Mode” in which the player can aim to become the greatest Hunter. It also supports online play, so players can play against users across the country and compete in the online leaderboards.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Realistic Escape Action Just Like the TV Show</strong></p><p>The game flow is as follows: Runners get a head start to escape, and Hunters are released 30 seconds later. Runners accumulate prize money based on the amount of time they spend escaping, and can of course surrender at any point to keep the prize money accumulated thus far. If the Runners can avoid being captured by a Hunter within the 15-minute time limit, they have successfully escaped. But if a Runner is captured by a Hunter, it is “Game Over!” Can you escape the Hunters until the very end?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Become the Hunter in Hunter Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunter Mode,” which puts players in control of a Hunter, is included for the first time in the series. Players have always dreamed of becoming a Hunter and chasing down and capturing Runners, and now it is finally possible. Become a Hunter, capture Runners, and aim to be the greatest Hunter. Updated Hunters will also appear.</p><p><strong>A Series First: Hunters vs. Runners Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” in which players can choose to play as either a Hunter or Runner, is included for the first time in the series. In order to stop the rampaging Hunters, who have lost control of their power, the Runners must launch a counterattack against the Hunters using weapons obtained in missions. In “Online VS,” up to 12 users can play together (four Hunters, eight Runners). Who will come out on top between the Hyper Hunters Army and the Runners?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Online VS</strong></p><p>Includes an “Online VS” feature that allows up to 12 players to compete for the first time in the series. Users can compete online via quick and simple matchmaking, or play against friends. All five “Runners Mode” and “Hunters vs. Runners Mode” stages can be played online.</p><p><strong>Compete Against Players Across the Country in the Online Leaderboards</strong></p><p>In “Hunter Mode,” your ranking is determined by your score based on how fast you clear the stage. In “Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” your ranking is determined by the total prize money accumulated playing both offline and online.</p><p><strong>High-Variety Game-Original Stages</strong></p><p>The battle stages are all original! There are a total of five stages: “Wonderland,” “Diversity,” “Fantasy,” “The Airport,” and “The Pier.” The events that occur in each stage will trigger various missions, and by completing those missions, your escape may be made easier through things like the escape area expanding or obstructing the release of Hunters.</p><p><strong>Series Mainstays Return</strong></p><p>Popular elements from the series will of course return, including “GameShare” and “Local Communication Play” with up to four players, “Hard Mode” featuring “Hyper Hunters” with enhanced performance, and “Trophy” and “Hunter Figure” collecting.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/run-for-money-hunters-vs-runners-can-you-win-as-either-adds-switch-2-version-launches-december-4-in-japan]]></content:encoded>

<p>New features, but no game update</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' library has this week been expanded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> and the Japan-only release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>. Although the GBA title hasn't been made available locally, the app here has received an update, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Firstly, the official banner and icon for this app have been updated – swapping out the 'Switch Online' branding for 'Nintendo Classics'. Apart from this, there's <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-classics-switch-online-gba-app-adds-new-functionality/">reportedly been some added "functionality"</a> including button remapping options along with 1080p support in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>
<p>An easter egg has also been added to the start up screen. If you hold the left analogue stick when starting the app, the original GBA boot up screen will appear (<a href="https://www.vooks.net/game-boy-advance-boot-screen-easter-egg-add-to-switch-nintendo-classics-app/">here's a look via Vooks.net</a>).</p>
<p>Since the release of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has updated its other Switch Online retro apps with new features, improved filters and additional games. Nintendo highlighted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/icymi-nintendo-highlights-super-nes-nintendo-classics-features-update">updates to its SNES app</a> in a new video last week, including mouse support for multiple titles.</p>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.</p><ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing – spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Special Transmission Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="⚠『Yunyun Syndrome!?

<p>One issue was tied to the game's resolution not being properly optimised. Fortunately, it looks like SEGA has taken player feedback on board, with the company's official Japanese social media account revealing there'll be a patch to address this. Here's the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy Shinobi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this patch is on the way for the Switch version, so hopefully players won't have to wait much longer. Apart from the game's resolution, in our review build, we encountered some frame rate issues.</p>

Plus, there will be a new Companion, Sidekick, and more to enjoy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update also includes an "earnable avatar" Classic Rayman, a Murfy Companion (who will join you in battle and react to the events of the match), and a Forest Dragon Sidekick. There are also new themed emojis and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streameast, the world’s largest illegal sports streaming site, has pitched its final inning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6591670/2025/09/03/streameast-worlds-largest-illegal-sports-streaming-platform-shut-down-in-sting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Athletic</a>. This follows a year-long investigation on the part of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) – a coalition of companies and film studios that includes Amazon, Netflix, and Paramount – which culminated in a Sunday night raid that led to the arrest of two men in Egypt. I will miss the site terribly, despite obviously having never interacted with it in any meaningful way.</p><p>Streameast, says The Atlantic, averaged a whopping 136 million monthly visits. If you could think of a major sport, odds are you could find it while sailing the site’s largely reliable waters. Many, many other sports streaming sites exist, but Streameast was comparatively sturdy and unwavering. An anchor. Some prominent games industry figures – who also presumably did not use the site, or perhaps even know what it was – have called this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lxx6cqnwfk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their “9/11,”</a> given that NFL season is about to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in my other neck of the woods, the MMA world, which is a cesspit I obsessively follow in spite of myself because it’s a good way to turn my brain off while watching terrible men pound theirs into mush, fans are apoplectic.</p><p>“NOOOOOO,” reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ufc/comments/1n7gb7i/noooooo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current top thread on the UFC subreddit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Back when they'd play the Russian national anthem over [fighter] walkout songs, lol,” reminisced one commenter.</p><p>“I don't know why I loved those little touches so much,” replied another. “Made me feel like I was watching with a real fan.”</p><p>Commenters also poured one out for dudes who went on racist rants in Streameast chat boxes, of which there were a truly tremendous number.</p><p>Others on both the UFC subreddit and within various corners of the wider sporting web are fixated on The Principle Of The Thing: sports organizations have found more and more ways to nickel and dime fans, with the current subscription model potentially demanding hundreds or – if you’re a UFC fan, at least <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/breaking-news/article/ufc-agrees-to-groundbreaking-77-billion-deal-with-paramount-and-cbs-ditching-pay-per-view-model-123522139.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until next year</a> – thousands of dollars per year across multiple services. Sites like Streameast function as modern-day Robin Hoods, stealing from multibillion-dollar corporations to give a few hours of entertainment to the poor (and make money via ads, millions of dollars in Streameast’s case, which muddies the waters perhaps more than a little).</p><p>There’s just one problem with the way many publications are framing this story: Streameast does not appear to be entirely gone. The illicit sports kingpin has historically gotten around shutdowns via a series of different URLs, many of which continue to function as of this publishing. ACE told The Atlantic that these are merely “copycats,” but they seem to be closely tied to the mothership.</p><p>The sporting powers that be and various national governments might eventually find a way to whack-a-mole all of the URLs into oblivion, but even then, illicit streaming sites tend to operate like Hydras; when one head gets chopped off, another rises up to take its place. If this truly proves to be Streameast’s demise, it will likely still be a long time before [DOZENS OF NAMES REDACTED, BECAUSE HOW WOULD I EVEN KNOW THEM] meet similar ends.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime"><h3>I Unironically Like Netflix’s Live-Action Kakegurui TV Series</h3></a><p>Bet is a fun watch when you don’t have sweaty anime fans breathing down your neck

            <link>https://kotaku.com/leaked-fallout-merch-ai-art-target-hot-sauce-bethesda-2000622731</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-fallout-merch-appears-to-use-ai-generated-slop.1288230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, someone leaked what they claim to be new <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise that will reportedly soon be available on Target shelves around the United States. But fans think that at least one piece of leaked merch is using AI-generated imagery, aka slop.</p> <p>On September 2, a user on the <em>Fallout</em> subreddit posted a short video of them seemingly pulling out pieces of not-yet-announced <em>Fallout</em>-themed merchandise in a warehouse-like setting. The user claimed that the <em>Fallout</em> goodies would be sold at Target starting in November or December. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1n6x4fy/the_new_items_at_target/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">The original video has since been deleted</a>, possibly because the original poster was nervous about getting in trouble with Target. But <em>Kotaku</em> viewed the video before it was deleted, and the merch seemed real. And one item, <em>Fallout</em>-themed hot sauce, appears to be shipping to stores in a box that has AI-generated imagery on the back.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout/generative-ai-merch">As spotted by <em>PCGamesn</em>,</a> users in the comments below the leaked Target video began focusing on peculiarities in the hot sauce artwork. In the image, a couple is seen sitting at a table eating a Deathclaw’s hand. But the man can be seen using his knife and fork to cut up a napkin. The fork looks oddly shaped, too. Others pointed out that the Deathclaw hand seems to be floating oddly above the plate. The man’s right hand also seems off. All of this would lead one to believe this new <em>Fallout</em> merch is using AI-generated artwork.</p>

   <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Bethesda about the leaked art, but didn’t receive a response before publication. It should be noted that Bethesda likely contracted this artwork out via another company and didn’t create the image.</p> <p>The use of <a href="https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162">AI-generated slop</a> has become <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-xbox-ai-generated-1851128191">more and more prevalent in marketing and advertising</a> over the last two years as companies desperate to make the line go up cut corners to prove to investors they aren’t being left behind as AI-powered tech continues to grow. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-amazon-ai-art-bethesda-strike-release-date-1850772308">In fact, this isn’t even the first time an official <em>Fallout</em>-related artwork</a> has been scrutinized by fans for some strange, AI-like oddities. Will a man using a terrible fork to cut up a napkin stop collectors and fans from buying this piece of <em>Fallout</em> merch? Probably not, which is what companies are counting on.</p>

I look forward to it each year, as Hobonichi generates hype around the niche holiday by unveiling its new covers and books in the lead-up to its big release. Other planner brands start to announce their lineups around this time, too.

That includes stationary and planners—the Hobonichi launch for U.S. customers was obscured by the dark cloud of tariffs. Stationary, like other goods produced outside the U.S., are impacted by both Trump’s sweeping tariffs and the end of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519361/de-minimis-rule-tariffs-consumers-imports-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tax loophole that exempted packages $800 or less from import fees</a>. The official Hobonichi store ships its stationary goods directly from Japan to customers in the U.S.; it’s always been kind of expensive to do so, but this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/769427/trump-tariffs-online-shopping-shipping-suspended-de-minimis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the added fees tipped the scales for some people</a>—including me.</p><p>Created by Shigesato Itoi (who started the <em>Mother </em>series), Hobonichi planners are cult favorites among stationary enthusiasts; the bible-thin paper is perfect for fountain pens but keeps the robust planner fairly compact. There’s a lot of room for creativity, which is the planner’s biggest strength: People can tweak their setups to make the planner work for all sorts of scheduling and planning.</p><p>There are several different books and sizes to choose from, but each year, Hobonichi debuts a new set of accessories and covers to go alongside the planner. That’s where a lot of the excitement comes in—the covers are works of art on their own, and the limited edition nature of the release oozes FOMO. Hobonichi diehards, like me, line up in virtual queues every year for the chance to snag some prized cover that’ll perfect our planner setups for the following year. Planner season has its faults—that aforementioned FOMO leads to undeniable overconsumption of stationary goods that may even go unused—but it’s been, largely, a brief moment of joy where I can connect with fellow paper nerds to speak passionately about the superiority of Tomoe River paper, which Hobonichi uses.</p><p>I’ve ordered from Hobonichi for the past several years, but the last order I can find in my email is from 2021, where I ordered two Hobonichi planners (a Weeks planner to carry around with me, and an A6-sized book to keep at my desk) and a couple other accessories. The total was roughly $80, plus an additional $25 for shipping, which brought the total to $109. This year, I added a single A6-sized planner with an exceptionally cute Tamagotchi-themed cover to my cart. The planner, called a Techo, retails at Hobonichi for $54. The shipping—which includes “prepayment of duties and taxes”—added $44 to that total, plus an additional $8.10 for “duties and fees,” then the sales tax of $6.22, bringing the total price of a single planner to $112.32. I tried to see if things were any better with a smaller Weeks planner, which is $29 at the Hobonichi store. That brought my total to under $100, but the shipping was more than the cost of the planner itself. I just can’t justify it.</p><p>It’s hard to even tell if extra levies will be piled on when something gets into the U.S., too. The global nature of the stationary business, with products made in China, Japan, and assembled elsewhere, means that tariffs apply in complicated ways. Japan’s reciprocal tariff rate is 15%. China’s remains ever in flux, currently at 30%. There’s a lot going on.</p><p>The good news is that there are U.S. based retailers that are selling Hobonichi products. But because these retailers need to recoup the costs of the tariffs <em>they</em> spent to bring over the goods, the prices are indeed higher than at the Hobonichi store: The same Hobonichi that costs $54 at the official store <a href="https://lighthousepaper.com/products/hobonichi-techo-2026-original-book-cover-a6-tamagotchi-tamagotchi-techo-discovered-jan-mon-start?variant=50971041169540&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqOtPYP26HbBoe92lO_PKQTaA1Fz3gKwAWiExErBGK7ITJIETyeSfU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costs $77 elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Another side effect of the tariffs is that the removal of the de minimis exemption and additional tariffs means that importing goods is simply more complicated. There’s more paperwork and all packages have to clear customs, which is causing delays. At least two small businesses planning in-person Hobonichi events, <a href="https://www.thepapermouse.com/collections/hobonichi?srsltid=AfmBOoq2HusVo7nStMY7wyz2fCLO8tHoUbJW76KYjlKJGcLQFJRiqJxm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Paper Mouse in Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/blogs/news/hobonichi-pop-up-canceled?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoseka Stationary in New York</a>, had to cancel events when their Hobonichi shipments got caught up in customs.</p><p>I ultimately decided not to purchase a Hobonichi planner for 2026. Should that decision hold, it’ll be the first time in nearly five years that I don’t plan my days, weeks, and months in the planner system. I might change my mind if I can find a reasonable price. I’m holding out for an update on another planner system I like, Take A Note, to announce its 2026 planners—<a href="https://take-a-note.store/en-us/blogs/news/2026-take-a-note-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something scheduled for mid to late September</a>. (Take A Note ships from Taiwan, using Japanese paper, so I’m certain it’ll be impacted by tariffs, too.)&nbsp;</p><p>For now, I’m simply not buying stationary. The thing about this hobby is that there is so much to consume, so many different colorful and shiny things that always feel absolutely necessary; I’ve collected a lot of it. I’m using this tariff chaos to dig into my already too big supply and use up the stash. I’m plucking out stickers I forgot I had to slap into half-filled notebooks; re-wetting the dried up paints I left sitting too long in my closet; and inking up the pens I’ve once dubbed too nice to use. That’s the point of it all, no? The hobby inspires in me the desire to hoard, but I’d like to change that, so when I do, indeed, get my 2026 planner, I’ll appreciate it even more.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime"><h3>I Unironically Like Netflix’s Live-Action Kakegurui TV Series</h3></a><p>Bet is a fun watch when you don’t have sweaty anime fans breathing down your neck

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, there's already been a PlayStation State of Play for September 2025. It was entirely focused on one game, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">007 First Light,</a> and wasn't exactly what we had in mind when rumors of a September State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">cropped up just weeks ago</a>. However, a new report, this time from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/">Insider-Gaming</a>, claims that there is still another presentation coming later this month that might even feature Marvel's Wolverine from Insomniac. </p>



<p>The long and short of the report is that sources Insider-Gaming spoke to claim that there's another event coming before the month is over, and that will "<em>almost certainly</em>" feature Marvel's Wolverine, which we've not seen hair-nor-adamantium-claw of since its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/">reveal and announcement in 2021</a>.</p>



<p>There's been plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/">leaked information</a> following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/">ransomware attack</a> that Insomniac suffered in 2023, but that information becoming public could have been the key reason for Insomniac changing its plans, so it's good to remember that nothing we saw from those leaks was set in stone.</p>



<p>And while there have been previous claims that Marvel's Wolverine would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker/">shown in the near future</a>, which proved to be wrong, it's worth considering that beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-already-gone-gold/">Ghost of Yotei</a> this October, we don't have a strong picture of what PlayStation Studios has coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>That's not to say that PlayStation and Insomniac have been sitting on Marvel's Wolverine for so long that it'll be ready to go before 2025 is over, just that it wouldn't be crazy to consider that Insomniac is probably getting close to finishing it, now that we're at least four years into the game's development.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is just a rumor, so take it with an appropriate amount of salt. Hopefully, though, for Insomniac fans who would love to see the studio take on other comic book characters that don't swing from webs, we are only weeks away from hearing more about Marvel's tragic self-healing, adamantium-filled Canadian.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light has been revealed after a long bout of speculation and fan casting.</p>



<p>With IO Interactive taking over and making a story for a James Bond just getting started in the spy business, many have been wondering who would be taking on the role with this young Bond, with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date now set</a>.</p>



<p>Not only have we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten a good look at gameplay</a>, but the voice behind the spy himself has been announced. Here is who the voice actor is for James Bond in 007 First Light.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-james-bond-in-007-first-light">Who Voices James Bond in 007 First Light?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy has a very different license to kill. Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light is Patrick Gibson.</strong></p>



<p>He is a 30-year-old Irish actor who was born in London. While not the most recognizable name you will hear, Gibson is probably best known for playing a younger Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin, which is a prequel series. Having him as a just-starting-out James Bond kind of fits in perfectly.</p>



<p>For more background on Patrick Gibson, you can check out his <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2617600/?ref_=mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDb</a> page to see if there are any other shows or movies you can recognize him in, but we are unaware of the other projects he’s been in. With all of that being said, 007 First Light is the first video game acting role that Gibson has had. </p>



<p>So far, his voice acting seems to be done pretty well, and we think he sounds like he fits the part perfectly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-s-james-bond-canon">Is 007 First Light’s James Bond Canon?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the James Bond in 007 First Light is not canon to the overall James Bond story.</strong></p>



<p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/007-first-light-isnt-canon-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Radio Times</a>, Jonathan Lacaille, the franchise director at IO Interactive, said that while a lot of what is included in the game, including the scar on James’ cheek, is from the novels, the things that happen here are not connected to what is currently in production with Amazon MGM, instead, it will “live alongside” those movies.</p>



<p>While Patrick Gibson’s James Bond isn’t considered canon, it’s still a really big name for him to be attached to. When you think of 007, you are usually linking some very big-time Hollywood actors to the role. Gibson can now say he stands alongside names like Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, and Sean Connery, while delivering a very unique take on the character we have not seen before.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Patrick Gibson is a good choice to portray a younger James Bond? Is 007 First Light doing enough to stand out in your mind as a must-play game? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>After being announced six years ago, multiple delays, and years of anticipation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-and-time/1100-6534447/" data-ref-id="1100-6534447">releasing on September 4</a>. Now, on Silksong eve, a resurfaced Reddit thread about the original Hollow Knight is a great reminder of just how far the franchise and developer Team Cherry have come in the past decade.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3tj0p4/comment/cx6lr3t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a>, posted by Reddit user crazy_loop 10 years ago, includes a trailer for the original Hollow Knight prior to its release in 2017 and features a heartfelt message.</p><p dir="ltr">"Last year my best friend quit his full-time job to chase his dream and make a fully fledged video game," the post reads. "Today he just released a trailer and it looks beyond amazing."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2025, a new trailer for Hollow Knight: Silksong would have set the internet ablaze, but back in 2015, the response was more muted, to say the least. Many players seemed indifferent.</p><p dir="ltr">The most upvoted response to the post stated that the game is probably "a fine game, but the market is currently saturated with side-scrolling platformers so I feel his game may not do as good as he hopes." Another user said the game looked fun, but they "hate to be raining on a parade" and continued that Hollow Knight looked to lack the "innovation and individuality of something like Limbo." They continued: "probably not going to be huge." Yet another said the game looked "cliche."</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a decade makes. There were definitely people in the Reddit thread who disagreed that the market was "saturated" with similar games and recognized that Hollow Knight could be something special. Some even expressed interest in buying it based on the trailer. Overall, however, the general consensus seemed to be that Hollow Knight looked fine, but might have a hard time finding an audience. Some said it might get a decent sales boost from appearing on Reddit's front page.</p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Hollow Knight has sold more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">15 million copies</a>, is breaking its all-time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">concurrent player peak on Steam</a>, and its sequel is such a big deal that numerous other games have announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delays in order to avoid Silksong's release</a>. Not bad for the sequel to a small indie game that, judging from this Reddit thread, many expected to just be another drop in the metroidvania bucket.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Hollow Knight's huge success and wild anticipation from fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Hollow Knight: Silksong will only cost $20</a>, $5 more than the original.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Season four of Marvel Rivals is officially known as The Heart of the Dragon, and it's introducing one character fans of the (super) hero shooter have been hoping for: Daredevil. In the cinematic reveal trailer, he faces off against Angela, the long lost sister of Thor and the other character joining the roster. You can check it out for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer shows the two characters seemingly acting as representatives of Heaven and Hell. This is a particularly interesting take on Daredevil, as his stories, especially in the recent live-action series, traditionally focus on street-level crime with minimal super powers. In this trailer, he also seems to unleash energized punches and a powerful devil form. It's hard to tell what his canonical abilities are, versus what are stylized visuals for the animation, but Marvel Rivals sometimes provides original takes on characters and their origin stories, so it could go either way.</p><p>"The Timestream Entanglement has drawn the Seven Capitals together, forming the Heart of Heaven. After Knull’s fall, Hela is imprisoned in the An'Hay-Zhidi, where Dizang—Devil of the Eighth City—dares her to atone for her sins," the video description reads. "But Angela will not forgive her betrayal. She arrives in the Heart of Heaven demanding Hela be handed over, yet its guardian refuses to surrender someone under his protection. Justice will be served and a debt will be paid."</p><p>In a following, more detailed video, the developers at Netease confirm that Angela would be a vanguard, using her ichor to form weapons and a shield. She'll also get a team-up with Thor, who will be able to throw a thunder spear which he can jump to, dealing damage upon landing. Other team ups are adjusting as well: Magik and Black Panther are losing theirs, but Magik is getting a tether ability as a part of the team up between Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange, while Black Panther is joining the team up between Namor and Hulk.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Season four will also bring other, more minor new features. A new arcade hub will hold new and returning modes like big brain blast, clone rumble, conquest, conquest (annihilation), and doom match, along with free fight, which removes limits on duplicate heroes. You'll also be able to mark your preferred heroes into a favorites tab, other players can see custom ultimate effects, and, hilariously, they're adding a slow walk setting to the PC version of the game because they "heard how much you like slow walking for superhero aura farming."</p><p>Lastly, they announced that rank placement matches are coming to the game eventually, but won't be ready in time for season four. Players have expressed frustration that each season resets them so far down the competitive ladder that it's frustrating to have to fight through lower ranks with less skilled players to get back to their standard challenge, and placement matches are a possible solution to that.</p><p>Angela and the rest of Marvel Rivals season four come to the game for free a week from Friday, on September 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/03/marvel-rivals-season-four-adds-daredevil-and-angela-to-the-roster-launches-next-week]]></content:encoded>
