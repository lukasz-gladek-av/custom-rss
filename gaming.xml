            <p>Three Fields Entertainment, developers of Burnout with sky roads racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckreation">Wreckreation</a>, have announced that their entire team have been put on notice of redundancy. According to the announcement from CEO and former Criterion studio director Fiona Sperry, this comes as Three Fields find themselves without backing from Wreckreation publishers THQNordic, having "had to self-fund most of this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful," Sperry wrote in a message shared via the game's Twitter account.</p>
<p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us," she continued. "What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today."</p>
<p>Said video, which you can watch via the tweet above, shows off a number of feature additions which I'll be keen to give a go if they do make it into Wreckreation. One's an "accident black spots" mode mirroring classic Burnout's brilliant crash mode, in which you're given a junction and tasked with causing as costly a pileup as possible. There's also a "tightrope mode" all about driving along very narrow airborne obstacle courses, the ability to add buildings to the map while in the game's live mix building mode, and a bunch of construction vehicles and trucks you can drive around.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy.</p><p>Since the launch of *Wreckreation*, our small… <a href="https://t.co/4lq7irQrNF">pic.twitter.com/4lq7irQrNF</a></p></div>— Wreckreation Game (@ArcadeDriving) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeDriving/status/1996584475682115871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Of all those, the crash mode's something I could genuinely see giving Wreckreation some bounce-back potential, assuming the likes of BeamNG.Drive haven't filled that void in many players' minds. The ability to essentially build your own towns could also go a long way to helping put a plaster on one of the game's biggest problems - its boringly barren worldspace outside of player-built sky spaghetti.</p>
<p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry wrote. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team." As of writing, Three Fields still plan to deliver an update adding crossplay to Wreckreation before Christmas.</p>
<p>All the news we report about game developers losing their jobs or being at risk of that sees us send our best to the folks affected, but I'm particularly sad to see Three Fields in this tough situation. That's largely because I really enjoyed the work Sperry, Alex Ward and co did on Burnout and Need For Speed while at Criterion, with both those series either dormant or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">currently on hold</a>.</p>
<p>Both Wreckreation and 2019's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dangerous-driving">Dangerous Driving</a> had a chance to be Three Fields' big 'Burnout's back, baby' moments, conclusively proving to the suits at EA that locking the series in the attic of dormant entities was a hugely short-sighted move. Neither quite managed to stick the landing, though. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckreation-melds-burnouts-anarchy-with-gta-onlines-airborne-marble-runs-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-polish">my hours playing both</a>, I've never felt like that faliure was down to them being cynical nostalgia-fests, attempts to cash in on the anarchic old arcade racers myself and others fell in love with. Instead, and perhaps this is because I've gone in each time hoping I'll be blown away, the two games felt like the vision was solid, but the small studio just hadn't been able to nail the nuances of execution.</p><p>They weren't a million miles off reigniting the magic of classic Burnout, with EA and Criterion's substantial resources behind it. They're still yet to get there, though. Here's hoping that another publisher who're willing to back Three Fields swoop in and as always, solidarity to the studio's staff as they face an uncertain future.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today. The Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 game was already getting dinged in some people’s minds over a trailer that showcased overly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368"><span>chatty companion characters</span></a><span>. Now we’ve moved on from side-eyeing MCU-era cringe to debates about whether or not the game even looks good. A lot of folks are throwing tomatoes at the supposedly lifeless open-world segments on social media, but people who are actually playing </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>tell a different story.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, some </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>screenshots are pretty rough. The game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-amiibo-samus-music-motorcycle-functionality-2000650508"><span>desert sections</span></a><span> can look pretty bland in still shots, and without any real dynamic weather effects or notable architecture and landmarks, they look like something out of a game from almost 20 years ago. The comparisons to older games that it resembles, or even older games that are doing a lot more with their environments, are not flattering.</span></p>

There are plenty of ugly areas in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, but there are also ones that look pretty lovely. </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, though? That shit looks like an ugly GameCube game that was still in early development, no matter where you are. So when another big Nintendo game seems to be following the same open-world style at the expense of detailed environments, it’s understandable why some folks would be worried.</span></p>

 <p><span>In general, </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has some notable graphic disparities depending on the environment you’re in. Folks have been noting this before the game was even out by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1nf7yrd/i_cant_wrap_my_head_around_how_theres_such_a_big/"><span>comparing shots from the same trailer</span></a><span>, in which the game oscillated between looking pretty alright to looking like the shots people are complaining about.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, some of this feels like knee-jerk reactions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>’s series-low reviews. The game is sitting at </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/"><span>a respectable 81 on review aggregate site Metacritic</span></a><span>, but that is a bit of a drop compared to the 90+ scores of the first three games. I saw folks on a ResetEra forum saying this was “an absolute failure” or a “fucking disaster” for the historically beloved series, so some of this drive-by hate feels a bit reactionary to a game some people have already decided is a flop.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But what are people who have actually played the game saying? I was surprised to see some folks on my feed also call it one of the best-looking games Nintendo had brought to its handheld console. However, most of the praise points specifically to the smaller-scale dungeon areas, rather than the open-world ones, even comparing its mood and visual identity to the </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>games, which makes sense considering staff who used to work on the series at 343 Industries have </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1996542214466687263"><span>moved over to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>developer Retro</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retro’s art design still rocks! Metroid Prime 4 is a visual stunner — and no framerate drops in sight.

What Nintendo has done here is a model that the rest of the industry needs to take note of. Great art and music should take priority over unnecessarily taxing graphical ‘innovations.’”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Within each dungeon-like area to explore, Metroid Prime 4 shines, mixing tactile FPS exploration with gorgeous visuals and impeccable atmosphere,” Oscar Taylor-Kent said in the </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span> review.</span></p> <p><span>Now that players have </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span> in their hands, some are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pdrahj/stunned_how_good_prime_4_looks_within_first_hour/"><span>praising the visuals</span></a><span>, especially in those smaller, more focused spaces.</span></p> <p><span>“Retro is a master of using mostly baked plus some tasteful dynamic lighting to achieve great visuals,” Reddit user threeinacorner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“You really need to see it on a highly capable OLED TV with really good HDR.

<p>Total War: Medieval 3 has been confirmed by the developers through a new announcement; the title is currently in its early pre-production stage. </p>



<p>The last instalment of Total War: Medieval was launched back in 2006, and the players have been aching for a new iteration of the series. Fortunately for them, Medieval 3 has been announced, and the developers have shared a wealth of details about the project through a new blog post and trailer. </p>







<h2 id="h-total-war-medieval-3-will-be-the-ultimate-what-if-game">Total War: Medieval 3 Will Be the Ultimate “What If” Game</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> featured Total War: Medieval 3’s game director, Pawel Wojs, providing players with all the details about the upcoming title. Wojs has worked on the previous instalment for almost 20 years and is now going to lead the latest project. The developer’s vision is to make Medieval 3 “the Total War sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history.” Interested readers can learn more about their <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vision</a> here.</p>

<p>The developers plan to achieve this by immersing players in historical accuracy and having the world respond “in ways that feel genuinely plausible.” The game is currently in early pre-production, with release years away, and they are just past the opening stages. The developers also have Warxore now, which is the next evolution of their game engine, which provides them “a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks – all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.”</p>

<figcaption>Combat is fast-paced, and you'll often face off against multiple foes at the same time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Fly Like a Blood Eagle</h2><p>One of the major selling points of <em>Cloudheim</em> is its fast-paced, high-flying combat. You begin the game with a triple jump by default; that alone should give you an idea of the tone being set here.</p><p>Combat mainly involves fighting a dozen small enemies and a couple of larger (usually armored) enemies and scoring dozens or hundreds of hits in a single battle. You have a few abilities that you can use situationally, and damage can be avoided by dodging on the ground or in the air.</p><p>That's not to say that you can bounce around the battlefield forever. Every ability — including your dodge — has a certain number of charges. Use up those charges, and casting that ability again will cause "mana burn" to build up.</p><p>If you fill up the mana burn meter, you both slow down and lose the ability to cast any of your abilities. In principle, the idea is to use combos and abilities carefully to take down enemies without building up too much mana burn.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current state of combat feels a little bland. I successfully button-mashed my way through 50 or so hours of gameplay with few problems; as long as I dodged the more serious enemy attacks, I was fine. Another layer of complexity is needed here for the combat system to truly feel engaging.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Restoring After Ragnarok</h2><p>Exploring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-map-guide-treasure-chest-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c2bed03-8d60-44b9-824d-17c8852eb58e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the world</a> and its dungeons (along with the quests you encounter along the way) is the meat of <em>Cloudheim's</em> gameplay, but it's not the only part — there is also an element of base building, town management, and shop management.</p><p>Your main base of operations is a flying turtle called Odin's Shell. The back of this turtle serves as a safe haven where you can build crafting devices, specialized structures, and decorations.</p><blockquote><p>The shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p></blockquote><p>You're not alone on this island, either. Adorable little creatures called "Blins" inhabit this place with you, and they can be assigned to certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-building-guide-how-to-get-blins" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de5d4611-4621-4a93-b9c8-33c18678a2e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> to work for you. You could, for example, assign a Blin to a prospecting site. When you next return to Odin's Shell, you'll find that it is filled with crafting materials for you to mine.</p><p>Perhaps the strangest inclusion of all is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-shop-guide-how-to-sell-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="314316d3-dc01-4826-a864-237ed4ac24e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shop</a>. Though it only occupies a small part of the game's description, the shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p><p>Alternating between exploring the world, advancing quests, and selling items in your shop forms the core gameplay loop of <em>Cloudheim</em>. It can be fairly engaging and entertaining (combat shallowness aside) — at least when it comes to the systems that are actually implemented.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Missing Mechanics</h2><p>A casual scroll through the building options or the in-game archive makes it seem like <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot to offer. My actual experience with the pre-launch version of the game, however, painted a somewhat different picture.</p><p>Important systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-forge-guide-purify-and-smelt-ore" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496c455c-6646-4c23-ac60-1f9c6601e4e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">smelting and forging weapons</a> are implemented, and they work well enough. In the early game, it doesn't really feel like anything is missing. This changes as you advance deeper into the game and the building system.</p><p>Take Alchemy, for example. You can find and grow plants that can then be converted into potions. However, the potions you get are entirely random, and they have no gameplay effect whatsoever; currently, potions are only used as stock for the shop.</p><p>This also applies to cooking. Menus allude to cooked food, and you can find bits of food (such as cheese wheels) as random loot, but you can't actually do anything with food other than sell it.</p><p>The lack of practical cooking and alchemy applications also renders the fishing system somewhat useless. I'm sure the alchemy, cooking, and fishing systems will get fleshed out some more in future updates. For now, there isn't much there.</p><p>I also encountered one major chunk of missing content at the end of the second island. Although the map implies that you can visit four major regions, the final dungeon at the end of the second island simply doesn't open. Progression tends to drag toward this point, making it much more difficult to move on to the third and fourth islands.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Cloudheim</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Like many games of this style, <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot of potential. The first island of content is solid, and the second island has a good chunk of content on it. You can probably expect a solid 20 or so hours of gameplay from what's there.</p><p>That said, there are still plenty of rough edges that need to be ironed out. If you're fine with trying a game that is very Early Access in a lot of ways right now, you should consider checking out <em>Cloudheim</em> and enjoying a somewhat different take on the whole Viking thing.</p><hr><p><em>Cloudheim</em> was previewed over approximately 50 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070270/Cloudheim/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.

<p>As one who thoroughly enjoys cozy games with robust building components in their gameplay, one was pleasantly surprised by how much content players will have access to in helping them create some gorgeously designed spaces. Whether it's a warm and cozy retreat perfect for finishing that novel along the snow-capped mountains, a mostly soundproof home to record that next radio smash hit, or a beach house to welcome family and friends for the holidays, there's plenty of design and decorating elements for players to explore and have fun with.</p><p>Sure, not everything featured in <em>Log Away</em> is perfect, and there are a few missed windows of opportunity that could've been capitalized on, aside from some technical issues experienced; this indie cozy sandbox‑building game makes for the ideal game to escape the toils and troubles of the world. And to celebrate the game's release, players can adorn their home in time for Christmas with themed seasonal items as part of a free DLC available until December 11th, 2025.</p><h2>Synergized Hearts And Spaces</h2><p>Jumping into <em>Log Away</em> comes with some hand-holding before players can truly let their creativity run freely, as a tutorial will guide players in learning gameplay and control basics. Additionally, they'll have access to plenty of building and decorating components and items to lay the foundations of the dream vacation home, from minimalist, rustic pieces to modern chic and beach-themed items, and, of course, seasonal Christmas items available through the themed DLC.</p><p>While the primary goal is to design and build their home away from home, they also have a Coziness System, which is fronted by the Cozy Heart. This unique mechanic, akin to a "thermometer" is an in-game meter that gradually gets filled up based on how cozy your living spaces are, or as the developer states, "a reflection of coziness" and this can be achieved by the number of items placed on the plot, where they're placed and more importantly, if these placed items match similar items to develop a synergy (think a table and chairs).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Carefully place similar furnishing and decor items together in a space to gain synergy and increase the home's coziness. (Picture: The-Mark Entertainment / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One will admit they didn't pay much attention to these synergies at first, as they were stumped when they realized the Cozy Heart meter wasn't gradually building up as one wanted; it was after rereading the tutorial that one realized that placing similar items together increased one's coziness meter. Additionally, it could be said that items from the same destination, pick, or interest may help increase a home's coziness; however, this was challenging to track and confirm.</p><p>Regardless, by default, we were placing similar objects together, for example: items attributed to the Writing interest or from a seaside/beach landscape can help increase the coziness if placed together in the same area. This may help and guide players into designing and decorating their indoor and outdoor spaces more thematically, and once maxxed out, they'll earn mementos called Keepsakes, each of which has an associated backstory and memory, and can be placed within their spaces to showcase them proudly.</p><p>These Keepsakes are specific to the interests players selected for their retreat, as there are 24 Keepsakes per interest to discover and obtain, but they cannot be acquired in a single retreat, so multiple retreat builds are likely needed for all Keepsakes to be unlocked. Nevertheless, players will be able to enjoy what Log Away has to offer without time constraints or pressure from them, and instead can be best enjoyed in their own time.</p><figure role="group">

The game also features soundtracks to serve as the main playlist while building their homes, as players can change up the soundtrack, but also toggle day and night time, and seasons to find the perfect weather conditions to warm up to in their beautifully decorated homes.</p><h2>Not Quite A Warm Welcome</h2><p>As mentioned before, not everything included or offered in <em>Log Away</em> is picture-perfect, and we had our fair share of issues we've encountered during the review process. Gameplay-wise, the biggest gripe during the review process is the lack of real estate when building our holiday cabin, as players will only have a 7x7 plot to work with.</p><p>As someone who's spent hours in <em>Tiny Glade</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/palia-starter-guide" rel="nofollow"><em>Palia</em></a>, both games which provide massive plot for players to build and decorate their homes, this small-sized plot is quite restrictive and at times, quite challenging to work with, especially towards maxxing out the Cozy Heart meter. Switching gears to game optimization and performance, when loading a saved game file or starting a new retreat, the graphics appeared distorted or grainy/grain-like, which, coupled with slow loading times, was a slight annoyance to be confronted with.</p><p>While the game controls are simple and easy to understand, toggling between building, furnishing, and decorating (or BFD stamps) can be clunky at times; the camera movement is what quickly became a slight nuisance. Whether it was to zoom in to place an object carefully or remove flowers or pathing, or zoom out to get the full view of our progress on the project, the camera movement and speed are extremely clunky and laggy, which makes using Photo Mode quite frustrating.</p><h2><em>Log Away</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p><em>Log Away</em> provided the ideal form of escapism, transporting players to tranquil destinations where they could build and decorate their dream vacation home. With plenty of building tools, furnishings, and decor items available for players to access on top of the thematical items and the Christmas DLC, players will be well occupied in designing, building, and decorating their spaces.</p><p>The game's coziness system is at the very heart of creating the ideal ambiance for their perfect getaway home by maximizing what space they have with the pieces they've selected to increase the coziness and, by doing so, unlocking Keepsakes. However, there are a few issues with optimization and performance due to buggy camera movement that hampered our experience in building, furnishing, or decorating mode.</p><p>This can also be transferred onto the Photo Mode, which made taking snaps of our completed projects or projects in progress a challenging process, as zooming and panning over the property gets laggy. Alongside these issues, the decision to lock players to a 7x7 building space on a massive plot is an interesting choice, as one hopes the plot size increases to give us more room to create more beautiful spaces and unlock more treasured memories to own as Keepsakes.</p><p>After all, we'll still be here for the cozy vibes and the profound memories from those treasured Keepsakes.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Log Away&nbsp;</strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass has gone through some turbulent times of late, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">sheen completely coming off the subscription service</a> as it made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">its cheaper tiers much less worthwhile</a>, followed by a series of price increases building to October’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">sudden 50 percent hike</a>. $30 a month is a heck of an investment, given that in 2023 it cost half of that, so if you’re paying, you’ll want to get the best out of it. And with over 400 games currently included, finding the stuff worth playing gets harder and harder. So to make life easier, we’ve gone through the jumbled pile and picked out the 10 best RPGs to play.</p> <p>There are, by Microsoft’s count, 307 games on Xbox Game Pass that it considers to be RPGs. But given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genre titles mean close to nothing now</a>, and all genres are merging together, a fair number of them are stretches. For instance, this list isn’t going to include any&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, no matter how many RPG elements the series has begun to include over the years. They can have their day in a Best Action Games list and be happy about it.</p>

 <p>Anyway, here are 10 of the best RPGs to install on your Xbox if you’re subscribed to Game Pass, with a good mix of the blatantly obvious and the somewhat more obscure.</p> <hr> <h2>Avowed</h2>  <p>I said it’d include the obvious, but it’d be criminal not to recommend one of the best new RPGs in&nbsp;<em>years</em>. Obsidian’s first/third-person free-roaming take on its glorious&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series proved to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">an absolutely cracking success</a>. It’s real-time magic-n-swords combat works brilliantly, in a world that’s as rich and detailed and packed with character as either of the previous, more traditional <em>Pillars</em> games. Plus, it offers so many extraordinary choices that you can play it all over again as soon as you’re done.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Dragon Age: Origins</h2>  <p>If you prefer, you can assume this entry to be for any of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games, given EA has all four of them included on Game Pass, including last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. But the first one, <em>Origins</em>, will always be the best. It was the result of ten years of work, with an obvious depth of lore and history showing the results of such an extraordinary investment of time. It also plays out with a combination of real-time and pauseable combat, allowing you to approach it new-school or old. It is one of the most wonderful RPG stories ever told.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Fallout: New Vegas (PC Only)</h2>  <p>Yes, you can play the more recently revamped&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> on Game Pass too, but if I’m picking just one of the series’ first-person era, it has to be Obsidian’s <em>New Vegas</em>. It’s scientifically proven to be the best of the lot, and it remains a gruesome tragedy that it’s not received a modern glow-up. But what better time to play this incredibly deep, post-apocalyptic RPG than in the weeks before Amazon Prime’s stunning&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> TV series reaches Vegas in its second season?</p>

 <hr> <h2>Moonlighter</h2>  <p>At a time when so many would-be RPGs have split off into the realm of the roguelite,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em> straddles the two fields like a mighty but modest titan. This adorably splendid game combines running a local store with the need to go off on deathly adventures to find loot to sell in said store. The result is a gorgeous mix of action-RPG and shop-running, town-building loveliness. There’s a sequel in early access on Game Pass too.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>  <p>One of 2025’s breakout hits, not least thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-xbox-goty-2000650073">to its inclusion on Game Pass</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has made turn-based RPG combat sexy again. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">definitely-not-an-indie game</a> from French developers Sandfall Interactive has a story that twists and turns as its chapters progress, a uniquely interesting defense system, and a voice cast to die for.</p>

 <hr>   <p>There’s no escaping it. It might be 14 years old (although this Special Edition is a mere nine), but <em>Skyrim</em> is still one of the best RPGs ever made. Bethesda’s colossal open-world RPG (long before everyone else was doing that) is still one of the most splendid ways to wile away a spare couple of months. Grab a horse, climb a mountain, find a mysterious cave, turn into a vampire, join a cult, and begin a life of crime, all before lunch.</p> <hr> <h2>Arx Fatalis (PC only)</h2>  <p>I’ve tried to stick to RPG games that can be played on both Xbox consoles and PC, but I can’t leave&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> off the list. This is from Arkane, the creators of <em>Dishonored</em> and&nbsp;<em>Prey</em>, and it’s every bit as much a demonstration of that (monstrously closed) studio’s talent. Originally released in 2002, despite being great, this was a first-person RPG that your dad loved but was a commercial flop. Thanks to the same hateful deal that killed Arkane, the game is now in Microsoft/Bethesda’s library and on Game Pass.</p> <hr> <h2>Citizen Sleeper 2</h2>  <p>Both&nbsp;<em>Citizen Sleeper</em> and its sequel are on Xbox Game Pass, so you can start at the beginning of these dark, cyber-noir RPG adventures if you so choose. The original game takes place around a single planet, the second an entire solar system, where the roll of the dice decides so much of the fate from which you’re endlessly trying to escape. They’re <a href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947">fantastic games</a>, unlike anything else out there, with stunning writing and the sensibilities of the best of tabletop gaming.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Diablo IV</h2>  <p>As much as I may have moaned about genre blurring at the start, there’s no question that action-RPGs are RPGs. For a while, the genre was so specifically dominated by <em>Diablo</em> that it was known as “Diablo-likes,” and it remains the case that Blizzard’s creations rule the roost. Yes, there are those who play these games for their endgame loops and grinds, but don’t let that put you off: clicking your way through the story and combat of the core game is a rewarding experience in its own right.</p> <hr> <h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>  <p>Has there been a more consistently great trilogy of RPG games than&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>? Well, have it out in the comments. But in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Legendary Edition</em> is all three of the&nbsp;<em>good</em> games in the series, remastered in 4K, and with all 40 pieces of DLC. It’s a glorious story, and while many were unsatisfied with the (excellent—fight me) ending, the space adventure trilogy remains one of video gaming’s all-time highlights.</p> <hr> <p>Your favorite Game Pass RPG isn’t here? That’s because we found out you like it so much and deliberately left it off the list to make you mad. So get revenge by explaining what you’d have included instead of&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Dumps This Mini PC at Its Cheapest Price Ever, a 4.5-Star Windows Backup Even if You Own a Mac Mini]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-this-mini-pc-at-its-cheapest-price-ever-a-4-5-star-windows-backup-even-if-you-own-a-mac-mini-2000650495</link>
            <guid>1373122</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space can be pretty limited, so the last thing you may want is a bulky PC tower taking up half of it. A mini PC is a great solution, offering the same functionality while taking up hardly any room. Whether you’re a business owner, student, or casual user, a mini PC is ideal—and it’s usually more affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/">Take a look here: the GMKtec Mini NucBox G5 PC is typically priced at $260, but right now, it’s available at a 31% discount, bringing it down to just $180—saving you $80.</a></p>
<p>This compact device measures just 2.83 x 2.83 x 1.75 inches, making it small enough to fit in your pocket. It’s powered by an Intel 12th-generation Alder Lake N97 processor, capable of reaching speeds up to 3.6GHz. This should be more than enough for everyday tasks like web browsing, light creative work, software development, or playing casual games. It comes with 12GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which you can upgrade to as much as 2TB if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With Wi-Fi 5 support, you can enjoy fast upload and download speeds when connected to a Wi-Fi 5 network. The mini PC also features Bluetooth 5.0, making it easy to connect to various accessories. Ports include two USB 3.2 slots on the front and one on the back, plus a USB-C port. The HDMI output supports up to 4K resolution at 60Hz, and with dual HDMI ports, you can connect two displays at once—no need for a docking station. There’s also an AUX jack for connecting headphones or desktop speakers.</p>
<h2>Why Choose a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re living in a small apartment or sharing a space with roommates, you probably know that every inch of your desk matters. A large PC tower can take up precious room that you may not be willing to sacrifice. A mini PC, on the other hand, offers a lot of the capabilities of a desktop PC but in a much smaller footprint. This one is even small enough that you could feasibly mount it to the back of a monitor, so it effectively would have no foot print at all.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also make great multimedia players. While many modern TVs have smart features with the ability to play from apps like Netflix and Hulu, a mini PC can still make for a better option that just using what’s built into your TV. It’s a full Windows device, meaning it can handle more types of media formats (especially for locally saved files) than your typical smart TV or streaming stick.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mini PC is perfect for running a PLEX server, allowing you to access your media library from anywhere. They’re also great for emulating retro games, as they don’t require much processing power to run ROMs. Just make sure you legally own the games you are emulating, but also I’m not the one checking up on you. You do you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank">Welcome to <em>Total War: MEDIEVAL III</em></a> – Game Director Pawel Wojs</strong></p><p>Hi <em>Total War</em> Community!</p><p>Here we go, the first official blog about <em>Total War: MEDIEVAL III</em>.</p><p>First and foremost, welcome to TotalWar.com and the <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> hub, our official space where we will discuss anything and everything related to the game.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>My name is Pawel Wojs, I’m the game director for this exciting project and I’m here to kick off a series of blogs about our early vision for it. This is a series we know means a lot to many of you, and having personally worked on <em>MEDIEVAL II</em> almost 20 years ago, it’s beyond my wildest dreams that I get to lead the team bringing its sequel to life.</p><p>Our intention for announcing this early is simple; <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> is important to us, and we know it’s important to you, so we want to give you the opportunity to get a bit closer to it. Our goal is to talk to you more about what we’re working on and why we’re doing it. It is a very new way for us to communicate about these early phases of game development, but we’re excited to take you on the journey.</p><p>The main purpose of this hub is to share news &amp; updates on our progress and it’s a place where we’ll discuss parts of the game directly with you. We’re expecting to have updates on a roughly quarterly basis as development at this stage is very fast moving, so this will allow us to present ideas that are more likely to stand the test of time. If you want to be involved in the conversation, please feel free to sign up.</p><p>So, let’s dive into the big questions: What is <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>? Why is now the right time? And how are we going to bring this vision to life?</p><p>Our vision is for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> to be the definitive <em>Total War</em> sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history. We aim to set the scene by immersing you in the historical authenticity you expect from <em>Total War</em>. As you play, the world responds in ways that feel genuinely plausible. You can choose to follow the course as written in the history books or take a bold step towards rewriting it.</p><p>As development progresses, we’ll have more to show and discuss about its design direction—and in some cases, we’ll give you a voice to shape certain decisions. But game development is challenging, so we’re only going to be able to discuss certain areas when we’re confident they’re ready to be shown. Through this, we hope to provide more insight than ever before into the development of a <em>Total War</em> title. We’re going to make some mistakes, but we’re excited to make this journey with you.</p><p>Creating any <em>Total War</em> game takes time and immense effort, not just to make, but to ensure it hits the quality expected by you and us. The truth is, we’ve wanted to make this game for a very long time. We made attempts to bring it to life in the past, but we never felt we could truly do it justice.</p><p>So, what’s changed? For starters, we now have Warcore—the next evolution of our game engine. It’s unlike anything we’ve worked with before, offering a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks—all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.</p><p>We also knew it was essential to bring together the right people—a team with decades of experience and a deep understanding of what makes historical strategy so compelling. This expertise, combined with the passion of those who helped shape the series, gives us the foundation to build something truly special.</p><p>Right now, the game is in early pre-production, so think about it being years away, rather than months, meaning we’re just past the opening stages of its long journey. This phase is about laying the foundations: defining scope, prioritizing features which number in the hundreds at this stage, and shaping how our vision will translate into an unforgettable experience.</p><p>We have never talked about one of our games this early on in pre-development before, so it is a very exciting prospect for us, but of course as with anything new, we will have to expect bumps and bruises along the way, so please bear with us whilst we find our rhythm. This is particularly important when we are in the middle of big project milestones as we won’t be able to talk much, so we just want to set clear expectations for the instances in which we’re busy focusing on the game.</p><p>We still have work to do before we can show you the game in its early state, but we’re ready to talk about things like our vision, the magnificence of the medieval time-period, how we aim to bring the game to life – and of course, introduce you to our talented development team.</p><p>This means that alongside the community <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> team, we will have members of the development team chatting to everyone, so you can hear all of the juicy details directly from them.</p><p>We will also have our brilliant community moderators supporting us on the CA Community hub, so we also expect it to be a safe space and respectful for any and all to join in on the conversation. The usual community rules apply here, and we won’t tolerate any breaches of them.</p><p>To begin with, we want to start sharing our vision; from discussing the Medieval time period to game and art pillars—and why these are important foundational building blocks. While we may not talk about game features just yet, this will be a great opportunity for you all to understand a bit more about how we tackle development from the early stages. Not everything we say in the future will be major news, and some things might be light touch but still very interesting for us all to get our teeth into.</p><p>You’ll hear plenty more from me in the weeks and months ahead, but if you’re looking to know even more about what Med III truly is, click here to go straight to Our Vision for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> from creative director Leif Walter, and learn all about our vision for this game.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and welcome to the <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> team!</p><p>—Pawel Wojs, Game Director</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank">Our Vision</a> – Creative Director Leif Walter</strong></p><p>Hey everyone, Leif here, creative director on <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>.</p><p>I’m sure we all have our “origin story” of how we became fans of this franchise. For me, it was writing and reading “After <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Reports” on TWCenter back in the day. I always felt like <em>Total War</em> shines the most when it works as a powerful story generator. We all love the strategy in it, the tactics, going through the details of leading a realm. But it really comes together when the game tells awesome stories.</p><p>These stories exist in a variety of forms; from retelling history and reliving pivotal moments, to diverging from history and telling your own story. Your own timeline where your realm took over the Mediterranean. Memories of the great generals and politicians, key decisions made and fates being changed.</p><p>With <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>, we want to push this further than ever before. Our guiding motto is “Rewrite History”. We want to create the ultimate medieval sandbox where the outset is defined by impeccable authenticity, but from there, the story is yours to tell. We want to empower you to do this in more meaningful ways than ever before, leaving less to pure ‘head canon’, and instead giving you more ways to influence the world, while also creating greater opportunity for how the world will speak back to you and react to your actions.</p><p>We want you to shape the history of a realm throughout the medieval era, and embark to tell fantastic stories, write alternate histories, or relive the pivotal moments of medieval history.</p><p>Imagine for a moment like this:</p><p>The year is 1187.</p><p>You defend Jerusalem against Saladin; the Kingdom of Jerusalem prevails.</p><p>Constantinople is never sacked; the Byzantine Empire never falls. With the Byzantines as your allies, you defeat the Mongols.</p><p>In 1412, the Holy Roman Empire disintegrates into small, German kingdoms.</p><p>As the Kingdom of Jerusalem, you proclaim yourself defender of the Catholic church, and Jerusalem becomes the capital of the Christian world.</p><p>Trade with India and Asia blossoms.</p><p>Columbus never sails to America…</p><p>This is what <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> is all about: You pick a realm, seize your glory, and rewrite history—or kneel before it!</p><p>Of course, this is only one of many possible stories we want players to tell within the sandbox of <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>, but it is still a great example of the vision we have for the player fantasy.</p><p>We want you to feel like being the Architect of Feudal Realms. The realm—your faction—is really almost like the main character in an <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> game. It’s the “build” of your campaign that will allow you to forge your own legacy throughout the era.</p><p>Imagine, London, 1318. A fictious king of a Danish dynasty, Ragnar IV, has ascended your throne as the ruler of England. Yet you decide to abolish the monarchy and call out a League of Free Cities of England. And as England is now entering a hypothetical second Viking Age, your prosperous urban centres will dominate European trade for centuries to come…</p><p>What version of England will you create?</p><p>To do all of this, we want you to become a master of grand strategy, where foresight, planning, and the exploitation of interlocking systems is rewarded.</p><p>Imagine, Cairo, 1352. As Mamluk Egypt, your trade relations with Venice have lead to Italian enclaves along coastal trade towns. Contrary to history though, you decide to promote Italian culture through lawmaking and reforms. Thirty years later, Italian General Nicolo di Brindisi, now Grand Marshal of Egypt, is leading a mixed force of Mamluk cavalry and Italian Crossbowmen to defend the realm against the Timurids…</p><p>How will you exploit decisions across decades?</p><p>And once you go into battle, we want to make sure you feel like a real leader of your soldiers. <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter the tides of morale, discipline, and evolving battlefields.</p><p>Imagine, Manzikert, 1221. Leading your byzantine army into battle, your right flank is suffering from high fatigue, and on the left, your light infantry is being pushed back by heavy enemy troops. But when the rain starts, dirt turns into mud. The enemy sends in a last group of reserves to crush your retreating troops. Yet in the forming mud, and bolstered by your General’s presence, your light infantry withstands the charge in a heroic brace. A park in the darkest hour that ripples through your army and starts to turn the tide in battle…</p><p>Can you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat?</p><p>And finally, we want you to be the manipulator of the world as a stage. The medieval world is your canvas, and you are the agent of change across realms, and of the world itself.</p><p>Imagine, Riga, 1278. As the Teutonic Order, you are leading the Baltic crusade. You deforest regions to stimulate timber trade and found new cities to attract settlers from Western Europe. Farmland and mines expand on the map through your decree. You build new castles on the map to fortify your new home. Central European architecture spreads to the Baltic.</p><p>Your presence will transform cultures, cities, and the land itself.</p><p>All in all, we want you to think about:</p><p>What kind of kingdom will you create?</p><p>What dynasties will lead it?</p><p>And what peoples will inhabit it?</p><p>So, there you go! This is the creative vision for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> and our experiential north star. Whenever we are in discussions within the team; whenever we are considering a variety of options – we come back to this north star. Will this feature help us deliver this vision? Which version of it will contribute the most towards it? And equally, for the conversations here with all of you, it would be great to calibrate ourselves around this vision, too.</p><p>How do YOU want to rewrite history?</p><p>Ultimately, this is what we want all of you to experience. We want you to experience a sandbox that carries the signature blend of <em>Total War</em>, where immersive tactical battles blend with your campaign story to shape kingdoms, religions, cultures, and estates. A sandbox to rewrite history across the turbulent centuries of medieval history.</p><p>I would be thrilled to hear some of the great campaign and battle stories you were able to tell in the past, and what you would be looking for with <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>—Leif Walter, Creative Director</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/total-war-medieval-iii-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Creative Assembly has revealed Total War: Medieval 3, a new game in the long-running strategy series that's returning to its historical roots to celebrate its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The second Medieval game was released back in 2006 - since then, the studio has explored multiple time periods and civilisations (most recently Ancient Egypt in Total War: Pharoah), as well as multiple games in the fantastical Warhammer universe.</p>
<p>This newly-announced third Medieval game is currently in pre-production, so there's no release date yet. Creative Assembly promises it will be the "ultimate medieval strategy sandbox" and allows players to "immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before", while its mix of historical authenticity and "unprecedented player agency" mean this isn't just a sequel but "the rebirth of historical Total War".</p>

<p>It certainly sounds ambitious. You can check out the trailer above.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Creative Assembly hasn't forgotten its Warhammer games, which will celebrate their tenth anniversary in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 - Lords of the End Times will be released next summer, introducing four new Legendary Lords into the campaign experience. The first of these is Nagash, the great necromancer.</p>
<p>A free End Times Update is also planned, which will transform the campaign with new scenarios and cataclysmic events. The studio also noted this isn't the end for its Warhammer series, however.</p>

<p>In further news, the studio has developed its proprietary game engine, with a new evolution called Warcore. Not only does this offer more advanced tools for its developers, it means future games will be released on PlayStation and Xbox in addition to PC.</p><p>Lastly, another new game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards next week. It will be the next major release in the series and is "one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history". Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a report suggested the studio was working on Total War: Star Wars</a>, so could this be revealed?</p>
<p>"It's incredible to think Total War is 25 years old," said Roger Collum, vice president of Total War.</p>
<p>"We're extremely grateful that we get to make games that our community get to play for decades, and without them we wouldn't be here. This year was a moment where all Total War fans; old or new, historical or fantasy, could come together and celebrate the exciting next chapter in our story. Here's to 25 more years!"</p>
<p>After the release of Total War: Pharoah, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">studio apologised for "missteps" and offered partial refunds</a> to players. That followed the high profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">cancellation of looter shooter Hyenas</a>. As such, the studio is now returning to its roots, perhaps in an attempt to garner goodwill from its players.</p>

<p>A long time coming</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It has been eight years since Nintendo first announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>. It has been 18 years since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>. And now, after all that time, Beyond's launch trailer is finally here.</p>
<p>Those who have kept up with every trailer drop until now won't find too much new footage in this one, but we challenge anyone who's been waiting for the best part of a decade to watch without feeling a little tingle down their spine.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a bit more story-based than we've seen in previous trailers, with a gritty narration teeing up Samus' might and narrative predicament, before a boatload of sequences show her in action. And stick around until the end for a particularly mysterious stinger!</p>
<p>The game has launched today on Switch and Switch 2. On the new hardware, we described Prime 4 as "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, and our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">impressions of the Switch 1 version</a> were equally optimistic, despite the resolution drop.</p>

            <guid>1373086</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bad Robot Games have announced a partnership to create a new game together. SIE will publish Bad Robot’s first internal game project, which is to be a four-player cooperative shooter directed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> designer Mike Booth. The game is in development for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe,” said Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games. “With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.”</p>


<p>Booth has been at Bad Robot Games since December 2020, and has been Chief Creative Officer since 2022, managing the company’s in-house game developments. Booth is obviously most famous for his work in creating Left 4 Dead, at Turtle Rock Studios which he had founded in 2002. He stayed with Valve for a couple years after Turtle Rock was shut down and refounded separately, but left in 2012, joined Blizzard for a time, worked on social VR projects with Facebook in the late 2010s, and eventually landed with Bad Robot in 2020.</p>
<p>Which is to say that, while he was there for the beginning of Left 4 Dead and the co-op shooter genre, he’s not been involved with later attempts at this and adjacent genres – Turtle Rock went on to create Evolve and Back 4 Blood, but neither saw the same level of success and stature as Left 4 Dead. Can Booth, who created the AI Director that managed the dynamic ebb and flow of zombie attacks and monsters through the game, come up with a fresh perspective and hook to revolutionise the co-op shooter all over again?</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

It's a cyberpunk story, so obviously, the corporation has a sinister agenda.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Replaced </em>appears to be paying homage to the cinematic platformers of time gone by; think <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, <em>Out of This World </em>(also known as <em>Another World</em>), and <em>Flashback</em>, and you'll be roughly in the right ballpark.</p><p>The game will blend exploration with "fluid movement and fast, responsive combat" in which you'll use both melee and ranged options to take down your enemies.</p>

<p>Edery told Game File that his studio is "grateful" for its time under the auspices of Netflix, which will still publish <em>Spirit Crossing </em>on mobile. The studio will, however, be free to ask other publishers to take the game on for other platforms, which Edery says is "truly the best thing" for the project.</p><p>Netflix isn't the only streaming giant to be taking a long, hard look at its role in the gaming industry. Back in October, Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced a major overhaul</a> to its Luna streaming service, which involved a refocusing on party games and smartphone-based play.</p><p>The retail giant also revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">end development on MMORPG <em>New World</em></a>, with several staffers in Amazon's gaming division also losing their jobs as a result of that decision.</p>
<p>Spry Fox's split from Netflix doesn't seem to have affected the studio's plans in the near term; <em>Spirit Crossing </em>is still in development, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>remains available <a href="https://cozygrovegame.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">across PC and consoles</a>, with versions of <em>Spirit Crossing </em>for those platforms also seemingly in the works.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-razer-customizable-gaming-keypad-to-its-lowest-price-as-stock-runs-out-2000650248</link>
            <guid>1373068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday having passed, you might be thinking times up for finding great deals on tech and gaming stuff. But oh, my friend, you could not be more wrong. Amazon still has a number of deals still active following the huge savings weekend. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/">For instance, this Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad went on sale just before Black Friday to its lowest price on record and has remained since</a>. The gaming keypad usually goes for $80, so that 25% ends up chopping off $20—bringing the price you pay to only $60. No telling when the price will jump back up, so if you’re still shopping for the right gift for your gamer pal or are just looking to upgrade your own gaming setup, now’s the time to do it.</p>
<p>Let’s chat about mice, keyboard and controller for a moment. For some genres, the best way to play is obvious. A real-time strategy game? That’s gotta be mouse and keyboard. Racing games? Need to go with controller for those analog triggers. Though, some genres are debatable—particularly the first-person shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With a mouse, you have pin-point control over your aim, able to accelerate naturally, as fast as you can move the mouse. And yet, movement is limited. the W, A, S, D, control scheme doesn’t allow for precise control over your walking speed. Plus you’re limited to exactly eight directions of movement.</p>
<p>On controller, you can decide how fast you move, and have a full 360-degree range of movement with the left analog stick. However, your view relies on the right analog stick, which can only turn so fast and offers a much more limited control.</p>
<h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>Hannah Montanna knew best. You need the best of both worlds—and the Razer Tartarus V2 is just that.</p>
<p>The Tartarus looks like someone hacked up a keyboard and glued a joy-stick to the side (complimentary). With it, you now have a directional thumbpad for more natural controls, closer to what console-oriented players are used to. And then your remaining four fingers can still have access to all the keys you need. There’s also a scroll wheel.</p>



<p>The Razer Tartarus V2 features 32 mecha-membrane keys. They provide the tactile feedback and satisfaction of pressing down a mechanical key. They are are individually programmable so you can set it however you like to support your gaming or for use in creative workflows such as video or photo editing. You can even program macros, allowing for multiple key and keypress combinations in order to execute complex commands.</p>
<p>The gaming keypad is built with an ergonomic palm rest which is both adjustable and detachable, so you can customize your set up to whatever best matches your preferences and comfort.</p>
<p>And it of course would not be a proper Gamer with a capital G accessory without proper RGB lighting. The Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad offers full Razer Chroma supports. You can have the keypad fully synchronize with the game you’re playing or even with your Philips Hue lights if you’d got them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525</link>
            <guid>1373065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The analysts have seen enough: <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s having a bad year</a>. Also <em>Helldivers 2</em> is sending players into lava pits and a major <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan game gets another understandable delay. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s a big day for new game releases with <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-kotaku-review-2000650015"><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em></a> all coming out at the same time. I wish I could find the time! Instead, I’ll be busy facing new bosses in<a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigh-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launch-time-patch-notes-2000650150"><em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC</a> and muddling my way through a good but all-too-brief new <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488"><em>Destiny 2 Star Wars</em> campaign</a> called&nbsp;<em>Renegades</em>.</p> <h2>The biggest<em> Elder Scrolls</em> mod project going gets another delay</h2>  <p><em>Skyblivion</em>, to almost no one’s surprise, won’t make its planned 2025 release date after all. The long-standing fan project that recreates <em>The Elder Scrolls IV</em> inside <em>Skyrim</em> using the latter’s engine needs a bit more time to cook. Considering it’s the work of over 70 unpaid volunteers, I think the wait is understandable. Plus, it will give it more of a buffer from Bethesda’s own <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> launch earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>Sony is publishing JJ Abrams’ production company’s first game developed by Left 4 Dead’s director</h2> <p>It’s a buzzy mouthful indeed. Here’s the press release: “Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) today announced a partnership with video game studio Bad Robot Games, a division of Bad Robot, the film, television and theater production company founded by JJ Abrams, for SIE to produce and publish the studio’s upcoming project, an unannounced four-player, cooperative shooter directed by Mike Booth&nbsp;<em>(Left 4 Dead</em>).”</p>

 <p>The game will come to PS5 and PC, but there’s currently no other information known about it. Maybe a tease at The Game Awards?</p> <h2>“Fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before”</h2> <p>That’s according to Chris Dring of<em> The Game Business</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">who spoke to<em> Eurogamer</em></a> about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-player-count-battlefield-6-2000646316">relative crickets</a> around <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s launch. Activision hasn’t shared any hard data on player counts or sales figures, though the metrics analysts are tracking and estimating sound much worse than usual.</p>

 <p>“But actually, I track daily active users, and all year <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s numbers have been quite low-lower than usual. There have been some exceptions though, January was great coming off <em>Black Ops 6</em>, there was a boost in April / May, but generally speaking, fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before,” Dring said. “That’s despite <em>Black Ops 6</em> as the previous game being brilliant in people’s eyes. In fact, in September, it was the lowest point I’ve seen <em>Call of Duty</em> since the launch of their <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>.”</p>

 <p>He and Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot blame a lack of innovation, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">bad, always-online campaign</a>, poor marketing, lots of competition in the shooter space, and general franchise burnout for the lackluster response. Will any of that actually stop <em>Black Ops 7</em> from being one of this year’s top-sellers? <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644">Probably not</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> just got lava planets</h2>  <p>The extraction shooter’s latest “Into the Unjust” update has taken players into a fight with the automatons on <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s version of <em>Mustafar. “</em>Too hot for humans, too unstable for farming, too explosive for tourism—yet rich in minerals,” reads the description. “Minerals the Automatons steal with every drill. Their unsanctioned mining not only threatens humanity’s expansion, but the very survival of managed democracy itself.”</p>

 <h2>The AI bubble continues to threaten gaming</h2> <p>SSD and RAM maker Micron announced it’s getting out of the consumer business to focus on manufacturing for companies’ AI computing needs. “The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,” said Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>The news comes as wider RAM shortages seem poised to jack up the prices of PC and console gaming even further, with pricing pressure hitting companies like AMD which is already the confirmed tech partner for PlayStation 6, Steam Machine, and the next-gen Xbox.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima will talk about going indie at GDC 2026</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was named the keynote speaker for a talk titled “Restarting from Zero: A Message to Creators Considering Independence.” Scheduled to kick off GDC’s revamped “Festival of Gaming” taking place March 9 through 13, the presentation is expected to detail the famed developer’s journey after leaving Konami and the “pitfalls” his team overcame after starting from scratch.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-aerith-voice-actor-smut-2000650164"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s voice actor is tired of being sent Aerith porn&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-llm-chatgpt-steam-2000650074">Generative AI NPCs are getting tricked with sex prompts&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-new-grinch-meal-shaker-shake-fries-pickle-holiday-christmas-meal-2000650144">McDonalds has new fries and they’re actually very, very good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m74irgumzc2z" rel="nofollow ">On BlueSky</a>, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">the Nex Playground</a> at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74irgumzc2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia322nlfoz43oosiekrrqcbmwxxttuaf4ixdbpj5d5fj4t7oj3k4u" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

  </div><p dir="ltr">In fact, this isn't the first time Nex Playground has upped Sony's system in the US for a short time. In July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nex-playground-active-play-system-video-game-console-deal/1100-6527044/">the cubed console went on sale for Prime Day</a> and sold more units over the past month than any PS5 option on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Nex Playground relies on motion-based movement for players. In other words, this console is very similar to Xbox Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. Nex Playground comes with five titles installed, and owners can purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games.
