			<p>Microsoft has had to pause issuing the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-windows-11-24h2-download-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Windows 11 24H2</a> update to users who have certain Ubisoft games installed on their PCs as the games become unresponsive. Here's the blurb from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help article</a>:</p>
<p><em>After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games. These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading, or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>​Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em></a><br>
<em>​Assassin's Creed Origins</em><br>
<em>​Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em><br>
<em>​Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
<em>​<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></em><br>
<em>Note: Ubisoft released a temporary mitigation for Star Wars Outlaws to prevent the game from failing and stop responding. You might still experience some performance issues.</em></p>
<p><em>To safeguard your Microsoft Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed. These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel. IT administrators using Windows Update for Business reports can check these issues using the following safeguard IDs: 54437462 and 54580160.</em></p>
<p><em>Important: We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved</em>.</p>
<p>If you are already affected by the issue, the best workaround is simply to close down the game via the Task Manager if it has hung up. Microsoft and Ubisoft are currently working on a solution, and we'll update this story once it becomes available.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-everything-we-know">Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl</a> has been in the wild for almost a week now, and it’s a great, if predictably somewhat shonky time, is the word on the street. Literally, that’s what the streets are saying. “It’s good! A bit shonky, though!” opined my postman this morning, enunciating each syllable by yanking the package further from my grasp. “Don’t worry!” I said. “A patch for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> is coming next week”. “That’s cheered me right up, that has! Thank god for games journalists!” he replied. Then the whole street started cheering and bringing me various baked goods. It was a delicious time, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415">here’s the notes </a>from the delicious patch:</p>

<li>A-Life system bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a fair few key issues targeted, which is reassuring, although I do get the sense the series’ history with bugs has primed the audience to be a little more forgiving this time around - understandable given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">extraordinary circumstances</a> that GSC Game World faced during development. Personally, I only have one request: please do not patch out this guy’s dodgy teeth:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/stalker-2-teeth.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>GSC/Gameranx</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’m not sure if the screenshot fully conveys what I’m talking about here, so do have a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/YAoWRJ27S7E?t=156">Gameranx video</a> where I found the footage. And, yes, I admit this is a strange thing to get excited about, but I’m genuinely happy to see such imperfect, yellowing (even if it’s partially the flashlight) teeth in a game. It’s the sort of realistic touch that feels incredibly minor until you realise just how few games actually do it. Like, I say 'dodgy', but they're not even dodgy, really. They're just a normal bloke's normal, imperfect teeth.</p><p>I haven’t spent enough time with the game yet to tour its full menagerie of miscoloured mouths, although after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">reviewing the game</a>, James tells me that dodgy teeth aren’t too rare, if not exactly common. I may have honed in on this lad’s gnashers specifically because I’d so recently been blinded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>’s pearly whiteout, even though its far from the first game to be populated by bizarrely blemish-free inhabitants. It’s the sort of manicured unreality that’s so common I don’t even tend to notice it until something like Heart of Chornobyl comes along with characters that look well and truly worn out. More bad teeth, I say. More scars in uncool places, more stretch marks. I’m serious!</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While the mainstream success of Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> is undeniable, developer Larian has yet to announce a sales figure. But after financial records for last year were made public, we finally have an idea of just how big Baldur’s Gate 3 really was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from financial records posted by the Dublin, Ireland holding company for Larian, which is ostensibly based in Belgium, and controlled by majority shareholder, founder, and CEO Swen Vincke. (Ireland is one of the world’s most significant tax havens, with corporate tax revenues exploding in the country over the last decade.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a paywalled report by the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Independent</a>, Larian posted a €249 million (approx $260.9 million) pre-tax profit for 2023, which included the August release of Baldur’s Gate 3. Revenue for the year hit €427 million (approx $447.5 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian has never announced a sales figure for Baldur’s Gate 3, although publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1761874915752325387" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated in February</a> that the game had sold well over 10 million copies, and Hasbro, the parent company of Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast, said in March that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-has-made-90-million-for-hasbro">Baldur's Gate 3 had earned it $90 million due to its licensing deal with Larian</a>. The Irish Independent reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 had sold around 15 million copies and paid out a €28 million dividend this year as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian’s bumper 2023 financial results are in stark contrast to the company’s 2022, which saw a loss of €214,000 (approx $224,100) off the back of just €22.7 million (approx $23.7 million) in revenue. Baldur’s Gate 3’s wild success, then, was a game-changer for Larian, and that’s without taking into consideration the ongoing sales Baldur’s Gate 3 has pulled in so far in 2024. Indeed, Douse has said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods">Baldur’s Gate 3 has 20% more active daily users this year than last</a>, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview">the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Irish Independent confirmed that while Vincke owns virtually all the ordinary shares in Larian’s Dublin holding company, Chinese megacorp Tencent owns a “large chunk” of preference shares in the firm via its Tencent Cloud Europe division.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t Larian’s only hit game, of course, but its success is a magnitude higher than that of its previous RPGs, including Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2. Larian opened multiple development studios around the world to aid with the development of Baldur’s Gate 3 as part of its “following the sun” concept of 24-hour game development, with teams handing off work to the next time zone at the end of their work day to speed up development. In addition to Dublin, Larian has studios in Kuala Lumpur, Barcelona, Guildford, Quebec, Warsaw, and its original home of Ghent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Dungeon party game King of Meat will host an invite-only alpha this December, and you can sign up now.</p>
<p>Announced at Summer Game Fest, King of Meat is the debut game from studio Glowmade (comprising ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers), with publishing from Amazon Games. It tasks players with creating outlandish dungeons and then completing them with others in online co-op.</p>
<p>The alpha will take place from 4th December to 14th December for PC (Steam) and Xbox Series X/S players in North America and Europe (the test will be in English only).</p>

<p>The alpha will include both dungeon creation and gameplay, giving players a well-rounded look at what to expect in the full release. You can take a look at gameplay in the above brand new explainer trailer.</p>
<p>There's currently no proper release date for the game, though it's expected to launch across PS5 and Switch alongside PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The test itself is called<a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha"> Lights, Camera, Alpha!</a> due to the TV show framework of the game, with this essentially being the pilot episode. The game is full of irreverent and silly humour as players take part in a televised gameshow to increase their fame.</p>
<p>You'd certainly expect that sort of humour from the developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> and Fable, though. I got to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">hands-on with King of Meat</a> earlier in the year and had a fun time with its chaotic action.</p>

            <p>Larian has reportedly posted a €249m (£207m) pre-tax profit for 2023. This is, of course, thanks in no small part to the runaway success of the Dungeons and Dragon's-based <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html">Irish Independent</a> [paywall], this bumper figure was shared within financial records posted by the Belgium-based holding company for Larian. The publication notes Larian had previously reported a loss of €214k (£178k), before Baldur's Gate 3 took the world by storm.</p>
<p>At the time of its publication, the Irish Independent stated Larian had sold approximately 15m copies of Baldur's Gate 3, and was able to pay out a €28m (£23m) dividend this year as a result of this. While Larian itself has never shared sales figures, earlier this year it was suggested that over 10m copies had been sold since Baldur's Gate 3's debut.</p>
<p>Larian's game was released on PC in August of 2023, before arriving on additional platforms. While of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-already-has-one-of-steams-highest-concurrent-player-counts-ever">being a hit on launch</a>, and going on to secure itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">swathes of industry praise and awards</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 has continued to prove popular.</p><p>Earlier this month, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year</a>. Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year.</p>
<p>Larian is still supporting Baldur's Gate 3 (the studio recently secured itself a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nomination for Best Community Support at this year's Game Awards</a>). However, it also has other irons in the fire. The studio previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before it ultimately decided to try something new instead. </p>
<p>
Larian is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sony is developing a portable version of the PlayStation 5, according to a new report. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg</a> states that Sony's portable PS5 project is still in the "early stages" and might not ultimately reach the market.
</p>
<p>
However, Sony is reportedly keen to re-enter the handheld gaming market and compete with Nintendo Switch. In reality, that means with Nintendo's still-under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">which is expected to launch next year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sony already has a portable device capable of playing PS5 games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">the PlayStation Portal</a> - although this is limited to playing streamed games only (initially from your own PS5 console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">though now also via the cloud</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, Bloomberg states that Sony's initial plans for the PlayStation Portal were for it to function as a standalone device, akin to the Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>Such a device would also help Sony bridge the gap between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, its recent mid-gen console refresh, and the inevitable PS6, which isn't expected until nearer the end of the decade.</p>
<p>
PlayStation is, of course, no stranger to handheld gaming. The PSP constituted the only serious competition Nintendo ever had in the portable console market, and sold more than 76m units. But its successor, the PlayStation Vita, fared less well - and reportedly sold around 16m units.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-all-but-confirms-plans-for-xbox-portable-console">also has plans to launch an Xbox handheld</a>. Speaking this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said his company's device was also several years away</a>, however.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review.1044333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a> and the sandbox survival boom of the early 2010s, the genre has continued to morph and expand, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/towers-of-aghasba">Towers of Aghasba</a> being its latest offering. Where some survival games have leaned more towards horror (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-forest">The Forest</a>) and others have delved into mythology (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/valheim">Valheim</a>), there are some common tropes throughout, one being a feeling of isolation. Wandering across Aghasba can sure feel lonely at times – albeit in a mysterious, enchanting way – yet one of this game’s highlights is how lived in the game world feels.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTP0rbaw2SQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You wash up on its shores accompanied by myriad members of your tribe, the Shimu. You’ve set sail from Lehorra on a quest to restore the Shimu’s ancestral homeland of Aghasba, pursued by a sinister force known only as the Withered. Instead of having you fend for yourself and create your own emergent survival odyssey, Towers of Aghasba features story-driven quests that help inject its world with colour and character while showing you the ropes.</p>


<p>Ropes are pretty handy, actually, as are sticks, stones, and other basic materials you begin to gather. In true survival sandbox fashion, these can be combined to create basic tools such axes and shovels that then allow you to extract an increasingly diverse array of components and turn those into even more advanced tools and so on. This gameplay loop is near enough set in stone though Towers of Aghasba offers plenty of refinements and deviations to keep things fresh.</p>


<p>One of the Towers of Aghasba’s unique features is its focus on nurturing ecosystems. It’s fair to say the Shimu are a little miffed when they discover that their homeland is nothing more than a dusty, arid wasteland and not the bountiful paradise they were promised. Thankfully they’ve brought a giant magical seed with them that, when planted, births a colossal tree surrounded by verdant green pastures. With it comes new resources to sustain the Shimu as well as various forms of wildlife.</p>
<p>Needless to say, taking care of these ecosystems is vital, but just to emphasise that, a gruff-voiced seedling instructs you to plant seeds, feed animals, and fend off the Withered. In doing so you’ll earn Amity, a nature-infused energy that can be spent on expanding your ecosystems further while also serving as a very loose morality mechanic. Positive actions, such as tending to a wounded animal, will grant Amity whereas hunting that same animal will deplete it. Instead of trying to force players to avoid negative actions, Towers of Aghasba accepts that a balance must be maintained – skinning a Beetlepup is nasty work, yet the meat, hide, and bones will give life to the Shimu.</p>
<p>Hunting, as well as other forms of combat, are fairly simple in this early access version of the game. After establishing your first settlement, you are given a spear, a bow, and a handful of arrows, perfect for fighting the spider-like Withered that can kill you in a couple of hits if you’re not paying attention. Melee attacks are bound to a single button with the added ability to dodge, whereas ranged weapons adopt familiar aim-and-shoot controls. It’s not terribly dynamic, but it serves its purpose with scope for more advanced forms of weapon to appear later in the game.</p>
<p>Navigating Aghasba is similarly straightforward when starting out. You’ll quickly notice just how uneven the terrain is with its many small mountains and valleys though your innate climbing skills will make short work of them. You can stick to just about any surface as well as Spider-Man (or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Link</a>), ascending so long as your stamina bar doesn’t run out. It’s well worth breaking from the beaten path and exploring as Aghasba hides many secrets to uncover.</p>

<p>Going back to the Shimu, they’re not exactly the sort to sit back and let a young wanderer do all the hard work. In this early access build, they won’t actively help gather resources, craft, or join in combat, but they will build (once given the requisite materials) and offer valuable information, usually via tutorial quests. Within a couple of hours of starting, you’ll have a bustling village and the blueprint to all sorts of upgrades and add-ons including tents, campfires, storage bins, and even a farm. While some survival game fans relish in building their basecamps brick by brick, being able to plop down a prefab settlement removes some of that tedious busywork.</p>
<p>Towers of Aghasba is an approachable gateway into the genre that doesn’t hold back on features while introducing some quirks of its own. Its mystical setting is also deeply alluring, inviting you to unearth ancient secrets while restoring life to Aghasba’s derelict landscape.</p>

			<p>Sony is reportedly in the initial stages of developing a new PlayStation 5 handheld console that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. The surprising news comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, which cites anonymous sources and also clarifies that the plans have not been finalized. The console may not even ever make it to the market. This puts it roughly on par with what we know about Microsoft's Xbox handheld. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it is being made but also added it is years away.</p>
<p>Sony has a long history of making PlayStation handhelds, of course. The first one they produced was the PlayStation Portable, colloquially known as PSP, which launched between late 2004 and early 2005 across the world as a competitor to the Nintendo DS. The PSP was well received and Sony managed to sell a lot of units (76.4 million units as of 2012, the latest public figure), although not nearly as many as the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>They tried again with the PlayStation Vita, which debuted between late 2011 (Japan) and 2012 (North America and Europe). However, the PS Vita was, by and large, a commercial failure, leading to the decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-stopped-first-party-titles-ps-vita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon</a> first-party game development for the platform in 2015.</p>
<p>Sony kind of revived its handheld tradition with the PlayStation Portal, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this year to seemingly solid sales. However, the Portal is only dedicated to streaming games via cloud. Interestingly, the Bloomberg article reports that was not always the case, as Sony had previously considered making it more like Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> by Moore's Law Is Dead earlier this year suggests that Sony would once again partner with AMD on this new hardware. That report mentioned compatibility with both PS4 and PS5 games, although Bloomberg only mentions that it will be a PlayStation 5 handheld. The latter option seems more likely: considering that the hardware is still a few years away, supporting PlayStation 4 games wouldn't really make sense at that point.</p>

The Hylian Shield and Master Sword from Ocarina of Time are emblazoned on the left grip. The off-white base color is accented by blue face buttons and triggers that match Link's shield. The red Hylian Crest in the center of the controller is a nice touch.</p><p dir="ltr">As for its technical features, the controller has two back buttons that can be remapped on the fly, which is a nice perk, especially in this price range. Since it connects via Bluetooth, you can also use it on PC and mobile devices. The controller does have an unusual quirk, though: It's powered by AA batteries. Your first pair is included, and you should get roughly 30 hours of playtime before you need to swap them out. Plus, you could always opt for rechargeable batteries, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Rechargeable-Auto-Safety-Over-charge-Protection/dp/B00IM3P8GS?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this Energizer kit with four batteries included for only $15 (50% off)</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Third-party Switch controllers don't have NFC readers for Amiibo or HD rumble--this controller lacks rumble altogether.

<p>Sony is gearing up to enter the handheld console market. A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> states that Sony is developing a portable handheld console that would allow people to play their PlayStation 5 (PS5) games while on the go.</p>



<p>According to the report, development on this new system is in the “early stages”.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“Sony’s portable device is likely years away from launch and the company could still decide against bringing it to market, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private plans,” the report reads.</p>



<p>It’s said that the development “builds on the PlayStation Portal”. As opposed to playing games via streaming them from the console over the internet, however, this new device will be an actual console that is aiming at competing with the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo’s upcoming Switch successor. Bloomberg adds that sources told them that Sony’s original plan for the Portal was for it to work as a standalone system “like Valve’s Steam Deck” before it became the streaming device it is.</p>



<p>Sony declined to comment to Bloomberg on the report.</p>



<p>In addition to PlayStation developing a handheld console, Microsoft is also working on their own handheld to tap into the market. Xbox boss Phil Spencer says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-confirmed-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their handheld is still “years away”</a>.</p>

Used by the Bene Gesserit, The Voice is an almost gargled modulation of one’s natural voice that can make almost anyone do whatever they’re told. Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) made a soldier slice his partner’s throat, and made Chani (Zendaya) feed Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) a mixture of her tears and the Water of Life to revive him. In <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, young Valya Harkonnen (Jessica Barden) is revealed to be the creator of the powerful skill, first using it to force Reverend Mother Dorotea (Camilla Beeput) to stab herself in the neck in order to protect the Sisterhood’s genetic index established by Reverend Mother Raquella (Cathy Tyson).</p><p>Until this latest episode, we had never seen someone immune to The Voice’s influence. Then, again, we also hadn’t seen someone burn another person from the inside out by blowing into their mouth until Desmond Hart (Travis Fimmel) came into&nbsp;our lives. In the climatic moments of the second episode, Valya aims to reassert the Bene Gesserit’s influence over the ruling family Corrino following the death of Reverend Mother Kasha (Jihae), the Truthsayer and confidant to Emperor Javicco Corrino (Mark Strong).</p><p>Her initial attempt to do so over a private conversation with the Emperor was thwarted when Hart appeared in the Emperor’s place. That’s when she tried resorting to her go-to contingency plan for those times when people start doing silly things like using their free will: making anyone in her way kill themselves. Plus, she’d be avenging Kasha’s death—two birds with one voice. After it appeared as if her powers were working on Hart, making him take out his blade and put it to his neck, her final command for him to drive it into his throat fell on ears she never thought would ever exist. Not only did Hart not kill himself, he delivered the coldest lines ever said to a Bene Gesserit on camera:</p><p>“I always wondered what your greatest fear would be. Now I have seen it. It’s not that no one will hear you. It’s that they’ll hear you and just won’t care.”</p><figure id="" data-id="5565f661041d6149efcc4e211bf48daf" data-recommend-id="image://5565f661041d6149efcc4e211bf48daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="940" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Desmond Hart addressing an adversary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Desmond Hart addressing an adversary" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5565f661041d6149efcc4e211bf48daf" data-recommend-id="image://5565f661041d6149efcc4e211bf48daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="940" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Desmond Hart addressing an adversary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h13264"><a id=""></a>Shai-Hulud vs The Bene Gesserit</h2><p>As surprising as Hart’s defense against Valya may be, it reinforces the fact that Shai-Hulud has been around longer than The Voice. Fremen revere the sandworms as divine beings, and Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) famously said in the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune </em>saga that Shai-Hulud is the only master she serves. Bene Gesserit can’t become Reverend Mothers unless they ingest the poisonous bile or a dying sandworm, referred to as the Water of Life. It would make sense that the only way to overpower the Bene Gesserit’s strongest trait is to use the one entity responsible for them ascending to their highest position.</p><p>Remember, Hart was swallowed by Shai-Hulud and supposedly imbued with his deadly powers. Even though Hart explicitly tells Valya that his mission is to wipe out any trace of the Bene Gesserit, we know from the <em>Dune </em>movies that they remain as influential as ever 10,000 years later. What <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> just did was introduce the idea of there being people out there that could be imbued with Shai-Hulud’s powers that are threats to the Bene Gesserit. Also, it makes you wonder how the Bene Gesserit adapted to this existential threat in order to survive for as long as the have.</p><p>One thing is clear, <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> is here to shake up everything you’d learned about the <em>Dune</em> world from the movies. Have fun!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For just $138, it gets you a soundbar, wireless subwoofer, support for DTS Virtual:X, and an adaptive sound feature that automatically optimizes your audio based on the content. There’s also a game mode for improved directional audio. Toss in a remote that works with both Samsung TVs and your soundbar, Bluetooth connectivity, and a bass boost option to enhance the sound of explosions, and the HW-C450 is a great choice during Black Friday.</p><hr><h2>Samsung HW-C400/ZA 2.0 Channel C-Series Soundbar</h2><h3>$90 (was $120)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404621-d0e7a079-8736-444a-984a-cc35b6f6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404621" data-ratio="0.6669387755102" data-width="1225" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404621-d0e7a079-8736-444a-984a-cc35b6f6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404621"></a><figcaption>Samsung HW-C400/ZA 2.0 Channel C-Series Soundbar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404621-d0e7a079-8736-444a-984a-cc35b6f6.jpg"></figure><p>With a built-in subwoofer, support for Dolby Audio and DTS, and a useful “night mode” that reduces bass levels, the awkwardly named Samsung HW-C400/ZA is a decent choice at this new low price. The built-in subwoofer is especially nice for small spaces that might not have room for a wireless subwoofer.</p><hr><h2>Bose TV Soundbar</h2><h3>$199 (was $279)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404622-41eeeqrr3ml._ac_sl1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404622" data-ratio="0.564" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404622-41eeeqrr3ml._ac_sl1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404622"></a><figcaption>Bose TV Soundbar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404622-41eeeqrr3ml._ac_sl1200.jpg"></figure><p>This compact Bose soundbar is just 24 inches long, but its list of features is more impressive than you’d expect. Along with two angled full-range drivers for booming spatial audio and crisp dialogue, there’s a dedicated “dialogue mode” you can enable to make it easier to pick out words during quiet scenes. Beyond connecting to your TV, the soundbar supports Bluetooth connections--consider syncing it with your phone for your next party.</p><hr><h2>Samsung HW-Q600C 3.1.2 Channel Q-Series Soundbar</h2><h3>$330 (was $600)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404624-samsunghw-q600c3.1.2channelq-seriessoundbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404624" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404624-samsunghw-q600c3.1.2channelq-seriessoundbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404624"></a><figcaption>Samsung HW-Q600C 3.1.2 Channel Q-Series Soundbar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404624-samsunghw-q600c3.1.2channelq-seriessoundbar.jpg"></figure><p>This is one of our favorite deals for a premium soundbar, as it’s hard to beat the $270 price cut. Along with a wireless subwoofer, this soundbar supports Dolby Atmos, Q-Symphony, and offers a Game Mode Pro setting that improves its 360-degree audio. Toss in a nifty remote that works with both Samsung TVs and this soundbar, adaptive sound support for clearer dialogue, and easy setup with HDMI eARC, and it's easy to see why this is one of our favorite soundbar deals of Black Friday.</p><hr><h2>Vizio V-Series 2.0 Compact Soundbar</h2><h3>$55 (was $80)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404625-viziov-series2.0compactsoundbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404625" data-ratio="0.561" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404625-viziov-series2.0compactsoundbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404625"></a><figcaption>Vizio V-Series 2.0 Compact Soundbar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404625-viziov-series2.0compactsoundbar.jpg"></figure><p>At just 24 inches long, this Vizio is a good size for small setups. It’s also great for shoppers on a budget, as it packs in some great specs despite a price tag of just over $50. With support for Dolby Audio and DTS Virtual:X plus two full-range speakers, it should be a big improvement over most built-in TV speakers.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The GameStop near my house closed down in 2021 and I've really missed it. There's something to be said about getting to know your local GameStop staff and talking games with them for a while. I've also been seeing some locations are doing midnight launches again, and my friends, everyone should wait in line to buy a hot new game the second it goes live. You will be among your people, an unbroken queue of like-minded individuals looking to share in the communal experience of celebrating gaming. I feel like gaming culture was better when we all stood together and talked to one another about how stoked we were for Halo 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGEYb?object_uuid=f764efae-6e17-4f5c-809a-2c5128e6231d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GameStop</a> has some solid Black Friday video game deals, and if you don't mind buying used, you can actually save a bunch more. But the biggest problem is not all the deals at GameStop are as good as they are at competitors. For example, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-early-black-friday-2024">50% off Final Fantasy XVI deal</a> that's been crushing all week isn't at GameStop (it's $5 more than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024">Amazon's Black Friday</a> price). But lots of others, like Tomb Raider I-III Remaster and Sea of Stars, are the same price as they are at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-early-black-friday-video-game-deals">Best Buy's Black Friday video game sales</a>. Of course, we've been following all the deals and have a full look at all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">best Black Friday deals of 2024</a>, not JUST video game deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GameStop Best Black Friday Deals</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">X-Men '97 Magneto Helmet Black Friday Deal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Definitely want to shine some light on this one because, not only is the price of the Magneto X-Men '97 helmet discounted 55%, it's also one of the most popular items I've featured on the <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndeals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals Instagram</a> accounts this year... and it wasn't even close to this low of a price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, if you want a cosplay-quality Magneto helmet you can wear comfortably, or you just want to get it for display (it has a stand), this is probably GameStop's best Black Friday deal going right now.</p><div catalogid="fcb07082-590a-4f71-978d-04b58e741ca5" id="211095"><div id="211095" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Best GameStop Black Friday Deal So Far</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hasbro Marvel Legends Series  X-Men '97 Magneto Helmet</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Premium role-play 1:1 scale helmet with padding and adjustable size.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$39.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, the selection of $39.99 isn't exactly great. I think Lies of P is probably the stand-out here. That being said, it's still early and I would not be surprised at all if this deals page gets updated with a lot more games, but I would also not be surprised if it didn't. I'm on an even-keel here, nothing can surprise me.</p></div><div catalogid="47791507-f893-4dde-8a88-5234c4a358c9" id="211171"><div id="211171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $39.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $40 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$29.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're getting somewhere. In spite of what the page might try to make you believe, some of these games are actually cheaper than $29.99, and the selection here is pretty great, too. Stand-out games on this landing page include Mortal Kombat 1, Sea of Stars, and the absolutely excellent Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection Extended Edition. </p></div><div catalogid="89e5befb-8c13-435a-8e51-4cbda21520b2" id="211172"><div id="211172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $29.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $20-$30 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$19.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the sweet spot in my opinion. The price is excellent and the selection of $20 games on sale for Black Friday is also pretty admirable. The stand-outs here are probably Hogwart's Legacy, Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition, Lords of the Fallen and Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. But that's just my opinion – I leave it to you to find the games you want to buy. I can only lead you to them, I cannot make up your mind for you.</p></div><div catalogid="89e5befb-8c13-435a-8e51-4cbda21520b2" id="211172"><div id="211172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $29.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $20-$30 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off on Plushies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm just going to go ahead and say you should buy the Sonic the Hedgehog Ice Cream plushie. The real one has dead eyes made of bubblegum, exactly what you want to enjoy with a frozen treat. There are also a lot of non-Sonic ice cream plushies, too, like Kuromi, Gengar, Squishmallows and more.</p></div><div catalogid="9933d64d-60a9-498b-957d-9890c778f700" id="211183"><div id="211183" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Plushies</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>So many adorable new friends to bring home.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals at GameStop</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">GameStop has both the Nintendo Switch Black Friday Mario Kart bundles, and Pro members save $25, which is a nice little extra bonus savings. Other than that, these have been available since... August, I think? If you know someone who doesn't have a Switch and you're shopping at GameStop anyway, go wild.</p></div><div catalogid="f61edd28-af93-49a5-bad5-d0cf8db6529a" id="211175"><div id="211175" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Nintendo Switch Bundles</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>If you want to gamble but you hate risk, this is a sure bet. A variation of this bundle has been the Black Friday Nintendo deal since... 2018? Maybe earlier.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Should I Wait to Buy Games at GameStop's Black Friday Sale?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to buy any of the games currently listed on sale, I say go for it. If anything, it'll just add more games as the shopping event heats up. Definitely get on that Sonic plush, though. Who knows how long it will last? It will definitely be worth waiting for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-a-playstation-5">best time to buy a PS5</a>, though, because it's not currently listed, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Sony has announced its Black Friday deals</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/24/24304977/movie-trailers-mincraft-elio-alien-earth-star-wars-outlaws-wild-card-how-to-train-your-dragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, I went to a theater to watch a showing of the black-and-white version of <em>Johnny Mnemonic, </em>starring Keanu Reeves. Old-heads like me may recall it as a bad mid-90s cyberpunk film (written by William Gibson!) about a data courier whose brain is the storage medium, but who had to have his childhood memories erased to make space for the work. </p><p>I hadn’t seen it since I was a kid, and you know what? It’s still not a good movie. But if you ignore the plot holes, mostly awful acting, and terrible pacing, it’s at least very cool to look at. Also, I had totally forgotten about Ice T’s turn as J-Bone, leader of the Lo-Tek underground. It was fun enough, but it was weird to hear the theater audience erupt with applause at the end, though, knowing how it was received almost three decades ago.</p><p>At least some of the movies below, from the last week’s worth of trailers, are bound to be better.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve">A Minecraft Movie</a></h3></p><p>Jack Black’s Steve gets a backstory in the latest <em>Minecraft </em>trailer. The trailer shows young Steve (you can tell he’s young because his beard is brown at first) mining his way into the blocky game world, where he discovers he can build anything he imagines, as long as it’s made with blocks. Plus we get a look at Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen, who all find themselves dropped into this world with a now-much-older Steve (who now has a gray beard to show the passage of time).</p><p>You can catch <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> in theaters on April 4th. Then you can follow it up with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300607/minecraft-theme-park-attractions-merlin-entertainment"><em>Minecraft</em> theme park</a> in 2026 or so. </p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302530/remember-elio-from-pixars-upcoming-film-elio">Elio</a></h3></p><p>The new teaser trailer from Pixar’s <em>Elio</em> lets us know the film is still alive and well. The movie comes from <em>Coco</em> screenwriter Adrian Molina, who co-directs alongside Domee Shi and Madeline Sharafian. It features the voice of Yonas Kibreab as Elio, a child who gets abducted by aliens and pretends to be Earth’s leader. If <em>Coco</em> is any indication, I expect I’ll be openly sobbing at the end. It’s out on June 13th.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301448/hot-xenomorph-summer">Alien: Earth</a></h3></p><p>The FX spinoff <em>Alien: Earth</em> is on its way in summer 2025, when it promises to finally* show us what it might be like to see xenomorphs on our planet. There’s little revealed here apart from the release timeframe and that, as <em>The Verge</em>’s Andrew Webster remarks, the aliens are “still <em>very</em> shiny.”</p><p>*Unless you count the <em>Aliens vs. Predator </em>films.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302318/star-wars-outlaws-lando-dlc-steam-launch-stealth-update">Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card</a></h3></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is getting its first DLC in the form of <em>Wild Card</em>, a storyline that brings Lando Calrissian into the game. If you haven’t been playing the game lately, maybe hopping into a space battle with Han’s old buddy will draw you back in. <em>Wild Card</em> is available now for $14.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300929/the-live-action-remakes-continue-to-drag-on">How to Train Your Dragon</a></h3></p><p>Oh hey, look, a live-action version of an animated movie. <em>How to Train Your Dragon </em>will go head-to-head with <em>Elio</em> when it’s released on June 13th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The follow-up to the similarly incredible Breath of the Wild expanded the open world to stretch above and below Hyrule and introduced brilliant new building and physics systems. With Link's Ultrahand ability, you can manipulate objects and cobble together vehicles, bridges, and other contraptions. Breath of the Wild already offered an impressive degree of freedom, but Tears of the Kingdom takes it a step further. There's no one "right" way to solve the game's many clever puzzles, and that's what makes this sprawling adventure so thoroughly engaging for many dozens, if not hundreds, of hours.</p>

Priced at $250, this will be released on December 20 in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKS9NYZM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox models</a>, and preorders are available now.</p><div title="6527987 - Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO Leverless preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2866" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527987 - Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO Leverless preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO Leverless Fight Stick</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$250 | Releases December 20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While this isn't the first Victrix levelerless fight stick, the Victrix Pro KO is the thinnest and lightest model in the lineup. That said, it doesn't skimp on durability, featuring a high-quality <span>aluminum top plate</span><span> and swappable MX Speed Silver RGB button switches. The stick features 16 main buttons with a layout optimized by fighting game legend Momochi--though all inputs are remappable, and there are four extra button slots if you want to shift the layout.</span></p><p>The Victrix Pro KO comes in two models: A PlayStation version that supports PS5, PS4, and PC, and an Xbox model that works with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Both launch on December 20 for $250--which is comparatively low for premium-level leverless fight sticks. Preorders are available at Amazon.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Leverless fight sticks swap out a joystick for a set of four directional buttons. While it takes some getting used to for those who learned on a traditional fighting stick, leverless models are gaining popularity, as the dedicated directional keys make it easier to perform special moves and combos that require exact button inputs. Some players also find leverless fight sticks to be more comfortable and ergonomic, as there's reduced strain on your wrists when using one.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're interested in a leverless fight stick but don't want to wait for the Victrix Pro KO's December 20 launch date, you could opt for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-FS-12-Arcade-Fight-PlayStation-5/dp/B0B3VP2M12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS-12</a> instead, which is compatible with PC, PS5, and PS4. It has a bulkier design than the Victrix Pro KO and is more expensive at $400, but if you act fast, you can grab one for just $320, thanks to Amazon's Black Friday sale. If you'd prefer something more traditional, there is also a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-FS-12-Arcade-Fight-PlayStation-5/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS</a> model that includes a joystick. Both models are available in white or purple color options.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's the Razer Kitsune for PS5 and PC</a>. This is a premium leverless fight stick, but unlike the bulky Victrix Pro FS models, it features a compact form factor that's easy to slip into a backpack and transport to a fighting game tournament. Normally, the Razer Kitsune costs $300, but you can pick one up at Amazon for just $250 during Black Friday.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Fight Stick Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-FS-12-Arcade-Fight-PlayStation-5/dp/B0B3VP2M12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS-12 (Leverless)</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-FS-12-Arcade-Fight-PlayStation-5/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kitsune</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
