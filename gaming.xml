			<p>During the Future Games Show Spring Showcase, Belgrade-based developer GFA Games debuted a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming STALKER-like MMOFPS Pioner. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> the game multiple times over the years, even featuring it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated multiplayer game list</a>. Despite the delays, the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> confirmed the game's planned 2025 launch on PC, with a console version coming afterward.</p>
<p>Pioner is set in a haunting alternate reality where Soviet-era structures are abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island of more than 50 square kilometers. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, it will run on even modest hardware according to the official minimum and recommended requirements:</p>

<p>The developers of Pioner recently answered some lingering questions from the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be possible to complete the story campaign without going to PvP zones and complete isolated missions without other players.</li>
<li>The game will feature voice and text chat. Global, divided by region, party, or clan.</li>
<li>Some quests can be completed in co-op, but not the entire storyline.</li>
<li>Only cosmetic in-game purchases are planned.</li>
<li>Thanks to the server mirroring system, there won't be any need for custom servers, as players can form a guild that allows them to create a similar enclave on existing servers.</li>
<li>Pioner will support cross-play only on consoles, not with PC, for the sake of balance.</li>
<li>GFA Games plans to release regular updates, including balancing patches, new content, and even major additions that significantly expand the game world.</li>
<li>The game will be available on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>An anti-cheat is being worked on.</li>
<li>There are no plans to switch to Unreal Engine 5 before the game's release. The developers said that UE5 is very demanding on hardware, and they want as many players as possible to enjoy the game.</li>
<li>Pioner will be buy-to-play.</li>
<li>Players won't need to participate in PvP. Story-based activities and activities in which you can get beaten up by other players are separated by both distance and organization.</li>
<li>The left side of the island is dominated by PvE content, while the right side of the island is a PvP area. At the same time, there is only one region in the game where PvP is implemented everywhere - Shadowlands. Only partial areas with PvP rules are implemented in Middle Earth. The team also announced additional rules to avoid the bullying of solo players and respawn camping.</li>
<li>Getting the best equipment will be possible in PvE and PvP activities. The main item you need to have is blueprints and resources. The latter can be obtained in many activities, including PvE. In the world of PIONER, artifacts play a vital role in the economy and the equipment crafting process. Artifacts are expensive and difficult to obtain. The search for artifacts is almost always connected with anomalies, and you can only get an artifact if you have the appropriate equipment.</li>
</ul>

The devs at Remedy talked about their design philosophy behind the <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>-like shooter, answered some questions, and showed off one of the game’s missions. </p><h2 id="h4108104"><a id=""></a>What kind of game is <em>Firebreak</em>?</h2><p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is set in the same universe as <em>Control</em>, which itself is part of the larger “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623?_gl=1*ladiid*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDU1NDYzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623?_gl=1*ladiid*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDU1NDYzLjYwLjAuMA..">Remedy Connected Universe</a></span>” that also includes <em>Alan Wake.</em> Specifically, <em>FBC </em>is set roughly six years after the events of <em>Control</em>. The destructive interdimensional Hiss still infest most of the Oldest House, the impossibly large and cosmic-horror filled HQ of <em>Control’s </em>Federal Bureau of Control. The lockdown is still in place, and after all these years, supplies are running out and people are getting desperate to take back the HQ and kick the Hiss out for good. So the Bureau’s director—<em>Control </em>protagonist Jesse Faden— has ordered the creation of the Firebreak Initiative. This is a volunteer-based emergency response team tasked with stopping the Hiss.</p><p>One of first things that surprised me was Remedy confirming that <em>FBC</em>: <em>Firebreak </em>has no cutscenes. This is part of Remedy’s desire to make <em>FBC </em>pick-up-and-play friendly, one of the game’s core design pillars. The idea is that no matter how many hours you’ve played, you should be able to quickly hop into a game with a buddy and have a good time. </p><p>The other two pillars: Make sure <em>FBC </em>is fun on repeat, and content needs to feel like it could only be found in the wild, strange world of <em>Control</em>. </p><p>During the event, Remedy showed a pre-recorded mission involving three players. Remedy calls these&nbsp;missions “Jobs,” featuring a single main objective with action spread out across a number of sections. Players can control how long and difficult these jobs are before hopping in, which will determine the kinds of rewards and how much XP is awarded at the end</p><p>The job we saw was called Paper Chase and involved three players working together to fight through the Hiss, including battling many enemies seen in<em> Control,</em> while destroying thousands of sticky notes scattered around the Oldest House. The post-it notes can even stick to you and obscure your vision. The combat reminded me of what you might find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everything-is-left-4-dead-now-1847096864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everything-is-left-4-dead-now-1847096864"><em>Left 4 Dead 2 </em>or <em>Back 4 Blood</em></a></span>, or even a mission in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Lots of shooting, managing space, and working together to defeat hordes of baddies or complete smaller sub-objectives.</p><figure id="" data-id="89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-recommend-id="image://89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-recommend-id="image://89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each player takes into battle a special kit that includes different tools that can change things up in a big way. These include turrets, which are just guns taped to office chairs, or a boom box that attracts enemies to it. Like <em>L4D2</em>, players reach big emergency checkpoints throughout the mission and can take a breather and restock. How many of these doors appear in a mission will depend on how hard you made the job. </p><p>Eventually, at the end of the mission, the group took on a giant monster made out of yellow sticky notes. With regards to the key pillars, this certainly seems like something that could only happen in the universe of <em>Control</em>. </p><h2 id="h4108105"><a id=""></a><strong><em>FBC </em>Won’t Feel Like A Second Job</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering why Remedy decided to limit <em>FBC </em>to only three players instead of the more traditional four, the devs explained that they tried out four players early on but it felt like “a little too much to pay attention to” during jobs, and three players “felt better.” You can play solo if you want, or just with one other buddy, but there are no bots. So you’ll need some friends and you’ll need to plan time to play together.</p><p>Getting friends together is tricky for a lot of adults and Remedy seem aware of this. Their goal is to make the game extremely easy to hop into, hence no cutscenes or lengthy tutorials, and to not include any FOMO elements or make <em>FBC </em>feel like a “second job.” You can stop playing <em>FBC </em>for months and then come back and you won’t be behind or need to grind to catch up to friends. <br></p><p>Relatedly, when I asked if <em>FBC </em>had an ending that players could eventually reach, I was told no. The game is meant to be played over and over again, with players unlocking new perks and gear to alter how they play while trying out harder jobs. Interestingly, there also won’t be any major “bespoke” story updates. So it seems the world of <em>FBC </em>will be pretty static compared to some other online games. </p><p>As a big fan of <em>Control</em>, I asked how <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>will impact the already announced and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">currently in development <em>Control 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>For the most part, it won’t. In a later answer given to me via an email after the event, Remedy provided more detail on their thinking. </p><p>“This was a very conscious decision made early on to protect <em>Control </em>players who shouldn’t be made to go outside their genre comfort zone to follow those stories and to protect non-Control players, who shouldn’t feel like they need to go out of their genre comfort zone to understand <em>Firebreak</em>,” said game director Mike Kayatta. Remedy did confirm that <em>FBC </em>is “canon” to <em>Control </em>and hinted that some characters from the game might show up in Firebreak. </p><h2 id="h4108106"><a id=""></a>Is <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>a live-service game?</h2><p>Remedy revealed during the event that <em>FBC </em>will include paid cosmetics and post-launch updates, another fairly big departure from Remedy’s past games. However, they admitted that they were hesitant to use words like “live-service” or “seasons” as these mean very different things to different people. </p><p>They instead explained that they want to respect players’ time. No content in <em>FBC </em>will be “time-restricted” or be based around FOMO. Remedy insists they are working hard to make a game “for people with kids,” aka gamers with limited time. They also confirmed that all playable content updates will be free and promised more specific details closer to launch.</p><p>When I asked if <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will have a battle pass or not, the answer was fairly vague. I asked for some clarification and received this response:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re not going to have any time-restricted content delivery mechanisms. We’ll be revealing more about our post launch a bit later, but ultimately we can confirm that none of this content will be released on limited time rotation. We want to ensure that whether you play daily or play every other week, you’ll have the opportunity to acquire all the same items.</p></blockquote><figure id="" data-id="47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-recommend-id="image://47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-recommend-id="image://47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I asked how <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will compete with other online shooters and co-op games, Remedy pushed back and said they weren’t competing with those kinds of games. Instead they want <em>FBC </em>to “slot in” to your life between other games that might demand more of your time. <em>FBC </em>can be a thing you come back to whenever you want and have some free time. Once again, the devs brought up the goal of not making <em>FBC </em>feel like a second job.</p><p>Finally, I asked about Switch 2. Remedy made a point during the presentation to talk about how they are striving to make <em>FBC </em>Steam Deck verified and want it to run well on lower spec PCs. So I wondered if that meant a Switch 2 port was in the works. </p><p>“We are very busy in developing the game for the launch,” said Kayatta. “So we haven’t given the Switch 2 any thought at this point, but things can always change in the future.” Well, I tried. </p><p>For now, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will launch later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remedy-firebreak-shooter-flop-plan-co-op-game-pass-ps5-1851736526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-firebreak-shooter-flop-plan-co-op-game-pass-ps5-1851736526">It will launch day one on both Game Pass and PS Plus</a></span>, another way Remedy is trying to give <em>FBC</em> the best shot at finding an audience and avoiding the fate of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*kid9cz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTkwMzE3LjQ5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*kid9cz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTkwMzE3LjQ5LjAuMA..">Sony’s failed FPS <em>Concord</em></a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/frosthavens-weighty-tabletop-tactics-are-coming-to-pc-in-early-access-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>I can say this for certain: The game's tutorial does a lot of work in introducing you to the game's core mechanics, which include choosing cards with sequential actions, "burning" cards for temporary boosts, positioning, teamwork, and having enough actions or options left if a fight goes longer than you think. I'm not a total newcomer to the <em>-haven</em> games, having played a couple rounds of the <em>Gloomhaven&nbsp;</em>board game. But none of my friends, however patient, did as good a job of showing just how important it was to consider not just attack, defend, or move, but where each choice would place you, and how it would play with your teammates.</p>
<p>I played as a "Banner Spear," one of the six starting classes. Their thing is—you guessed it—having a spear, and they can throw it or lunge with it from farther away. Many of the Banner Spear's cards are more effective with positioning, like pincer-flanking an enemy or attacking from off to the side of your more up-close melee teammate. With only two players taking on a couple of enemies, I verbally brushed off the idea of using some more advanced options. My developer partner, using a Deathwalker, interjected: "Ah, but that is what summons are for."</p>
<p>Soon enough, one of the brutes was facing down two skeletons, and I was able to get a nice shot in from an adjacent hex. The next thing I wanted to do was try out being a little selfish, running for some loot left behind by a vanquished goon. I forgot that you only pick up loot if you end your turn on a hex, not just pass through it, so my Banner Spear appeared to go on a little warm-up jog, for no real reason, before re-engaging the Germinate we were facing.</p>
<p>The art, animations, and feel of everything I clicked on was engaging, even as the developers regularly reassured me that all of it needs working on. With many more experienced players kicking the tires in early access, I expect the systems and quality-of-life details to see even more refinement. It's a long campaign, both for players and the developers, but there's a good chance it will be worth it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Remedy is a studio known for disappearing into its work for several years, then emerging with an inventive, often mind-bending, single-player game such as Max Payne, Alan Wake, or Control. But the studio has grown a lot lately, becoming a team juggling several projects simultaneously. Alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/" data-ref-id="5000-562243">Max Payne remakes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control-2/" data-ref-id="5000-575910">Control 2</a>, Remedy is also trying something very different from its past games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC Firebreak</a> is a three-player co-op PvE first-person shooter set in The Oldest House, the setting for Control. I recently got to see a hands-off preview of the game, which strives to combine the team's signature strangeness with the pick-up-and-play appeal of a modern multiplayer shooter. But its best feat may be what it <em>doesn't </em>want to be: your part-time job.</p><p dir="ltr">In FBC Firebreak, teams of three players go on missions called Jobs, in which they have to cleanse various sections of the unpredictable Oldest House, fighting The Hiss with an array of weapons that feels decidedly Remedy-like. Control's wide variety of Hiss enemies was on exciting display in the mission I saw, called Paper Chase, in which FBC first responders had to make it through hordes of corrupted agents using weapons like a piggy-bank mallet, all before fighting a gigantic boss monster that had formed from millions of sticky notes, like a chaotic blend of Office Space and Ghostbusters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461923" data-ratio="0.55927835051546" data-width="1940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461923"></a><figcaption>FBC Firebreak leans into some classic co-op mechanics, such as complementary player builds, but it leans into Remedy's weirdness, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo I saw showed off several "Kits," each of them meant to lean into a type of play and collectively complement each other in a three-person squad. The Jump Kit uses electricity abilities and offers buffs to mobility; the Fix Kit is a tanky offering with a huge wrench for melee attacks; the Splash Kit is designed as a support class that can disrupt the environment using a water-based loadout.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game can be played solo or in pairs, Remedy said it's designed for the full team of three to take on hordes of Hiss. As each Job comprises three zones with different objectives, environments, and challenges presented each time you play, and with each zone escalating in difficulty and culminating in a boss showdown, players short on allies will have their hands full, but it's doable.</p><p dir="ltr">The visual flair, inventive weapons, intense combat, and sly workplace humor shading it all were very reminiscent of Control, but because of the first-person perspective and the game's endlessly replayable mission format, it also reminded me of Left 4 Dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Game director Mike Kayetta told me that although the team looked to other modern shooters for guidance on bringing FBC Firebreak to life, much is owed to that co-op all-timer, too. "Of course, there is no (and should be no) perfect comparison to another game out there [...] especially, the greats like L4D. It's the crowned granddaddy of the whole co-op session thing, and yes, there's been a lot of evolution and movement in games since then, but I don't think anyone could jump into this space without some healthy respect and awe for the original king."</p><p dir="ltr">One thing I learned in writing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">retrospective on Left 4 Dead</a> is how its total lack of a metagame--no battle passes, no leveling system, no endless train of unlockables--is considered by some developers to be a non-starter today. You just can't really build a game like that anymore, a few developers suggested when I spoke to them for that story. FBC Firebreak doesn't go as far as L4D in throwing out <em>all </em>of those elements; you do level up, and there are loadouts to perfect and rewards to unlock, but a major distinction between this game and most others in the multiplayer space today is that it doesn't punish you for not playing on its schedule. Refreshingly, it has no plans to be a live-service game in that sense.</p><p dir="ltr">"Most of that decision came from just being gamers and listening to gamers," Kayetta told me. "So many people are feeling the same thing. There's already too much good stuff out there for me to get through my backlog, and now you want me to play <em>only </em>this game? Or feel too bad because I didn't play this game <em>enough</em>? Maybe I'm just grumpy because I have two kids at home and precious little time to play, but I know I can't be the only one."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461924" data-ratio="0.55975168132437" data-width="1933" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461924"></a><figcaption>The game's story is set six years after the events of Control, and many have made The Oldest House their home.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, I also have two kids at home and have lamented how games ask for my undivided attention to the extent that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-reached-peak-battle-pass-and-i-can-no-longer-keep-up-with-my-favorite-games/1100-6508089/">I sometimes stop playing games I enjoy</a> just because I feel like I'm not able to min-max their metagames properly. Kayetta's words were all too familiar to me, as I'm sure they are to many others reading this now. This feeling was so common within Remedy that the game director told me he couldn't even recall a time when anyone pushed back against the idea and vouched for making the game more of a traditional live service. "No second-guessing. Really, I am sitting here racking my brain for a single example of someone who wanted to do something different and drawing a blank," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say FBC Firebreak will be without post-launch support. The game will get free updates such as new missions, and paid cosmetics will be available to engage the community that's playing the game a lot anyway, but if you're among such devotees, it ought to be because you want to be there, not because you feel obligated to show up. There will be "no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins," Remedy said.</p><p dir="ltr">The line between post-launch support and a live-service game is blurry, Kayetta said, "because different people have different takes on what [live service] means. What we do on Firebreak has never been about trying to conform to or buck those trends. We just talked about what was going to provide value to the people who give our game a shot and join the community we're trying to build. And what was reasonable to ask of them in return. This is where we landed."</p><p dir="ltr">It's almost nostalgic to hear a team speak this way about a multiplayer game. It made me think of how many hours I poured into L4D--literally thousands, I'd estimate--and how I did that all without concern for any of the FOMO-inducing metagame systems that now similarly keep me engaged with games I do genuinely enjoy but sometimes play merely to check their proverbial boxes. Some live-service games have opted to offer battle passes that don't expire as a solution, but this hardly helps since newer battle passes are always available too. I've even found this system to be worse sometimes, like when I jumped back into Halo Infinite and found I had about nine earlier passes to work on if I cared to catch up to present-day offerings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461965" data-ratio="0.56043388429752" data-width="1936" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461965"></a><figcaption>Strange weapons, an abundance of enemy types, and ever-shifting mission objectives are meant to keep the game full of surprises.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To the extent FBC Firebreak has progression systems, I expect I'll be heavily inspired to max them out anyway. I tend to enjoy Remedy's work, the gameplay demo I saw looked excellent, and I'll no doubt be scrubbing its levels for more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/">Remedy Connected Universe</a> teases to dissect in any case. But it's heartening to know I'll be doing all these things because I want to, not because they're some unseen boss's orders.</p><p dir="ltr">FBC Firebreak is coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 this summer. It'll be a "mid-priced title" and, in a rare move, it will launch into both Xbox Game Pass <em>and </em>PlayStation Plus on day one.</p>

Based on the popular board game and in production at Snapshot Games, development on the project is being led by CEO and X-COM creator Julian Gollop. Isaac Childres--who designed the Frosthaven board game--is also involved with the adaptation and fans can check out a closed beta playtest for Frosthaven starting March 27 and running through April 24. This will feature six starting character classes and 20 quests to try out.</p><p>"We're very excited to bring Frosthaven into the digital realm," Gollop said in a press release. "With this video game adaptation of Frosthaven, all of us at Snapshot Games know just how beloved the board game is and have been taking great care of replicating the board game experience as much as possible. We feel that fans of the board game, both newcomers and long-time veterans, will find that the video game we're working on is not only a faithful adaptation but also another way to play their favorite board game in a more accessible way to help introduce their friends to the game."</p><p>If you've never played it, Frosthaven is a spiritual successor to the board game Gloomhaven. One of the most successful board games to be crowdfunded through Kickstarter, the core focus of Frosthaven is on carefully managing resources, coming up with powerful synergies between character classes, and exploring a world of grim fantasy. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Games says that players will need to balance risk and reward as they explore the deep mechanics and challenging scenarios of Frosthaven, and while it doesn't have a firm release date yet, it will be released on PC eventually. Other elements that Snapshot is working on for Frosthaven include building and managing your own outpost, tactical turn-based combat, and co-op multiplayer for up to four players.</p>

Combat is best avoided, as just one or two undead monsters can kill playable characters, especially if they're already injured, sick, or tired.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days lets you build out a base, but demands you defend or even ditch it when it's time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p>Like State of Decay, the game features permadeath, so there are no do-overs and killing off your entire community will spell game over.

            <p>FBC: Firebreak - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">Remedy's three-player co-op first person shooter</a> based within Control's Oldest House - is set to release this summer, and now the team has given us a fresh look at the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In FBC: Firebreak, players will take on the role of volunteer first responders, who are doing what they can to help sort out the Hiss that remain within the building - essentially, what happens when the Federal Bureau of Control actually loses control?</p>
<p>The studio shared a new trailer for FBC: Firebreak as part of this evening's Future Game Show presentation, giving us a look at how volatile office stationary can really be! I am talking about lacerating post-it note people - it's chaos!</p>

<p>These post-it note entities are part of FBC: Firebreak's aptly-titled "Paper Chase" job. Jobs are this game's version of missions, with each job being a "wrapper for a unique crisis" within the Oldest House, so if you have played Control, you will recognise locations.</p>
<p>In the case of FBC: Firebreak's Paper Chase job, it's set in the bureau's Executive Sector. "And, just like real world crises, like fires and floods, these things have a way of coming back - your work is important, but never ends," adds game director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p>As to how FBC: Firebreak will all work, once players have selected a job to take on, they will then select a Threat level - that is to say, decide on the combat difficulty, as well as how many rewards players can earn - as well as a Clearance level. The Clearance Level determines the number of zones players can make their way through, as well as what type of rewards they can earn.</p>
<p>Then, there are FBC: Firebreak's loadouts, or to give them their Remedy name, Crisis Kits. These kits are each centred around a unique tool, and FBC: Firebreak players will have three saved kits to choose from: Jump Kit, Fix Kit and Splash Kit.</p>
<p>The Jump Kit is an electricity-focused Crisis Kit, complete with an Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor. The Fix Kit comes with a chunky wrench (or, spanner for those of us in Blighty), while the Splash Kit is a water-focused kit with a Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are already thinking about FBC: Firebreak's post launch content, well Remedy is on it. The game itself will be a premium mid-price release on its debut, but any playable post-launch content will be free for all owners. There will also be some cosmetic items players can spend some additional money on, if they so choose.</p>

<p>The team at Remedy is, understandably, aware it is about to release a multiplayer shooter into the world during a period when multiplayer shooters are having a hard time standing out - but even so, it says it isn't nervous.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A about FBC: Firebreak attended by Eurogamer, the developer said it wasn't concerned about the game finding its niche. "It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy spokesperson Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."</p>
<p>Puha continued: "There are reasons why we [Remedy] have managed to survive for 30 years in this industry, which is so volatile. It's managing risks, which means 'let's be careful with the budget and make a game in a sensible budget and time frame'. But also, we are not naive. It's our first multiplayer game, so we are doing everything in our power to make sure things launch well."</p>
<p>Puha added Remedy intends to support FBC: Firebreak for "the longhaul", and the studio has "very concrete plans" on what the post-launch content should look like. "Let's get it out first, and we will take it from there," Puha said.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will be making its debut this summer (a more specific date is TBA) across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC, as well as on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/into-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PikPok has announced the release date for zombie shelter survival game&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>, the latest entry in the developer's&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>series and the first one to land on PC.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Future Games Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 9th. PikPok says it's intending the game to remain in Early Access for "at least a year", but that timeline "may shift".</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>games were released on mobile devices (and Switch), but&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>represents the franchise's first foray into the land of PC. It's also getting a native Mac port.</p>

<p>From your shelter (which can, of course, be upgraded), you'll sally forth into the city of Walton to scavenge for supplies and help your camp to survive. Of course, along the way, you'll have to deal with the undead.</p>

<p>PikPok describes&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>' world as "dynamic and challenging"; you'll be faced with decisions like whether to recruit allies or leave people to fend for themselves, how to manage your camp's "physical and psychological needs", and more.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the developer says that entire parts of the town "may become overrun and completely uninhabitable" as you play, necessitating a shelter move or perhaps even abandonment. It's all down to you.</p>




<p>You may be a little worried about&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>if you can remember the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players" rel="nofollow">last zombie survival game</a> that tried to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media" rel="nofollow">make a name for itself</a> on Steam, but this one looks like it's much more reasonably scoped, so hopefully, we won't get a repeat of that debacle.</p>

<p><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 9th.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</a>, is coming up to three years now, but at the Future Games Show this evening, all these years on, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> announced that the strategy action game will be getting its first bit of DLC, War Sails. If you can't gather from the name, featured image above, and trailer below, the DLC is all about boats; sailing 'em, fighting with 'em, trading with 'em, you name it, these boats can do it (within reason).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
War Sails quite notably is introducing a Viking-inspired faction, where you can do your usual thing of deciding to trade, recruit, or fight them (once you've made your way to the Northern Kingdom anyway). Based on details from a press release, sailing won't be as easy as 1, 2, 3 as you'll have wind and water physics to deal with. 
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA0YoFBX60M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
But one thing that does sound neat, and you can catch a glimpse of in the trailer above, is that you'll be able to ram into and board enemy ships, as well as destroy their oars and tear their sails. Sounds like a slightly more in-depth take on what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has going on, and I'm quite fond of that game.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will have 18 ships to choose from, all of which handle differently and can be upgraded, and you'll be able to unlock more banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armour, that sort of thing. You've not long to wait either, as it's set to be released this coming June 17th.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, more free updates are planned too that'll bring in some new mechanics like a stealth and disguise system, a Parley feature, and general combat improvements. Best keep your eyes peeled for that one.

            <p>Frosthaven - the sequel to Cephalofair's knock-a-horse-out massive board game - is getting a digital version from Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games. You can <a href="http://playfrosthaven.com/">sign up here</a> to its closed beta kicking off March 27th, and it's coming to Steam early access later this year.</p>
<p>Like predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>, Frosthaven is a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you'll resolve story events and encounters between dungeon delving, retiring old characters and unlocking new classes as you progress. New to Frosthaven is a fleshed-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> that has you build up and  protect an outpost, while dealing with harsh seasons and invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I really <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">enjoyed Gloomhaven digital</a>, mostly for not getting in the tabletop game's way to much, but also for not requiring glue to put third party token trays together. Core to the game is tactical card combat where everything from movement to spellcasting is dictated by your hand. You pick two cards a turn from a deck you customise as you progress, and select actions from the top of one card and the bottom of the other. Each card also has an initiative value, so you're constantly assessing threats to see if you can pull off slower moves, or even whether you're better off sacrificing advanced plays altogether and opting for the generic attack or move option each card offers.</p>
<p>You can get old cards back by resting, but this means burning others. It's all crunchier than a Crunchy bar dredged in grit then left out to dry under an alien sun that emanates ultra-crunchy crunch rays, but  also full of character and a bit of roleplaying.</p>
<p>Designer Isaac Childres has consulted on the digital version throughout development, and Snapshot say they've spent a lot of time getting the feel of the world right in motion. In a preview session I attended recently, Director Hristo Petkov gave me the example of the Snowdancer. She's a bestial, graceful hero character whose dance-like fighting style the team had originally animated as similar to Capoeira - before Childres told them he'd imagined it closer to ballet. There's an entire environment named the Metallic Ruins in the digital version that only exists as prose in the board game, and they've worked closely with Childres to bring it to life here.</p>
<p>They're keen to highlight a more robust tutorial this time, too - also designed by Childres - alongside some more granular difficulty selections, including ones that prevent you getting exhausted and failing. The early access version has 35 quests across the first two acts of the game, with the full game planned to have over 130. There's also 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. I'm excited! I never ended up buying Frosthaven, since I'd also need to start sleeping on the box to justify the space investment, so this suits me just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, the fantasy strategy RPG famed for its endlessly enjoyable medieval combat, is taking to the high seas in its next expansion, War Sails. The upcoming naval expansion was announced during the Future Games Show Spring Showcase.</p>







<p>War Sails will introduce naval combat to Mount and Blade for the first time in the franchise’s history. Taking much inspiration from the Vikings, players will command 18 types of ship, engage enemy ships in naval combat, and build an empire on the seas. The trailer showed large-scale naval battles and the ability to command a massive fleet and board enemy ships. Just like with their armies on land, players will need to upgrade and manage their fleet, and keep supplies stocked to prevent poor performance or even a mutiny.</p>



<p>In the Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord base game, players grow their parties from a small band of soldiers into a powerful army capable of taking any stronghold by force. Over time, players outfit their army with siege engines and cavalry. The roleplaying elements come into play when players manage relationships with various NPC like local lords, merchants, and brigands. There are eight major factions, each consisting of its own set of clans, beliefs, goals, and outlier groups. In the trailer for War Sails, the various color schemes of the different factions can be seen on the soldiers and the ship dressing. A ninth faction, the Nords of the Northern Kingdom, will debut in War Sails. New features like a robust stealth system and random events will be added to the base game as well.</p>

<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered is all set to arrive on PC next month, April 3, and to celebrate the occasion, they are introducing new No Return Content as a free PS5 update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s new No Return content will be available on PC at launch and on PS5 on the same date as the free downloadable 2.0.0 patch. This update will introduce four new maps, two new characters, new trophies and additional bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-tlou-2-no-return">What’s New in TLOU 2 No Return?</h2>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s No Return mode’s first new map is Overlook, which provides a view of the city of Seattle. Next is School, where players might remember facing W.L.F with Ellie and Dina. The third map, Streets, is set in Hillcrest’s overgrown neighbourhood. Last is Nest, the infected-infested building players had to clear as Abby in The Last of Us Part 2.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Last of Us 2 will add Bill and Marlene as the two new characters for No Return in the latest PS5 update. Bill features the ‘Smuggler’ playstyle, has access to the custom pump shotgun, receives double rewards from drops, and can fend for himself against melee attacks but cannot dodge. Marlene, on the other hand, has the ‘Risk Taker’ play style, which provides her with a Custom Assault Rifle, ‘All or Nothing Gambits’, and has the ability to reroute her No Return Path once per run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-2-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-jacket">The Last of Us 2 Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Jacket</h2>



<p>Moreover, Naughty Dog is offering some cosmetic content for The Last of Us 2 along with the No Return content; it will be available on PC and PS5 for free. It is a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from their upcoming game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Players will have to unlock the skin via in-game bonus points.</p>

            <p>
You know, with there being so many games set in ancient Rome, most of them being strategy games, I'm not sure I've ever seen a pixel art game with that setting. I bring this up because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a>, a pixel art game with that exact setting, just got announced at the Future Games Show. From the offset it looks a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>, and according to the publisher behind it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/three-friends">Three Friends</a> themselves, the latter is in fact a source of inspiration, alongside SNES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Described as a survival town-builder, Romestead lets you rebuild civilisation from ruin as a Roman leader (which as a concept considering publisher Three Friends is made up of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> devs). That involves things like putting your people to work by farming crops, smithing weapons, rounding up resources, all things you appear to be able to do yourself too, so I imagine you can't be tyrant right from the get go, as was typical of many Romans back in the day.
</p>
<p>
There's a worship system where you can pray to a bunch of Roman gods to unlock various buildings, upgrades, technologies, all of which I find amusing very conceptually. "You have prayed enough to me so I give you the gift of a slightly bigger house" is how I imagine to play out, which tickles me in a "aren't video games so quaint?" kind of way.
</p>
<p>
That Zelda element comes in through dungeons that you can explore and bosses you can face off against, and a big ole world to explore too. And to boot you don't have to do it alone as there's multiplayer co-op too.
</p>
<p>
Romestead doesn't currently have a release date, but it is planned for an early access release. If this all takes your fancy, then you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805320">here</a>.
