			<p>A new Unreal Engine 5 feature pushed to the engine's main development branch last week could pave the way for significant Lumen performance improvements across the board and for the lighting technology to be implemented in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://x.com/DylserX"> tech artist Dylan Browne on X</a>, Lumen Irradiance Cache, a probe-based Lumen mode for lower-end devices, is now available in the Epic engine. Compared to the default Hardware Lumen, the new mode features less occlusion detail and worse reflections, but it's still a good compromise compared to having no Lumen at all, judging from the comparison video below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lumen Irradiance Cache | New Probe Based Lumen For Lower End | Unreal Engine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkLmUPJvhsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As the Unreal Engine 5 Lumen Irradiance Cache is still in a very early state, it is difficult to say how much low-power devices will benefit from it. However, things are looking quite promising already. According to a now-removed GitHub commit, which was captured before removal and shared on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-ps5-power-saver-mode-tested-a-green-initiative-next-gen-handheld-teaser-or-both.1335199/#post-146877265">ResetERA forums</a>, Lumen Radiance Cache speeds up the Lumen gather stage by 2.5 times for an overall Lumen Scene speedup of 1.5.</p>



<p>This lighter version of Lumen could finally make Unreal Engine 5’s signature lighting viable on lower-power hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, even if in a limited form. At this time, games powered by the engine released on the new generation Nintendo console, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, don't feature Lumen, most likely because <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/">the console's CPU&nbsp;can't run games with such demanding features at an acceptable performance level.</a></p>



<p>As even Fortnite doesn't run with Lumen and Nanite on the Nintendo Switch 2, it's clear that dedicated work had to be made on the engine for the console to support these hallmark features, which seems to be already happening with the implementation of this new Lumen option. Hopefully, it won't take long for developers to take advantage of it and bring Switch 2 ports closer to the other console versions in terms of visual fidelity.</p>

            <p>Co-operative starship mishap sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-space">Jump Space</a> just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/543372164837935536">the first major update</a> of its early access phase, bringing both functional capitalism and a surprisingly enjoyable trio of melee weapons. The former takes the shape of newly opened item shops at your home base, giving you a chance to stock up on guns, repair kits, or artifact buffs before shipping out on a mission. And, having thwacked a few bots with the latter, I’m liking how worthy they are of a precious weapon slot, even in a game previously set up entirely for gunplay.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Besides their generous impact damage, the newly added wrench, crowbar, and sci-fi Heatblade sword can – with a timely block – deflect laser blasts back at the mechanoid dickhead who fired them. Yes, Jump Space now has parrying, which I’m aware in 2025 is the action game equivalent of saying <em>wow, this strategy game’s got deckbuilding in it</em>. But I still think these three hittin' sticks are good additions, for two reasons: one, they add a needed extra dimension to Jump Space’s otherwise simplistic shooting, and two, it’s simply a right old laugh to perform laser-bouncing ninja nonsense with what is outwardly a completely mundane pipe wrench.</p>
<p>Basically: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crsO5CO3KTA">Oh, good. Why that’s very good. Yes, I like that.</a></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Keepsake Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shops aren’t as interesting, though I imagine the ability to quickly tool back up with basic guns might take some sting out of losing your upgraded arsenal in a failed run. Speaking of which, the patch notes also share some of Keepsake Games' thinking on equipment permanence: in short, it doesn’t sound like they’re adding the (apparently much-requested) option to stash favourite guns for safekeeping, though the plan is to make higher-tier loot spawns more common. "This will make good weapons frequent enough that hugging your MK3 for dear life won't be players’ top priority," the post explains.</p><p>Back in the present, this update also adds a handful of mission modifiers, potentially throwing in yet more baddie spaceships to dogfight or extra salvaging opportunities, as well as a little Hallowe'en event involving the fetch-questing of pumpkins. Your reward? Another pumpkin, specifically one to wear on your head. It presumably still protects you against the vacuum of space, unlike the ones they have in Tesco.</p>
<p>Jump Space still has a lot of early access jumping to do. Nothing here fixes its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spark-of-co-op-magic-keeps-jump-space-flying-though-early-access-turbulence">biggest issue of mission and environment repetition</a>, which will need solving if it’s to have real legs. This patch feels like a pretty good enough start, though.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/costco%E2%80%99s-1-year-membership-now-comes-with-a-digital-shop-card-that-almost-covers-the-cost-making-it-basically-free.1336000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you get invited to an exclusive event, usually you’re the one who’s expected to come bearing gifts. But with Costco’s invitation to join their Gold Star club for just $65, which gets you a year of access to incredible savings across all of their huge array of departments, you’re the one receiving the gift in the form of a $40 gift card. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">The invitation is waiting for you now at StackSocial.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If your one-stop shopping ambitions are even greater, so are the rewards. <strong>StackSocial is offering a year’s membership to Costco’s Executive Gold Star club, where you get all of the access and benefits of Gold Star membership plus a 2% annual reward on all of your purchases, for just $130</strong>. That one comes with a $60 gift card, so you get nearly half of your membership fee back instantly.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5026/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Costco Executive Gold Star at Stacksocial</a></p>

<h2>Members Only</h2>
<p>A membership is the only way to get in the door at any of Costco’s 635 locations nationwide, but when the membership fee is marked down so significantly and delivered with a gift card to be used on your first shopping trip, it’s more than worth it. Whether you go in person or shop online, Costco is the ultimate in one-stop shopping, with everything from fresh groceries, meat, and fish to clothes for men, women, and kids, with literally hundreds of other goods and services in between.</p>
<p>A trip to Costco can replace your trips to the grocery store, big-box electronics store, hardware store, bakery, liquor store, drugstore, and more. Then, of course, there is the legendary Costco food court, where the $1.50 all-beef hot dog and 20 oz drink deal has not changed price in years. And before you gas up the car for your Costco trip, remember that Costco membership also gets you access to the dramatically reduced gas prices at Costco’s own pumps.</p>



<h2>More Than Merchandise</h2>
<p>Costco’s deals on merchandise and groceries are amazing, but so are their deals on services you wouldn’t normally associate with a shopping run. Costco’s automotive department has outstanding deals on tires and other services that are performed on-site, and there are also optometry and prescription departments ready to provide important personal health services at lower prices. Travel deals, check printing, free roadside assistance, auto insurance, water delivery — it’s no exaggeration to say that Costco has virtually any and everything you can think of.</p>
<p>But the only way to get in on all of these goods and services at fantastic prices is by having a membership. StackSocial’s deals for new members on a year of Gold Star membership for $65 or a year of Executive Gold Star membership for $130 await, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5025/">as do the $40 (Gold Star) or $65 (Executive Gold Star) gift cards that automatically recoup much your first year’s fee.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last time that the Department of Homeland Security used a video game property to try and recruit people to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/portland-frog-costume-ice-facility-protest-oregon-trump-2000634001"><span>ICE</span></a><span>, it was with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> video</span></a><span> in which they said they were going to “catch” undocumented people while the original anime’s theme song played over footage of ICE agents invading homes and arresting people. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>The Pokémon Company didn’t do anything about it</span></a><span>, so I guess whoever’s on the DHS’ social accounts is feeling brave enough to keep using video game imagery to try and promote ICE and recruit people to its cause, because it’s now using </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>imagery and language days after Halo Studios </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><span>announced the original game is being remade and ported to PlayStation</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The post on the DHS’ X account has an image of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> characters on a Warthog with the subtitle “Finishing this fight,” a reference to the line from </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> in which protagonist Master Chief says he’s “finishing this fight” with the Covenant by blowing up their ship at the end of the sequel. The image itself has the text “Destroy the Flood,” which refers to a parasitic alien species that Master Chief and his friends fight throughout the series, just above a link to the ICE recruitment website. The rhetoric is not subtle.</span></p>

 <p><span>The replies are full of the same memetic bullshit you often see on such posts that shows some people view uprooting other people’s lives (or worse) as something to cheer for and encourage the way you might celebrate a sports team’s championship win.

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have just revealed that Battlefield Redsec - the game's free-to-play Battle Royale mode - will be available tomorrow on the 28th October.</p>
<p>This announcement came out of nowhere, with a post made across official Battlefield social media accounts. This announcement came alongside a scheduled YouTube launch trailer reveal for Redsec, which will go live at 2PM BST / 3PM CST / 10AM EST / 7AM PST.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-battlefield-redsec-could-shadowdrop-as-soon-as-next-week-dataminers-claim">The sudden news comes soon after dataminers claimed last weekend that the battle royale mode could be imminently dropped</a>. It seems the general audience will have little lead up to the battle royale mode, and instead will have to experience the whole thing fresh together starting tomorrow. Certainly a bold way to drum up excitement around a much-anticipated game mode.</p>

<p>EA has yet to state officially what will be in the Redsec Battle Royale mode, how large the map will be, or the finer details on how it'll play compared to some of its major competitors. However, leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">did peel back the curtain on this battle royale mode several months </a><a href="http://ago.it/">ago.</a> It is of course worth noting that time has passed since this testing period, and leaked details may have changed significantly during that time.</p><p>This shadow drop comes while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> continues its streak of popularity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">One of the best performing Battlefield's ever</a> so far, the game recently gave players a look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-has-its-season-one-trailer-showing-new-weapons-maps-and-a-tactical-game-mode">upcoming Season One update</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">a massive update that'll fix one of the game's biggest ongoing problems</a>.</p>

		<p>Two Point Studios has announced that the next DLC for Two Point Museum will give players a new wildlife wing with Zooseum. Zooseum is less about putting animals on as exhibits but more on rescuing them, raising them, healing their issues, and working to rewild them. Much like what many modern zoos do. That also makes one wonder if this is a possible glimpse of a future Two Point Zoo game.</p>

<p>Aside from the short teaser trailer, there has been no further details about Two Point Museum’s Zooseum. Content and a release date will be announced later on, though a specific timeframe has not been given. Two Point Museum is launching on Nintendo Switch 2 tomorrow, and handily we have a review of it.</p>

<p>In our review, Stefan said, <em>“Two Point Museum on Switch 2 is a fairly straightforward port to Nintendo’s latest console. The minor glitches and crashes should be ironed out quickly, but it’s clear that the game simulation does hit the limits of the Switch 2’s CPU and larger museums do drop the frame rate. Still, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable and endlessly quirky management sim that’s an easy recommendation for fans of the genre and this series in particular. If you can’t accept a few compromises, the other platforms are ready and waiting.”</em></p>

In fact, it has put up the US' biggest physical game launch in over two years.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.circana.com/gb">Circana</a>'s Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">Bluesky</a>, who noted that the US hasn't seen a launch like Z-A's since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> arrived back on the scene in May 2023.</p>
<p>We should note that the data only accounts for "physical unit and dollar sales" and <em>not</em> digital or bundle purchases, but nonetheless, standing up there with TOTK — one of the most-anticipated games in recent memory — isn't bad going.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yotvwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there might be a bit of you thinking "well, duh, it's Pokémon, <em>obviously</em> it sold well," and you'd be right... for the most part. As we alluded to earlier, Z-A's release numbers are far from what the series has mustered in the past. In Europe, the game's racked up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">smallest retail launch for a mainline game</a> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Let's Go! Pikachu and Let's Go! Eevee</a>, and while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/japanese-charts-surprise-surprise-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust">Japanese numbers</a> are impressive, it's <em>far</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>'s debut.</p>
<p>All this is to say, even a quieter Pokémon launch is still a rather big deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Had ‘Massive’ Retail Launch in the US, Biggest Since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-had-%E2%80%98massive%E2%80%99-retail-launch-in-the-us-biggest-since-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.1335964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last Friday, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the latest entry in the ever-popular monster catching franchise, had sold 5.8 million copies in its debut week.</p>



<p>Now, Circana's Senior Director &amp; Video Game Industry Thought Leader, Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's retail launch was particularly big in the United States, where it registered the best performance of the last two and a half years.</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A had a massive US launch at retail. Launch week physical unit and dollar sales of Pokémon Legends: Z-A were the biggest for a new physical video game launch since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in May of 2023.</em></p>



<p>It's not at all surprising that Nintendo games excel at retail sales performance. PlayStation and Xbox users have long since switched to digital games, but the Nintendo audience is different and still quite linked to physical units.</p>



<p>In Europe, though, the retail launch was a bit smaller. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Game Business</a>, which had access to GSD data, Pokémon Legends: Z-A managed to knock EA's Battlefield 6 from the top position but also registered a 28% sales drop compared to the debut week of Pokémon Legends: Arceus in 2022. Indeed, as noted back when the official sales announcement was shared last week, Arceus had sold 6.5 million units in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Still, the game appears to have received the acclaim of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch wrote:</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s battle royale mode has a name, and it isn’t quite as awful as I was expecting, falling well short of the exhilarating cringe of "Battlefortnite". Battlefield REDSEC, they’re calling it. Such a Tom Clancelled, Limp Bizkit-ass moniker. What does REDSEC stand for, EA? Rampant Ennui Detected, Send Emergency Cookies? Or is it a game about hunting down commie office assistants? See, this is why they pay me the big bananas here at Rock Paper Shitpun Dot Com.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The more momentous news here is that REDSEC will be free-to-play. This implies that it will exist as a standalone experience, like Call Of Duty: Warzone – an endlessly contracting and expanding skirmish that floats alongside the numbered sequels. It won’t just be an update for Battlefield 6 itself, which explains why it’s absent from the latter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">Season 1 DLC plans</a>. Still, I’m getting ahead of myself.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing else to share right now, beyond pointing you toward EA’s placeholder for the full gameplay trailer tomorrow. It seems likely the publishers’ hands have been forced by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online">rumours this weekend</a> - the people who outed it as REDSEC also claim that it'll launch on 28th October.</p>

<p>Last week, dataminers also discovered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/either-battlefield-6s-battle-royale-mode-will-release-next-week-or-theyre-adding-granite-or-something-called-granite">a mysterious piece of forthcoming content called “Granite”</a> on the EA app, rumoured to be the new Battlefield's battle royale functionality. I am defiantly clinging to the hope that this is a literal addition to the game's building materials that will absolutely ruin the lives of tank drivers.
</p><p>
All this comes as EA make tweaks to Battlefield 6’s progression system, handling and arsenal – recent measures include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">cracking down on attempts</a> to farm the bots in custom modes for easy XP. In hindsight, I wonder how much of that tweaking was carried out with a view to preparing the ground for REDSEC – even if the latter can be played separately, there will surely be a lot of crossover with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer component. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the game takes heavy inspiration from Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, EA’s flagship battle royale – the current head of Battlefield Studios is Vince Zampella, Respawn co-founder.
</p>
<p>
Again, I’m speculating. And why should I speculate, when some of you lurking bastards have been playing REDSEC in playtests? I know because you keep popping up in the comments on Battlefield 6 articles to waggle your eyebrows and hum innocently. Come on, break your NDA. I won't tell anyone. Nobody from EA reads this site anyway. There's a nice banana in it for you if you spill the beans.

<p>For years, the Halo Insider Program has enabled loyal fans to hear about the latest Halo playtests. It’s been discovered that PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5 will be able to take part in future test sessions.</p>



<p>The Halo news keeps coming thick and fast—especially if you’re on PlayStation! First, the bombshell announcement that we knew was coming—but still hit hard all the same—was that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Remake is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. It’s the latest ground to be broken between Xbox and PlayStation. We’ve now seen for ourselves that PS4 and PS5 gamers can even test Halo before new games launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-4-amp-playstation-5-owners-can-playtest-future-halo-games">PlayStation 4 &amp; PlayStation 5 Owners Can Playtest Future Halo Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This gives us new energy. Credit to 343</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s likely many of you have been part of the Halo Insider Program for a while. One of the biggest perks is the ability to “Participate in public ‘flights’ (hands-on playtests) of in-progress Halo game releases and provide feedback to our development teams.”</p>



<p>Ordinarily, this benefit has been reserved for Xbox and PC owners. This is no longer the case as the Halo Insider Console Flighting settings on your personal account now have new options.</p>



<p>We’ve tested this out ourselves, logged in, and can confirm you’ll now see some new PlayStation options for Halo Insider:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 4 Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even last-gen users won’t miss out! Check out <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">grunt.api</a>‘s post to see it for yourself.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, rumors are swirling that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-live-service-rumor-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-service Halo game is possibly in the works</a>. There could be even more stuff happening behind the scenes that we’re not aware of yet. All this means is there’s a good chance new Halo content is on the way that needs testing, and PlayStation gamers will get to help.</p>



<p>Is this the best time to be a PlayStation fan? Will you pick up Halo: Combat Evolved remake or test out new Halo titles on PS4 or PS5? Let us know, and share your thoughts on how bizarre this all is via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Sharkmob has announced the imminent end of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a free battle royale title with a vampiric twist. The game launched in 2021 but was sunsetted in a way in 2023 when the team announced it would no longer be providing updates to the game.</p>



<p>Now, the squad at Sharkmob is preparing for a complete shutdown, taking the servers offline and jamming a stake into the heart of Bloodhunt for good on April 28, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodhunt-laid-to-rest">Bloodhunt, Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent release</a>, the team at Sharkmob revealed the incoming shutdown of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;offline.</p>



<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release mentioned that the game will remain <strong>fully playable </strong>until that date, but when it comes around, the game will no longer be available to download or play. To prepare for the shutdown, Sharkmob has delisted tokens, but the in-game store will remain open if you want to spend any residual credits you might have.</p>



<p>In the closing words of the release, Sharkmob wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2022, Bloodhunt launched on Steam, moving out of early access and pulling in quite a few players for a niche, indie battle royale game. It peaked at 29,475 players on Valve’s flagship platform, but checking the numbers now, just 603 concurrent users were logged on in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Bloodhunt hasn’t broken 1,000 concurrent players on Steam since October 2024.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt taken offline? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a></li>    </ul>

    
    <p><span>Inspired by Wizardry, Ultima, and Shin Megami Tensei.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Unison Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/unison-games">Unison Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Descent of Lunaris" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/descent-of-lunaris">Descent of Lunaris</a></em>, “a love letter to classic dungeon crawlers” inspired by games like <em>Wizardry</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, and <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [96 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1002726"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Unison Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Set in the year 2070, a lunar mining operation uncovers an impossible signal emanating from deep within the <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>. The moment it is unearthed, the base’s machines turn violent, slaughtering most of the inhabitants. A team of operatives from across the globe is dispatched to descend into the newly uncovered world, uncover the cause, and confront truths that will change human history forever.</p><p><strong>Explore, Survive, Descend, Repeat</strong></p><p>Players aren’t simply fighting to survive another descent, they’re unraveling a mystery that asks difficult questions about the nature of humanity itself. Every floor deepens the uncertainty: are you discovering the truth, or being led somewhere you were always meant to go? Are you investigating, or are you the one on trial? This is a dungeon crawler for a new generation: one that remembers the past, embraces the present, and peers unflinchingly into a future that may be darker than we expect.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Modernized dungeon crawling</p><p>In <em>Descent of Lunaris</em>, players will navigate a sprawling network of grid-based levels hidden beneath the lunar surface, each one designed with branching paths, environmental storytelling, and dark secrets. As they descend deeper, dungeons evolve beyond industrial corridors and lunar rock into surreal landscapes shaped by an unknown source. Familiar structures and mythologies appear twisted and distorted, constantly shifting the tone of exploration from eerie discovery to psychedelic nightmare.</p><p>Exploration isn’t just about <a title="Genres > Survival [477 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, as every area is filled with strange characters who could be allies, enemies, or something in between depending on player choices. Unlocking hidden passages, uncovering optional bosses, and piecing together fragments of story, turns the descent itself into a narrative arc: each area not only tests your party’s endurance and combat ability, but also reveals unsettling glimpses of humanity’s reflection in the eyes of something that should not exist.</p><p><strong>Hybrid Combat System</strong></p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em> pushes dungeon-crawling combat beyond a single style by fusing two classic RPG approaches into one seamless experience. At its core, the game features traditional JRPG turn-based battles, where party formation, skill usage, and resource management are key to surviving attrition across long dungeon runs. Every choice matters: when to heal, when to unleash powerful abilities, and when to conserve resources for what’s still ahead.</p><p>But the deeper players go, the rules change. Encounters shift into tactical grid-based battles, expanding the battlefield and forcing players to think in terms of positioning, movement, and area control. These encounters allow for larger groups of enemies, multi-phase boss fights, and environmental hazards that transform combat into a puzzle of survival. Players must constantly adapt by reshaping party formations, experimenting with subclasses, and tailoring strategies to the unique demands of each fight. The system rewards foresight, creativity, and bold risk-taking, creating a rhythm where every new area feels distinct and unpredictable.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002727"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Team Customization</strong></p><p>Every operative in <em>Descent of Lunaris</em> can be shaped and refined to match their preferred approach to exploration and combat. Abilities can be tailored and upgraded, allowing players to reinforce core strengths or experiment with hybrid builds. Unlocking subclasses transforms an operative into something entirely new: a frontline fighter who develops healing skills, or a support specialist who learns to manipulate battlefield control. A deep and complex affinity system and individual stat point customization creates a nearly infinite number of potential party builds to deal with any situation. Unique gear modifiers, leadership abilities based on what character is commanding your team, and unlockable passive traits layer together to create a vast well of replayability.</p><p>Distorted environments and surreal enemy encounters will demand team flexibility. A squad built for brute force might struggle against psychological or environmental hazards, while a carefully balanced team can adapt and endure. No two parties will be alike. <em>Descent of Lunaris</em> rewards players who experiment, iterate, and discover their own path through the nightmare beneath the lunar surface.</p><p><strong>Atmospheric Visuals and Sound</strong></p><p>From the first step onto the lunar base, players are immersed in a stark industrial science-fiction aesthetic: cold metal corridors, dim control rooms, and the humming of heavy machinery. This grounded foundation sets the stage for the descent into the unknown. As they explore deeper, the visuals evolve into something stranger. Sharp, evocative, and often unsettling 2D character and creature art enmesh with (and somehow still stand apart from) the modern 3D dungeon environments, creating a visual tension between the familiar and the alien. Surfaces glitch, perspectives warp, and familiar structures become distorted echoes of human civilization. The player isn’t just moving deeper into the moon, but into something very old and likely hostile.</p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em>‘ soundscape reinforces this growing instability with a creeping sense of unease. The soundtrack, curated from underground musicians and experimental producers, guides the player through tonal shifts: industrial rhythms in the early levels, sparse ambient textures filled with dread, and distorted psychedelic beats as reality begins to fracture. Each floor of the dungeon is an escalation. More surreal, more distorted, and more unnerving, pulling the player further from the safety of reality and deeper into the nightmare beneath.</p><p><strong>What Have We Done?</strong></p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em> is Unison Games’ love letter to the <a title="Genres > Dungeon RPG [81 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/dungeon-rpg">dungeon RPGs</a> that first defined the genre. It carries forward that classic grid-based exploration to merge with <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,827 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> turn-based combat and party-building strategies that recalls experiences from titles like <em>Wizardry</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>. With a haunting narrative and a mission that challenges not just survival but the very nature of humanity, this is a dungeon crawler for a new generation.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> currently has less wishlists on Steam than the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> dating sim. It's ranked 173rd as of writing, behind the Killer Bean game at 73rd, and the Gothic remake in 17th place. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> seems to be hogging the spotlight right now, and with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 set to come out in roughly two weeks, should Treyarch and Activision Blizzard be worried?</p>
<p>Well, one thing is for certain, Call of Duty hasn't had this much competition in a while. The obvious challenger is Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">which not only is easily outperforming any other entry in the series in over a decade</a>, but has outright fired shots at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">Call of Duty's recent tendency to focus on celebrity over realistic modern military aesthetics</a>.</p>
<p>We've already seen some drastic shifts from the standard Call of Duty strategy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">The game is cutting off some of the gaudier cosmetics available in previous games</a>, resigning them only to Warzone while keeping the newest iteration of multiplayer rooted in the expected setting. Would this have happened if Battlefield wasn't speaking directly to the FPS crowd? Maybe, maybe not - but it seems the competition to the FPS throne has caused the needle move for the CoD franchise to some degree. Is that why we’re seeing the CoD franchise so far down the wishlists on Steam?</p>

</figure>
<p>Battlefield 6’s success is one factor, but elsewhere we’re seeing less direct competitors, such as Arc Raiders, which looks to be an exceptional release in the extraction shooter scene. Regardless of how things play out, Call of Duty hasn't had such a contested release for years. Such are the dangers of sitting on the throne for too long.</p><p>However, even when online sentiment seems stacked against Call of Duty, there are several factors to why Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may not be popping off too much on Steam ahead of its release. For one, between 2018 and 2022, Activision has been selling Call of Duty titles on <a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, which previously was home to just Blizzard games. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/call-of-duty-stint-on-battle-net-was-supposedly-a-resounding-failure-3468723">This ended up being a bad move for Call of Duty</a>'s PC performance, but it's entirely possible that a portion of PC players learned to see Battlenet as the go-to platform for the series.</p>
<p>Then there's the Microsoft Store on PC, another alternative to Steam that isn't nearly as popular. Nonetheless, Microsoft made a real effort to push Call of Duty on Game Pass (both for console and PC) with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">breaking records for the service as a result</a>. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7 is releasing on Game Pass day one next month</a>, which could certainly account for a sizeable portion of the PC playerbase.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's the fact that Call of Duty has always had a strong foothold on consoles. On day four of the FTC vs Microsoft hearing, former Activision Blizzard King CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1676068765560127489/photo/1">stated that only 25% of Call of Duty daily active players were on PC</a>, based on 70m daily active users. It's worth noting that 51% of that figure would be attributed to Call of Duty Mobile, and that these are stats for Call of Duty in general, not just the latest mainline Call of Duty release. Regardless, PC is a sizeable slice of the overall playerbase, but a big slice either way.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Activision</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With all this in mind, what does this say for Call of Duty right now? Black Ops 7 will, in all likelihood, still sell like hot chocolate on a cold day. Perhaps these early indicators of Steam interest (or lack thereof) hints at the consequences years of varying PC storefront strategies can have on early adoption on the platform, rather than some drastic fumble from the FPS giant.</p><p>Or maybe it's one small crack in faded armour. Time will ultimately tell if Call of Duty manages to maintain its stranglehold on the genre it's dominated for so long (as well as the fall season, in general), or whether Battlefield 6 and other big releases can capitalise on a general fatigue within the FPS genre to really mix up the shooter space in a meaningful way.</p>

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="17cca6068e279"><a title="Super Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17cca6068e279/super-mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Eight years ago today, a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> launched on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>We've said so much over the years about this incredible entry from Nintendo, we won't go over it all again here. But <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1982703457338540178">a recent post</a> from ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura caught our eye and we simply felt compelled to highlight it, if only for how old it instantly made us feel.</p>
<p>Imamura-san highlighted Odyssey's anniversary and drew an amusing comparison to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>. Essentially, eight years prior to the N64 classic puts Nintendo right in the middle of the Famicom/NES days. The company would subsequently launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> all before our favourite plumber would dive headfirst into the 3D realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It’s unbelievable that this is a game from 8 years ago! Eight years before Super Mario 64 was still the heyday of the Famicom, and I myself was a student back then."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, since Odyssey, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Super Mario Maker 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. Sigh... it's a different world we live in now, huh?</p>
<p>Naturally, we're confident Nintendo is simply taking its time to ensure it delivers a new 3D Mario title worthy of its remarkable legacy, but it just goes to show how quickly the company could churn out bonafide classics back in the '80s and '90s.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, however, if nothing else it just makes us feel so very, very old. How has it been eight years already? That's nearly a <em>decade</em>, for goodness' sake!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode-officially-called-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow.1335916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 battle royale mode has finally been revealed and will officially be called Battlefield REDSEC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">As rumoured</a>, it'll launch tomorrow, and it'll be free-to-play.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios revealed the mode with <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155">a short post on the official Battlefield X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, which included a link to a gameplay trailer that'll go live tomorrow, alongside the mode itself going live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll have more official knowledge on the mode tomorrow when the gameplay trailer goes live, which will likely <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news">be followed by a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a>, though for now we do have other claims from ModernWarzeon, the X (formerly Twitter) account who initially leaked the REDSEC title and correctly claimed it would be shadow dropped tomorrow.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, Battlefield REDSEC will arrive with a Duos and Squads queues, letting players hop in as teams of two or teams of four, with a maximum player count of 100 players for matches.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC will also be arriving alongside Season 1 for Battlefield 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which, as I noted in my preview,</a> is adding a couple of stellar Conquest maps with Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood, but a couple of lacklustre game modes with the permanent and limited time modes to come. What makes the arrival of REDSEC even more exciting is that it'll be a peek at what is arguably going to be the best map in Battlefield 6, Eastwood, since the opening map for REDSEC is set in Southern California.</p>



<p>REDSEC is EA and Battlefield Studio's response to Call of Duty: Warzone, and it could not have come at a more opportune time for Battlefield since the Call of Duty brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to be in an identity crisis</a>. It also seems like EA and Battlefield Studios are taking advantage of Battlefield 6 launching more than a month ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, capitalizing on FPS players who would otherwise be spending their time waiting for the new Call of Duty to release.</p>



<p>Of course, they could still be doing that while playing Battlefield 6, dropping it for Black Ops 7 when that arrives in November, but for now EA has the chance to get its hooks into players that would otherwise not give Battlefield the time of day. We'll see how REDSEC does when it arrives tomorrow.</p>

            <p>What happened today? Well, Astarion said something sassy, Lae'zel tried to teach Gale how to build a shed, and Shadowheart wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> of Shar-themed parody of 'Is This The Way To Amarillo'. That's about how I imagine the journal entries a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mod lets you write as part of an impressive in-game diary system will go.</p>
<p>Well, that and at least 100 words per day of moaning about having a little squid thing in your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/19332?tab=description">Tav's Journal</a> and has been developed by Mazzle23. It repurposes a clever tool they created for custom in-game mod instruction pages the other month, letting the player take simple quest logs and turn them into detailed diaries packed with entries in which you can document whatever you like. So, when you look back through the events of a playthrough, instead of Larian's default synopses, you'll have unique personal records of what you were doing or thinking at whatever point.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's aimed at the likes of those who get really deep into roleplaying or completionists who might be noting down details to return to, taking the sort of writing you might have done on a physical notepad up until now into the game itself.</p><p>Assuming you're in it to feel more in the shoes of your tadpole-brained adventurer, you can kick off as you would in physical DnD by filling out the character profile and biography section for your character. Mazzle23 boasts of "large text areas for detailed storytelling and notes", so feel free to go full War and Peace if you've time and a person in mind whose life thus far can't be summed up swiftly. Handily for more verbose narrative-weaving entries, the mod's diaries come with their own auto-save system and the ability to jump between editing and read-only modes.</p>
<p>They also include two kinds of to-do list, with the one for long-term goals mirroring the usual quest log, while the other provides for day-specific tasks "tied to particular journal entries" which I assume you'll set up yourself. 'Tell Gale he smells, then laugh when he cries' for instance.</p>
<p>The aesthetically-pilled will be glad to learn that the mod boasts some visual customisation too, with six page themes to pick from and multiple fonts, in case you can't feel truly at one with your dwarf unless you're scrawling across a stone tablet in Comic Sans. Any worries about having to ruin previous work in order to tailor a diary to a fresh playthrough have been planned for, with each character being able to create and maintain their own simultaneously, while you can also duplicate journals if you want templates or backup copies.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a really impressive thing to have pulled off, with Mazzle23 noting than an option to export journals as PDFs and auto-tracking for in-game stats are among the additions they're working on for future updates. If you fancy giving BG3 journaling a go, you'll need grab both the <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases">BG3 script extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18883?tab=description">Mazzle's EZ-Documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>
Is it bad that I find the office labyrinth of Pager rather cosy? Is it a sign that I have finally gone full 9-to-5 zombie? Or have I simply been mugged on Memory Lane by a composite of 90s aesthetics and technologies - pebbly Macintosh wallpaper patterns, mock-Bauhaus prints and yes, pagers, though I never owned one of those as a kid. 
</p>
<p>
I even like the background whine of the omnipresent CCTV cameras, which grows abruptly piercing as I walk beneath them. These are very much the wrong emotions for anything that bills itself as influenced by Kafka. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Kafka genre, I am sorry.

<p>
Created by the evidently self-deprecating bilge, and available in full now on <a href="https://bilgetbd.itch.io/pager/devlog/1095316/pager-full-version-is-out-now">Itch.io</a> with a browser demo, Pager is 60 floors worth of laidback 1-bit dread. You are some kind of office worker. Your boss sends you instructions via pager. The instructions tend to be things like "take this box to room 4". You go to room 4 and it's full of fish swimming by the light of distant stars. The next instruction is to jump three times. Pager does not have a jump button.
</p><p>
It's a gentle spoof of corporate ladder-climbing, a send-up of arbitrary and unknowable bosses and bureaucracies. It mixes humour with horror with a surprising sleepiness. There are a couple of soft jump-scares in the demo, but I was more unnerved by the crackling noise emitted by the butterfly you occasionally find perched on a coffee cup. Butterflies should not crackle. Still, even the butterflies can't wholly undermine the peace I glean from these mostly dark rooms full of dotcom memorabilia. Kafka aside, Pager's inspirations include Severance, Lynch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Serial Experiments Lain and Sonny Boy. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Lain-alike, I am sorry.
</p>
<p>
I'm not as bowled over by the demo (which includes the first 10 floors) as I thought I might be, after cooing over the screens. I think the scenarios could be longer, and perhaps wittier. They have a certain dad joke energy, at times - a touch of WarioWare minigame, but couched in a way that leads you to expect something more fiendish.</p>
<p>The developer comments on the Itch.io page that Pager "shouldn't give you any satisfaction", and do you know, I feel like I might ultimately be dissatisfied by a game that declines to give me any satisfaction. But perhaps it's a wind-up - the trailer includes a few scenarios that seem more elaborate and chilling, and the individual puzzles appear to follow a larger story. At the very least, I think it's worth you firing up the demo, especially if you think human art peaked with the launch of Kid Pix. Pager is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to upgrade your laptop without blowing your budget. In fact, you don’t even need to spend more than $500 on a reliable device that’s ready to take on everyday tasks, multitasking, and even some light gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Right now, the 15.6-inch HP laptop is down to $499, after a steep 71% off its original price of nearly $1,700.</a> You’re saving an unbelievable $1,200, and this model is only $100 more than the entry-level version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It’s also the lowest we’ve seen it drop to in 30 days. Act fast to grab yours, as the discount might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Responsive, Fast Performance for Work and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. You’re getting that sleek silver finish in a slim, portable frame. It’s lightweight enough to carry around all day without feeling like it’s dragging your shoulder down. Power-wise, though, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>The laptop is powered by an Intel N100 processor (quad-core, up to 3.4GHz) for responsive performance for all your tasks. It’s not built for heavy creative workloads, but it’ll handle most regular workdays without slowing you down. With the processor, you’ve got 32GB of RAM for efficient multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that offers a huge space to store all that you own. It also runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll get to work on one of the most user-friendly, efficient systems out there.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD anti-glare display pushes detailed visuals that are easier on the eyes. Whether you’re working on presentations or watching a movie, picture quality stays vibrant and sharp. Battery life is just as impressive. Most of it will depend on how you use it, of course, but you can expect to get through a few hours without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a full set of modern connectivity options that include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and a smart AC power pin. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Considering how you’d normally pay over $1,000 for a device with all these features, grabbing the laptop for under $500 feels like a steal</a>. It’s got impressive visuals, a reliable processor, sufficient space, and much more at a discount.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For over two decades, Microsoft has been charging Xbox owners anywhere from $4 to $10 a month for access to online multiplayer. The full suite of features was bundled as Xbox Live Gold and has since morphed into being part of Game Pass. The company is now reportedly exploring doing away with that fee for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">its next-gen console</a>, bringing it more in-line with PC gaming where the perk is provided by companies for free.</p> <p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">by<em> Windows Central</em></a>, the “current plan” is for the next Xbox to have no paywall for multiplayer. The outlet adds that “it remains to be seen if that plan actually plays out into reality,” but it sounds like there is at least serious consideration within Microsoft for abandoning the last remnants of its Xbox Live legacy with the arrival of the new system or systems which are currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">rumored to be releasing near the end of 2027</a>.</p>

 <p>It would be another seismic shift for the company’s gaming division which has long collected this multiplayer tax in exchange for the ability to play annual hits like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>NBA2K </em>online. While it’s become standard to allow players on console to access free-to-play games without making them pay for platform memberships, forcing players to pay for online gameplay in premium titles like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> has generated massive amounts of what feels like effectively passive income for the respective console makers.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how many of Game Pass’ millions of subscribers are currently enrolled simply to play with friends online, but that benefit alone is responsible for a huge portion of the cost of the most expensive tier of the program. While Game Pass Ultimate for console users <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">was recently raised to $3</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">0</a>, the service is still just $16.50 on PC where <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and other live-service hits can all be played online for free. Ditching the multiplayer paywall on a more Windows PC-like next-gen Xbox would also require overhauling those pricing schemes.</p> <p>If the plan does go through, there will be two immediate questions: Why did Microsoft spend all of those previous years charging Xbox users for multiplayer? And how will Sony and Nintendo continue to justify charging for multiplayer on the upcoming PlayStation 6 and current Switch 2? Competition between platforms is good, and Microsoft providing valuable and meaningful alternatives in the future would be one way to help pressure both Sony and Nintendo into doing the same.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-live-event">When is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was all yellow. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Fortnite Live Event Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Observing the propensity of intense emotions to precede humanity’s irrational behaviors, the almighty AI begins to alter the mental states of those deemed “unstable” to create a safer, sanitized future.</p><p>Primus constructs Enforcer Decem, a warrior capable of diving into bizarre digital recreations of paranoid minds called Mirrormazes to destroy destructive thoughts. After a failed mission wipes Decem’s memories, set out to relearn the reason for his existence by retrieving memory fragments scattered across a futuristic utopia. Along the way, seek out the dark secrets behind the seemingly perfect world Decem was created to maintain.</p><p>Dash and slash through Mirrormares, mental anguish manifesting as mechanized foes. Decem leaves a temporary trail of light in his wake, and his Spatial Retrace ability stops time, empowering him to instantly teleport back to any point of the trail. Retrace to set up enemy-interrupting surprise attacks from unexpected angles, and solve mind-bending puzzles where the confines of time and space block the path forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Battle behemoth mechanical bosses with tactical thinking and keen spatial awareness, manipulating time and space to Decem’s will. Create a personalized fight style with seven Primary Combat Modules and twenty Secondary Modules for a custom combination of light and heavy strikes, charge attacks, counters, stances, and much more.</p><p>Encounter other Enforcers, learn about their missions, and explore a visually stunning world across crumbling ruins and bustling cities. Discover the forgotten past and determine humanity’s future in one of five multiple endings. Enjoy an immersive story with minimal enemy resistance, or fight the mind’s hardest battles with three different difficulties tailored for both action game veterans and newcomers.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Retrace the Light - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwbBBaK_SJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/time-manipulation-action-adventure-game-retrace-the-light-launches-november-20-for-pc-later-for-ps5-and-xbox-series]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft revolutionized online multiplayer in the console space with Xbox Live in 2002. And ever since then, playing games online has come at a cost for Xbox owners. But that might not be the case going forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/">the next-gen Xbox system</a>, according to a new report.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" rel="nofollow ">Windows Central</a> states that "the current plan is for the next Xbox specifically to have no paywall for multiplayer." This would be a notable change, as an (at least) Xbox Game Pass Essential subscription is needed for online multiplayer for Xbox at this time. However, Microsoft doesn't charge for access to free-to-play multiplayer games, like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone--two of the most popular games in the world.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally X Is Good, But Has Issues</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Another reason for this possible change comes from the fact Windows Central reports that the next-gen Xbox will offer a console experience combined with a full Windows PC interface, if desired. As such, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds</a>, the next-gen Xbox would then allow access to various PC storefronts, such as Steam and <a href="http://battle.net/" rel="nofollow ">Battle.net</a>. If Microsoft were to keep charging for online multiplayer, then the theory goes those owners might just forgo the Xbox Store and utilize Steam instead on the device.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">next Xbox would be "a very premium, very high-end curated experience."</a> She also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">reconfirmed that Xbox was working on new hardware</a>, after rumors surfaced that Microsoft might exit the console space.</p><p>Microsoft is also apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-xbox-cloud-gaming-plan-with-ads-is-officially-in-testing-microsoft-confirms/1100-6535714/">testing out a free Xbox Cloud Gaming plan with ads</a>. This would have players watch a couple of minutes of video ads, for example, before having access to a curated selection of games or possibly ones they already own. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/">Halo games will be on PlayStation going forward</a>, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>

When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p>

<p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, explaining that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><p>The question remains of whether Halo Studios was required to use generative AI when making the game. And for that, an Xbox representative told Rolling Stone that no such mandate exists.</p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," the Xbox representative told the publication in a later statement.</p><p>This comes at an interesting time for Microsoft/Xbox and the games industry at large. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-admits-xbox-hasnt-protected-its-creative-teams-but-doing-so-is-very-important/1100-6535690/" data-ref-id="1100-6535690">recently admitted</a> that the company doesn't always do the best at protecting the creativity of its staff. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> despite the myriad layoffs, with a report suggesting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the company's astronomical profit goals could be doing more harm to Microsoft</a> than good. And some studios, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">Krafton Inc.</a>, are going all in artificial intelligence, with prominent developers saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">the technology should be embraced</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">game developers are selling themselves short</a>.</p><p>Still, it's quite fascinating to see an Xbox exclusive make the jump to PlayStation. It really does seem like Microsoft is leaning into its latest marketing strategy, which purports that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">everything is an Xbox</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-next-car-could-also-be-your-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-cloud-gaming/1100-6534573/" data-ref-id="1100-6534573">even your car</a>.</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
