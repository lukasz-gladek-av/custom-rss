            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a conundrum: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">Cooperative board games</a> have wide appeal, but they tend to have a singular problem. Because everyone around the table wants to win, rather than genuine cooperation, there’s a tendency for groups to accept plans suggested by the most experienced or able player. Of the various ways to prevent this, the most successful has been to give players hidden information they’re not allowed to communicate.</p><div catalogid="ca7f5cd0-93c8-4c39-8f04-3dc1337b1477" id="233757"><div id="233757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Take Time Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme example is 2018 game <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Me7G?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mind</a> where players aren’t allowed to talk at all, and simply have to rely on their innate sense of timing to lay cards in the correct numeric order. Take Time belongs in this group, but it’s trying to use a set of novel, simple mechanics to chart a worthwhile course between no communication at all, and heavyweight cooperative planning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within, which you can sense by its weight. First up there’s a player deck of numeric cards, 24 in all, embossed in gold and set against fetching, complimentary shades of white and dark blue. Beneath there are a set of 12 envelopes, also embossed in gold and set with luminous art pieces depicting colorful, stylized scenes from nature. It’s a salutary lesson in how simple yet highly effective graphic design and artwork can elevate everyday game components into something glorious and eye-catching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the envelopes contain four clock discs, each with six points. While these are thinner cardboard and lack the gold that elevates the cards and envelopes, they’re still delightful things, carrying more of that rich, stylish nature art in slightly more muted colors. You’ll be playing cards at each of the points, and as soon as they’re on the table, the whole thing springs to life visually. The final component is a set of punch tokens which contain a clock hand and several cogs. They’re chunky and a little drab compared to everything else in the box, but that’s fine: they take a back seat during most of the play time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game rules are very simple. Each player gets a hand of number cards which come in two colors that run from 1 to 12. In the center of the table is a clock face with six segments. One of these will be the starting segment and your goal, as a group, is to play cards so that the total in each segment runs from lowest in the starting segment and ascends to the highest in the final segment. The catch? Most of your cards must be played face down, and you’re not allowed to talk about your plays while making them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you start to make logical deductions about what people are likely to have played. It’s up to the players – without discussion – to decide who’s going first so, intuitively, someone with a low card will likely play into the starting space and the group will understand that is probably a one, or a two. If the next player plays into the next space, it’s a good bet they’ve played a two (ties count as being part of the ascending order) or a three. Cards played straight into the final space are probably high, and so on. On this basis you can begin to figure your way around the puzzle, although deciding where to play your limited number of face-up cards is still an interesting choice. If no one reaches to open the play, for example, then it’s likely nobody has a low card so starting with a face-up mid-range option might be wise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each pack contains four clock faces and, from the very first challenge, there are additional requirements to frustrate you. That first face, for instance, requires the first segment to have a single white-color card in it, and the last segment can contain no more than three cards. So you can’t just dump high-values into that final space mindlessly and call it a day, as once you hit the three-card limit there’s a good chance the penultimate space might end up containing a higher total.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the difficulty begins to scale, you’ll start making use of the game’s most ingenious aspect. Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to plan and strategize before anyone has looked at the cards they’ve been dealt. Initially this looks of limited value: how can you plan when you don’t know what values anyone has at their disposal? But there are still things you can do. The card colors are public knowledge, for example, as it’s reflected on the card backs, so in that first clock you can quickly see how many white cards have been dealt and whether you’re likely to have a low-value card to play into its first segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. The rules are purposefully vague about what you can discuss in this phase, only explicitly disallowing “codes or signals” during card play. This leaves cunning players with a wealth of ways to approach the game and increase the group’s chances. No spoilers, but once you understand the game flow you can be surprisingly creative in terms of forming a plan, and when imaginative proposals pay off on a difficult clock it is incredibly satisfying. But remember that you have to adhere to the dictum that you must not communicate in any way, even with devised codes, during the card-play phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a limited-communication cooperative game before, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwNpg?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hanabi</a>, or Take Time’s spiritual predecessor The Mind, you’ll know this rule is hard to enforce. Sometimes a player forgets, and blurts something out by accident, or the preceding player will instinctively react to a play with a wince or a knowing smile, all of which gives out useful information. Some players find this vagueness troublesome: if that’s you, be aware that Take Time has nothing to ameliorate this issue. If not, it can actually be quite fun to watch how different groups interpret and enforce “no communication.” It’s a cooperative game, so it doesn’t really matter so long as you’re on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the game has no final fail state. If you mess up on a clock face, you get to have an additional face-up play for each failure to a maximum of three, and then you keep going until you either succeed or give up. In the latter case, you place the clock into the delightfully named Sleeve of Regrets and move on. To win overall you must go back and ensure you pass all 40 tests although once you’ve at least attempted them, you can open a final sleeve for additional replayability. But how you actually approach this is up to you: Take Time is more interested in being surprising and fun than it is in whether a group wins or loses. It’s clearly supposed to be a cozy, cooperative time to be enjoyed together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to strategize before anyone has looked at their cards.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the initial clock face, you may be wondering how any of the subsequent puzzles get hard enough to make you want to skip them. Each new face introduces new rules and wrinkles, but these never become overwhelming. After the first three faces, for instance, you’re not allowed to have any segment total higher than 24. Later, some segments disallow certain cards, while others force you to draw new cards, and an increasing proportion will have one or more placement rules. The design has a fantastic knack of pulling the rug out from strategies you’ve become used to. If your new clock disallows laying your lowest cards on the first segment, and your highest on the last, working out how to get them in ascending order suddenly becomes a whole lot more challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazingly, the lack of an absolute loss condition does little to undermine the excitement and thrill of play. Even with good communication and a full three bonus cards, there’s easily enough uncertainty about what’s around the clock to require thoughtful consideration before late cards, and ramp up the tension ahead of the final reveal. A group win is always gratifying, and it doesn’t take many losses before any given face begins to assume a daunting prospect, propelling you toward discussing new approaches, and offering ever-sweeter satisfaction when you finally take the win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7O0p?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEn83?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 19, 2025 7:24 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Some gamers view games almost entirely through the lenses of strategy or narrative, and Take Time offers neither of these pleasures. It is, however, brilliantly successful at suckering in pretty much everyone else, including reluctant players and family groups. Its simple rules and non-threatening structure appeal to all ages, and the way it remains packed with excitement and creative potential without complexity or even the threat of losing is almost magical. Don’t expect this to burn your brain, or even create particularly memorable play moments, but being able to spend such pleasant time with friends, family, or relative strangers is a memorable reward all in itself.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>But Riot says it’s considering rolling the BIOS requirement out to all players in <em>Valorant</em>‘s highest competitive ranking tiers (Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant), where there’s more to be gained from working around the anti-cheat software. And Riot anti-cheat analyst Mohamed Al-Sharifi says the same restrictions <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/2001831378401530297">could be turned on</a> for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, though they aren’t currently. If users are blocked from playing by Vanguard, they’ll need to download and install the latest BIOS update for their motherboard before they’ll be allowed to launch the game.</p>

<h2>Newer PCs are getting patched; older PCs might not be</h2>

<p>The vulnerability is known to affect four of the largest PC motherboard makers: ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. All four have released updates for at least some of their newer motherboards, while other boards have updates coming later. According to <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/382314">the vulnerability note</a>, it’s unclear whether systems from OEMs like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, or HP are affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asrock.com/support/Security.asp?iD=1">ASRock’s security bulletin</a> about the issue says it affects Intel boards based on the 500-, 600-, 700-, and 800-series chipsets; <a href="https://csr.msi.com/global/product-security-advisories">MSI</a> only lists the 600- and 700-series chipsets. <a href="https://www.asus.com/security-advisory/">Asus</a> is also missing the 800-series, but says the vulnerability affects boards based on even older 400-series Intel chipsets; <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/Security/2338">Gigabyte</a>, meanwhile, covers 600-through-800-series Intel chipsets, but is also the only vendor to mention patches for AMD’s 600- and 800-series chipsets (any motherboard with an AM5 socket, in short).</p>
<p>Collectively, all of these chipsets cover Intel’s 10th-generation Core processors and newer, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series and newer.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether the boards and chipsets that go unmentioned by each vendor aren’t getting a patch because they don’t <em>need</em> a patch, if they will be patched but they just aren’t being mentioned, or if they aren’t getting a patch at all. The bulletins at least suggest that 400- and 500-series Intel chipsets and 600- and 800-series AMD chipsets <em>could</em> be affected, but not all vendors have promised patches for them.</p>

                <p>A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge. But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo.</p><p>Inin Games shared the news that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-ditches-game-key-cards-for-a-physical-release-but-itll-cost-more/1100-6537110/" data-ref-id="1100-6537110">upcoming US and European run</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/r-type-dimensions-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-706122">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">production prices</a> as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well.</p><p>Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. </p><p>Nintendo hasn't issued any statement about this yet, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but the rumors suggest that smaller cartridges</a> are being offered in 16GB and 32GB sizes, both of which are cheaper than the standard 64GB cartridge. Publishers who wanted to sell Switch 2 games on physical cartridges were previously stuck paying for and using Nintendo's 64GB cartridge. The publishers who released larger games were also forced to use Game-Key Cards because their titles couldn't fit on a single cartridge. There's currently no indication that Nintendo is planning any cartridges bigger than 64GB to accommodate those larger games. If those were available, they might mitigate the need for Game-Key Cards.</p><p>The one bit of bad news from R-Type Dimensions III is that the game will be a little more expensive now that Inin Games is going for the physical cartridge. Regardless, Inin pledged to honor the original price for anyone who preordered the game before the change was made.</p><p>"We'd like to sincerely thank the community for the passionate discussion, the feedback, and the patience over the past days," reads <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement by Inin Games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a promising reversal for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">game key card haters</a> everywhere,<em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games has announced it will be able to support a physical release on Switch 2 that contains the entire game on the cartridge. How was it able to manage this feat? It said this was all thanks to Nintendo introducing additional SD card sizes for Switch 2, before later revoking all such claims.</p> <p>“We’re happy to share a positive update regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em>,” the company <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii">announced on Friday</a>. “There is no better timing: Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>

 <p>As a result, it said it would move forward with offering a physical version of the game on Switch 2 that wasn’t a game key card. The only difference is that the physical version will cost $10 more than the digital version to account for the production costs. This is good news, and essentially what every diehard fan and enthusiast collector has been begging Nintendo and its Switch 2 development partners to do from the start.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ININ Games retracts their statement about the new smaller Switch 2 carts. </p> <p>"There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information… <a href="https://t.co/V9yeCHynVR">pic.twitter.com/V9yeCHynVR</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2002067728631533570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But apparently Inin Games wasn’t supposed to reveal that this was all due to new cartridge sizes from Nintendo. The company deleted its original statement and followed up with a bizarre new one. “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,” the company corrected itself.</p>

 <p>It continued, “Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo. At this time, we can only confirm that our upcoming release <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> will be on a physical cartridge. No further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.” Mmhmm. Sure.</p>

 <p>The good news is that it sounds like other publishers may be able to take advantage of this new development moving forward, though some may still opt to do game key cards for performance reasons (running a game off an installation vs. a cartridge can improve loading times) or because of the cost savings. Up until now, the only Switch 2 cartridges available to developers were 64GB ones.</p>

 <p>Games that were too big, like<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, had to go the game key card route as a result. But it also meant that most small games found paying for the unneeded extra space prohibitively expensive. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> and a ton of other games were only released on Switch 2 as game key cards as a result. Hopefully, Square Enix and others follow the example now set by <em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on Thursday, December 18, and saw 21 awards handed out to deserving games, developers, and people. </p>



<p>This year, I was lucky enough to be selected <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as one of the judges</a> and had the opportunity to vote on 12 awards. Those included the likes of Music, Gameplay, Narrative, Game of the Year, and more. </p>







<p>While the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awards were given out</a> already, I thought it would be good to show the Insider Gaming audience how I voted this year. To be completely honest, it was a lot tougher than I expected.</p>



<p>Doing a ranked choice vote led to plenty of second guessing and dozens of pages of notes in my black and white marble notebook. There was even a time where I had my votes all ready to submit, only to start over by reviewing my notes again. Eventually, decisions were made and the ballots were sent in. </p>



<p>Not all of my selections won, but I was happy with how I voted and congratulate all of the winners. There really were so many incredible games this year that you could make a strong case for every game that was nominated, and even others that weren’t. But, without any more delay, here’s how I voted for The Indie Game Awards 2025.</p>

<p>All of the games under each category appear in the order that I voted. It was a ranked choice vote, meaning that I had to place the games in the order I felt they belonged. It wasn’t just a “pick one from this list”.</p>

<p>"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that," Nowakowski explained.</p><p>Nowakowski also pushed back against the idea that the mass layoffs happening in the video game industry today are due to AI's acceleration. Instead, he said the cuts are largely the result of games being canceled.</p><p>"Some studios have been going through turmoil; there were some project closures and so on, which led to many redundancies in the gaming industry; we've all seen that--it's been very dramatic in many cases. But, literally kill me here, but I don't recall a single time when it would be attributable directly to AI. At least I don't know about that."</p><p>And looking to the future, if AI is adopted more broadly, Nowakowski does not believe it will lead to net job losses overall. "I don't imagine that," he said.</p><p>This echoes what others have said, pointing to previous labor revolutions that impacted some jobs in the short term but boosted total employment overall on a longer timeline. Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0yT4ec9M6GobLC5ByN8pX3?si=0Vg8nv83RsyqI0LqfYTv-Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">workers whose job is "the task" may be at the greatest risk</a>.</p><p>The AI issue continues to be controversial, in part because of how the term is defined. Developers have been using versions of AI to make games for decades, after all. One of the newest forms of AI is generative AI, and it is baked into products that many game developers use, including Unreal Engine and Photoshop, among others. Recently, Larian's CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">drew backlash for his comments</a> on how the developer might use AI, and he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">plans to answer more questions about this in January. </a></p>

<p>"They've done an amazing job"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Square Enix had a holiday treat in store for us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">earlier this week,</a> when it dropped the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo on the Switch 2 eShop. Before the full game launches next year, you can now get an idea of what to expect by playing through the iconic opening sequence <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>But how does it hold up from a technical standpoint? Here to answer that very question are the experts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQoWX_Q94vs">Digital Foundry</a>, who have been diving into the demo to see what it can muster.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF notes that the Switch 2 <em>is</em> running the 'Intergrade' version of the game (as its name suggests), with all the improved bells and whistles that we previously saw on the PS5 re-release. The frame rate is still at 30fps, mind you, but we knew that already.</p>
<p>On a similarly optimistic note, Digital Foundry describes the HDR implementation as "excellent", with popping highlights and dark zones which don't appear washed out.</p>
<p>In terms of image quality, the game isn't fully comparable to any other console version. The image is a little soft, but "still clear enough", with some dithering weirdness when objects are in motion and across select surfaces. DF puts the Switch 2's approximate internal resolution count at 1080p, stating that it's "really, really beautiful in portable mode".</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like it's holding up really rather well. The DF analysis concludes that the demo is currently "one of the best looking games on Switch 2", though whether that all holds up for the final, much larger version remains to be seen.</p>
<p>That full version will arrive on Switch 2 on 22nd January, and any demo data that you get under your belt until then will carry over to the full release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As to be expected with seasonal content, new maps and weapons are planned for Battlefield 6. The studio says this content is being developed to "introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways."</p><p dir="ltr">This only gives players a vague sense of what to expect, but for Season 1, Battlefield 6 gained three <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-all-new-maps-and-vehicles/1100-6535770/">multiplayer maps</a>, more vehicles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-battlefield-6-weapons-in-season-1-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6535768/">several new weapons</a>, and some additional attachments. The content was rolled out in three separate phases, and it's likely future seasons could follow the same approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also touched on the game's free-to-play Redsec battle royale mode. The game currently doesn't feature a solo playlist, which has been highly-requested from the community, and the studio is aware of the interest and working to deliver an option for solo players.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield," the developer said. "Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer's post also included several statistics for Battlefield 6 in 2025. Players across multiplayer and Redsec played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours. This overall gametime resulted in 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives. Engineer was the most used class at 28%, but it was a close race with support players making up 27%, assault players at 26%, and the recon class was the least used at 19%.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, Battlefield 6 released Winter Offensive as the last update for Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-buggy-update-is-being-fixed-as-new-patches-scheduled-and-tournament-delayed/1100-6536891/">Winter Offensive had a rough launch</a>, which led to Battlefield Studios releasing a series of hotfixes and updates across all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game</a> in the US so far, toppling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which currently sits at No. 7 on the list.</p>

                <p>Christmas is around the corner and one of Universal Studios' biggest attractions is the meet-and-greet with The Grinch. Meeting Whoville's Christmas curmudgeon can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSVKYYOiRVD/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take up to over five hours</a> with the lines, but with social interactions going viral, it's hard not to resist a photo and a few minutes with the beloved monster.</p><p>The interactions are fairly quick; you can maybe get a quick question in, and then the photo, and be on your way. Fortnite creative developer <a href="https://x.com/ImmatureGamer/status/2001727399910867200" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Immature asked Mr. Grinch if he played Fortnite</a>. Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it.</p><p>"I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring. But I know they're always releasing new skins and characters. I heard that [Marty] McFly guy is in there now. I heard Eminem was in there--there's a bunch of new things. When are they going to put me in there? If I was in the game, it would be fantastic, but since I'm not..."</p><p>Considering the hundreds of character skins over the years, it feels surprising that the Grinch isn't in the game. Fortnite was quick to respond saying "No promises. But you're at least gonna have to get into the Christmas spirit first, Mr. Grinch."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2001730375001788601" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No promises.

The SpongeBob collaboration includes the Patty Wagon as a car cosmetic, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spongebob-might-not-be-the-only-paramount-cartoon-coming-to-fortnite-reports-suggest/1100-6536487/" data-ref-id="1100-6536487">reports also pointing to SpongeBob and Patrick appearing as sidekicks</a>.</p><p>The Back to the Future collaboration from the current battle pass is expanding on December 23, adding a Doc Brown skin and a DeLorean time machine car skin, which will be free in Fortnite for players who already own it in Rocket League. Winterfest will also expand existing music collaborations, with Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter each receiving holiday-themed skins and new jam tracks. Additionally, rumored but unconfirmed collabs like Home Alone and Batman Beyond could still appear, as there's some space left in the Winterfest schedule.</p>

<p>Just don't forget to feed them</p>

<p>Those of you of a certain age will remember <strong>Neopets</strong>. Arriving with a bang in 1999 as a free-to-play virtual browser game where you look after digital pets, it exploded in popularity, spawning merchandise, toys, video games, trading cards, and more. It's still pretty massive today, even!</p>
<p>On the video game side, things have been a little quieter on that front in recent years for console owners, (it's been 20 years since the last home console game), but that changes on <strong>26th</strong> <strong>March 2026</strong> with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/neopets_mega_mini_games_collection">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Acting as a sort of return to the heyday of Neopets, this collection brings together 25 classic Neopets minigames including Turmac Roll, where you roll a little turmac across the ground and collect fruit while avoiding obstacles, and Meerca Chase II, which is a bit like Snake.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still play most of these on a browser, but developer Outright Games has stated that these minigames have been updated with refreshed visuals and more-polished controls.</p>
<p>There's also a brand new minigame in the form of Starlight Symphony, and secret 27th one. DLC, seasonal events, story mode, and online leaderboards (all connected to your Neopets account if you wish) all round out the package.</p>

			<p>If you want to just relive your childhood in your free time, why not try Vice City in your browser?</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-vice-city-demo-is-now-directly-playable-in-a-web-browser-on-dos-zone-allowing-the-game-to-be-played-on-various-devices">GTA: Vice City Demo is Now Directly Playable in a Web Browser on DOS Zone, Allowing the Game to be Played on Various Devices</h2>



<p>While GTA: Vice City can be easily run on a potato PC, you will still need to download and install it via platforms like Steam. The game is also available for mobile devices based on Android and iOS, and will cost you a few bucks, but if you want to play it for free (and without downloading), you can now play it directly on your browser.</p>



<p>Originally released in 2002 on PlayStation 2 and later on PC and Xbox, Vice City is now playable on your browser, thanks to the DOZ Zone, which is currently hosting a technology demo on the website. The browser-playable version isn't an official release from Rockstar Games, but it's a fan-created port of the game. The project is powered by a technology demo built on WebAssembly and browser APIs, and uses open-source engine implementations like reVC to recreate Vice City's gameplay without installation.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GTA-Vice-City-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Wccftech</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the DOS Zone website, the game runs entirely in the browser and doesn't require any download or installation, unlike on a PC or mobile phone. As long as you have a modern browser like Chrome or Edge, you will be able to run it on any device of your choice. All you need to do is click on the "play demo" button, and you are good to go. On mobile, you will have dedicated touch interfaces, while on PC, you can play it via your keyboard/mouse or a controller. </p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the demo does not include the full original game assets. Players will be prompted to upload the files legally purchased from the Vice City copy in order to access the complete campaign. That said, you can still move around, drive a bike or car, and check out places to feel your childhood on the go. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868</link>
            <guid>1388596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>ModRetro, a company that makes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895"><span>retro handhelds and consoles that play older games</span></a><span> and that’s run by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has announced a new Chromatic device it’s making in collaboration with Luckey’s other professional endeavor: defense tech company Anduril Industries. The limited-edition handheld’s big selling point is that it’s made from the same metal Anduril uses to create its attack drones. Gross.</span></p> <p><span>The $349.99 </span><a href="https://modretro.com/products/anduril-chromatic-porta-pro-bundle"><span>Anduril Chromatic + Porta Pro Bundle</span></a><span> includes the handheld, headphones, and a charm of Anduril’s logo. The listing says that the device is made from the “same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones” and that if you’re looking for a retro gaming system that offers “performance and reliability under any and all conditions, there is no other option.” What kind of combat zone does ModRetro think people are playing </span><i><span>Tetris</span></i><span> in that they need something military-grade to play their games on?</span></p>

 <p><span>While we can speculate about what kind of environment someone might play a retro handheld gaming system in, this is ultimately the latest effort from a glorified arms dealer responsible for making weapons used in acts of war to cozy up to the retro gaming community. The video game industry and the military-industrial complex have long been deeply connected in ways too numerous to count, joining forces to use </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-army-call-duty-twitch-ign-g4-swagg-stonemountain64-1849844389"><span>games and live-streaming platforms to try to increase military recruitment</span></a><span> among Gen Z, but there is something particularly gross and fetishistic about selling people a Game Boy knock-off that is made to be as durable as an attack drone.</span></p>

 <p><span>As you might expect, retro gamers and historians are not having it.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pwr6abquzsshkgorh3bwxyn7/app.bsky.feed.post/3mae65fq75s2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreig67p74r3xwja3iwifm3aa5ghyeggevk4kylopx6v5tbhhhemtzoa"> <p lang="en">I say this with zero irony: if you are even tangentially a part of a retro video game community, it is your civic duty to push back against this company and shun anyone who doesn't.

              <p>2025 has been the most incredible year for indie gaming. Rather than one ultra-standout game, like last year’s <em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/">15 percent off</a>), we’ve been treated to a wide array of small-team, small-budget creations that have broken through to wider attention. And right now, nearly all of them are available at a decent discount in Steam’s Winter Sale.</p> <p>This is not a comprehensive list—like I said, it’s been an incredible year—and I want to make room for enormously accomplished games that haven’t had quite so much attention too. (Oh, and you won’t find that multi-million dollar game developed by hundreds of people here, even though all the so-called “indie” awards have abandoned all meaning and sense and allowed one such game to unfairly dominate attention and accolades.) Every one of these games is well worth your attention over the Christmas break, and now you don’t have to pay as much.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Peak</a></h2>  <p>Every year seems to have an indie climbing hit, and this year it’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">wonderful&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>. Ideally played in co-op, you and some buddies attempt to climb a mountain with the constant risk of making a mistake and pulling all your friends into disaster. And earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">it added cannibalism</a>!</p>

 <p><em>Peak</em> is currently 38 percent off, making it only <strong>$5</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/">Eclipsium</a></h2>  <p>One of the most striking and astonishing games in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> takes the walking simulator and turns it into a breathtaking work of horror and surrealism, with artwork like nothing else that’s ever existed. I spoke to the developer about how it was created <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">here</a>. At 20 percent off, it’s yours this holiday for just <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">Absolum</a></h2>  <p>One of the most popular indie games of 2025, roguelite beat ’em up&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em> is absolutely drowning in <a href="https://kotaku.com/absolum-review-streets-of-rage-4-impressions-beat-em-up-2000633646">incredible reviews</a>. It comes from the same team that brought us 2020’s <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/">65 percent off</a>), and likely would have scooped a bunch of awards this year if a certain other game hadn’t stolen them. Its already bargain price is now 20 percent lower, at <strong>$20</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/">Megabonk</a></h2>  <p>No one really knows for sure who developer Vedinad is, but it’s certainly very suspicious that the name spells “Danidev” backwards, which just happens to be the name of a YouTuber and developer who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMClFWa-fA&amp;t=381s">famously vanished</a> a few years back. Anyway, whoever they may be, they <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">had the integrity to withdraw</a> <em>Megabonk</em>, their fantastic 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, from contention for Best Debut Indie Game in this year’s Game Awards, on the basis that it’s not their debut game. (DaniDev made&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782210/Crab_Game/"><em>Crab Game</em></a>). Anyway, it’s brilliant, it’s ludicrously moreish, and now it’s 25 percent cheaper at just <strong>$7.49</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Urban Myth Dissolution Center</h2>  <p>Pixel horror visual novel&nbsp;<em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center&nbsp;</em>came out all the way back in February, and as such hasn’t been all that well remembered in end-of-year lists. So put that right! You’re investigating supernatural cases, untangling conspiracies, and collecting evidence, in order to bring about the dissolution of, well, urban myths. A 15 percent discount brings it down to just <strong>$15</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a></h2>  <p>Well, this one certainly hasn’t suffered for attention! A massive breakthrough hit, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is a 19th-century supernatural detective game in which you investigate the spooky disappearance of Evelyn Deane. Is it 2025’s <em>The </em><em>Case of the Golden Idol</em>? Yeah, that sounds about right. And despite only coming out less than two months ago, it’s already offering a 25 percent discount, making it now <strong>$15</strong> for the holidays.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">Öoo</a></h2>  <p>One of my absolutely favorite games of 2025, <em>Öoo</em> is a game about using bombs to explore a puzzle platform world. It’s called <em>Öoo</em> because you’re little round blob dude who can drop two bombs at a time, and that spells “ooo.” It’s so damned smart, with constantly innovative puzzles, a so-called <a href="https://thinkygames.com/features/metroidbrainia-an-in-depth-exploration-of-knowledge-gated-games/">metroidbrania</a> in which progress is only gated by ideas you haven’t had yet. It’s sublime, and now super cheap, discounted 20 percent to <strong>$8</strong>.</p> <hr>  <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170570/The_Drifter/">The Drifter</a></h2>  <p>Another game that I’m delighted to say has received a huge amount of attention this year,&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> is one of the best point-and-click adventures of 2025, and that’s facing strong competition. This tale of an Australian itinerant returning to his home town for his mother’s funeral is a compelling mystery and stunningly put together. Its ending is…silly, but it’s a brilliant time. It’s 15 percent off, yours for <strong>$17</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Old Skies</h2>  <p>Talking of stunning point-and-click adventures from this year, there’s also the incredible&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>. From stalwart adventure creator Wadjet Eye, this follow-up to&nbsp;<em>Unavowed</em> tells the tale of a time-travelling agent, Fia Quinn, taking clients on “vacations” to points in the past, with its episodic story slowly weaving itself into a larger conspiracy. It’s superb stuff, now down 20 percent to&nbsp;<strong>$16</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote</a></h2>  <p>Here’s why I love video games: One of the most well-respected and well-loved video games of 2025 is an exploration of the love of soccer as it was felt in Quito, Ecuador in 2001. And it obviously goes far deeper than that, telling a semi-autobiographical story that allows you a window into one kid’s world in a way only video games can offer. Incredible, moving stuff. It’s down a hefty 35 percent, now under <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a></h2>  <p>Mario von Rickenbach has been making fantastically interesting games as Playables for many years, each a minimalist experiment in art and interaction. The likes of&nbsp;<em>Kids</em>,&nbsp;<em>Plug &amp; Play</em>, <em>My Exercise </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cars</em> have all been joyful, but failed to get wider attention.&nbsp;<em>Time Flies</em> appears to be the well-deserved breakthrough, a slightly more game-like game in which you play as a fly trying to achieve all the items on a bucket list before its brief life is over. It’s an interactive toy, a wonderful piece of animation, and just all-round amazing entertainment. 35 percent off, it’s now <strong>$10</strong>.</p>

Earlier in the year, IO confirmed that one of Bond's trusted associates, Dr. Selina Tan, will be portrayed by English actress Gemma Chan.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with 007: First Light narrative director Martin Emborg to talk about the star power fueling his game, the potential pitfalls of revealing too much info too soon, and a little bit more about where Bond will run into Bawma during this adventure.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1kFDUmu_4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hT1kFDUmu_4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Bawma</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While the character of Bawma was being worked on before Lenny Kravitz officially signed on to the project, Emborg tells us that the star was a big part of creating the character who appears in the trailer shown during The Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," Emborg said, "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p dir="ltr">So who is Bawma, and what do we know about Aleph in Mauritania, the place where Bond will encounter him? Emborg says that Aleph is a perilous place for a young secret agent to try to infiltrate, and Bawma oversees it with an iron fist.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is a kingdom, and Bawma is its pirate king," Emborg says. "Aleph is one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Somewhere where, if you don't keep your wits about you, you probably won't make it out. When you first see it, you think it's going to be a high adventure, but the closer you get, you realize how dodgy it actually is. Then, once you enter it, you think, 'I should probably not be here.' It's really one of my favorite locations in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">When we asked him what will bring Bond to Aleph in the first place, Emborg didn't want to give too much away. "I think we have an amazing story lined up, and in my dream world, everyone would see the teaser trailer, immediately buy the game, and go in cold," he said. "I love teasing things, but I think the more context we provide in trailers, the less 'cold' players will be going in, so I prefer to keep things fresh."</p><p dir="ltr">He did, however, confirm one key thing: Bawma is <em>a </em>villain within 007: First Light, not <em>the</em> villain. There are still more bad guys to come.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274"></a><figcaption>007: First Light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Cards close to the chest</h2><p dir="ltr">While that "dream world" of players going in cold sounds nice, Emborg is well aware that his team needs to get the word out about its game and the cool things within. Still, while he understands that hype is important, he is also very mindful not to give <em>too</em> much away."I'm fully aware that when doing big entertainment like this, you need to show people what you've got and what they're in for," Emborg said. "I think this trailer is a great way to show something like Lenny off, but how deep do we go?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I've absolutely come to terms with the fact that you need to show some of these great things off," he continued. "In an ideal world, people would go in cold and have an amazing experience. People will still have an amazing experience with Bond either way, but I don't want to supply you with too much context."</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, the team's excitement as time marches closer to launch is palpable, and Emborg is especially eager for players to play through the story he and his team have created. "Having worked on something for this long, it's exciting to finally get here, and I'm really just looking forward to getting this in people's hands," Emborg said. "We're teasing little elements of the story, we're showing some of the places you're going and the people you're meeting, but the whole game is a great adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">In Emborg's mind, there's one piece of the puzzle that stands above the rest in terms of importance: the characters. "I think when you get the full picture, you go on a thrill ride that is, importantly, character driven," he says. "When you're making something that is Bond, the character is essential. Sure, you'll have the usual village of supporters and the globe-trotting adventure, but I'm really looking forward to people getting time with our version of James Bond, because he is a lot of fun."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9SBrID6Bc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YD9SBrID6Bc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>The doctor is in</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Among the key characters who drive a Bond adventure are his supporting team like Q and M, who give him not only his missions, but also his equipment for the job. Earlier this year, IO revealed one of those supporters in Dr. Selina Tan, played by Gemma Chan, who Emborg says made the character her own right from the start.</p><p dir="ltr">"We'd been talking to Gemma, and I had a character bio and an idea in my head of how I wanted Dr. Tan to be," Emborg said. "She came in and had a take where, afterward, I threw everything I'd prepared out, because she just nailed the character in a way I hadn't even thought of. She gave Selina Tan a kind of charm and quirkiness I hadn't anticipated, which was a joy."</p><p dir="ltr">For Emborg, Chan's unique approach, and the way it changed the character completely, is the mark of an actor at the top of their game. "That's what having great actors is like," Emborg said. "They do their homework and find an angle on the character that, in the best cases, you don't expect. The actor does a take and you think, 'Wow, I didn't see that coming.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Character-changing moments like Gemma Chan's take, according to Emborg, are a highlight of the entire narrative experience. "I love [moments like that]," Emborg said. "One of my favorite parts of working with actors is when you've prepared all this material, you've lived with these characters for a long time, and then the actor arrives in the booth and you have that 'eureka' moment; it doesn't always happen, but when it does, it makes you realize why that actor is such a heavy hitter."</p><p dir="ltr">007: First Light is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="edb5fbc1a7807"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/edb5fbc1a7807/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cards on the table: I am a big superhero fan and I always have been. I've read the comics, I've played the games, I've watched the movies, I've got the tattoos *<em>gulp</em>*. I am usually pretty adept at bending things to see the positives — heck, I can even defend <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong> on a good day — but the last few years have been real dark for us fans of caped crusaders.</p>
<p>There have been some high points: Marvel TV (on the whole) has been rather solid, I've played more <a href="https://marvelsnap.com/">Marvel Snap</a> than I care to admit, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_spider-man_2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> was far better than some folk give it credit for, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/?srsltid=AfmBOopmhffb2YHmoRmy92A3d1YDWR1E6byFUM4gydP0k8cD_Tp9FKBi">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> got its TGA flowers, and show me one animated film in the last five years that doesn't have <em>some</em> <strong>Spider-Verse</strong> DNA in it. But, generally, it has been a very long time since I've been able to say "I love superheroes" without needing to have a clarifying statement in the back pocket for the inevitable, and often completely valid, comeback.</p>
<p>The MCU has seen more misses than hits in the wake of <strong>Endgame</strong>, DC has had nothing magical to its name in a good decade unless its title begins with a "The", and the less said about the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC, yes <em>really</em>), the better.</p>
<p>But in 2025, that all changed. I started leaving the cinema feeling wholly optimistic, I stopped anticipating a fight whenever I logged a 4-star minimum MCU review on Letterboxd, and, most importantly for this site, I had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>. Superheroes are super again, and I couldn't be happier.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d9f0760985fe5"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f0760985fe5/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll get to the Switch-relevant stuff in just a moment, but first, let's remember all of the other good meat that 2025 has served up. Animated TV has been wonderful, with <strong>Your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</strong> — the best animated Spidey since <strong>Spectacular</strong> — as a personal highlight. Live-action has been the same; <strong>Daredevil: Born Again</strong> put me right back in mind of the OG Netflix series, <strong>Peacemaker</strong> was ace, and even though I had some gripes with <strong>Ironheart</strong> and its icky presentation of the joys of AI, there's no denying that its <em>heart</em> (heh) was in the right place.</p>
<p>Movies, too, have seen a real focus on quality stories over forward-thinking multiversal set-ups. Yeah, <strong>Captain America: Brave New World</strong> was guff, but <strong>Thunderbolts*</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> are the closest we've come to some Phase One magic in <em>yonks</em>. And <strong>Superman</strong>, gosh, Superman might just be the only film I've watched in 2025 that managed to make me feel positive about the world — and I watched <strong>Paddington in Peru</strong> for the first time this year, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Games have taken similarly optimistic steps. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> might have launched last year, but it's gone from strength to strength in 2025, and it still has my attention — an achievement that precisely <em>zero</em> other hero shooters can boast. The mobile tactics RPG <a href="https://www.marvelmysticmayhem.com/">MARVEL Mystic Mayhem</a> hasn't gobbled up quite as much of my time, but I like the little I have played of it, despite its pay-to-win trappings. And, without a VR headset on hand, I haven't checked out <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/marvels-deadpool-vr/3240283705987790/?srsltid=AfmBOooss_B1nlW01htYVPpigSuuYjE2gDynoAEpw0hoyLRMNVM5HWqc">Deadpool VR</a>, but hey, Geoff liked it!</p>

<p>All of this brings me to my beloved Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the game I knew would cap off my <em>super</em> 2025 and on which there was an awful lot riding. I was immensely fond of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> back in 2022, so to see Tribute and Dotemu turning to Marvel for a follow-up was pretty much a dream scenario for little old Jimmy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But do you know what brought the biggest smile to my face? The fact that this is clearly a game made by fans</em> <em>for</em> fans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loins girded, I booted up Cosmic Invasion on launch day, and I loved it (shock, horror). The 15-hero roster contained enough deep cuts to tickle me in a special 'you don't see <em>that</em> in the MCU' kinda way, while still landing on my familiar favourites. I got an unbelievable kick out of using the Cosmic Swap ability to rack up crazy combos, flinging enemies into the air as Captain America before telekinetically dunking them down a pit as Phoenix.</p>
<p>And there are few composers working today who can capture the soundscape of the SNES quite like Tee Lopes, who smashes it out of the park once again — but after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>, Shredder's Revenge and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4 DLC</a>, can we really be that surprised?</p>
<p>I know Cosmic Invasion might not have been for everyone (heck, I can totally understand some of the gripes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">our own Tom Massey</a> had with it), but it certainly was for me.</p>
<p>I could wax lyrical all day about the gorgeous pixel art, the way the Challenge structure encourages you to <em>actually use</em> the whole roster, or how the ace Annihilation comic book storyline has been adapted to fit the new medium. But do you know what brought the biggest smile to my face? The fact that this is clearly a game made by fans <em>for</em> fans.</p>
<p>We knew about the stacked voice cast before launch, but I will never tire of hearing the cartoon VAs — the voices that <em>defined</em> my childhood — returning to their roles once again. Everyone will have their favourites, but, to me, Alison Sealy-Smith <em>is</em> Storm, Cal Dodd <em>is</em> Wolverine. Heck, after a rewatch of <strong>The Spectacular Spider-Man</strong> (I didn't plan to mention it twice in one feature, I promise), Josh Keaton increasingly <em>is</em> Spidey.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9fc6c9326c4d5"><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fc6c9326c4d5/marvel-cosmic-invasion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And what about all of those callbacks? The way that She-Hulk breaks the fourth wall and calls out background cameos or genre tropes. The healing food items that are shaped like mini Marvel puns (shoutout to the bejewelled ice cream on Thanos' ship that made me laugh out loud when I put 'Infinity Cone' together). How each and every character has several swap-specific voice lines depending on which hero they are subbing out for — something the game's narrative designer, Yannick Belzil, said took up a good two weeks of writing when I <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/oh-st-thats-a-great-idea-why-didnt-we-think-of-that-before-marvel-cosmic-invasion-devs-on-drafting-the-ultimate-team">spoke to him</a> last month.</p>
<p>On the surface, the game is a neat throwback beat 'em up, but it's packed with so much love for the source material, so many deep cuts, that I was in a perpetual state of pointing at the screen like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton">that one Leonardo DiCaprio meme</a>. Come on, show me a comic book fan who <em>doesn't</em> relish the smug kick of clocking a reference that they feel was written just for them.</p>
<p>2026 has quite the follow-up to pull off, and it's bringing out the big guns to do so. We've got <strong>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</strong>, <strong>Avengers: Doomsday</strong>, <strong>Supergirl</strong> and <strong>Clayface</strong> on the big screen; <strong>Lanterns</strong>, <strong>Wonder Man</strong>, <strong>VisionQuest</strong>, and more Daredevil and animated Spidey on the small. Insomniac's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_wolverine">Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tokon</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch will keep the gaming side of things ticking over (plus <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_1943_rise_of_hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, <em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-piles-on-ps5-delay-misery">hopefully</a></em>), and that's just the <em>confirmed</em> projects.</p>
<p>In previous years, such a packed line-up of superhero screenings would send a shiver down my spine — that's a lot of homework — but after the joys of 2025, I'm ready to strap on my web-shooters and proudly declare myself a True Believer once again.</p>
