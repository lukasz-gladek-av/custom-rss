            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashly-burch-concerns-ai-aloy-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy’s actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn’t reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it’s still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character – and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We’ve been here before – a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‘theft’</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‘I Feel Worried About This Art Form’</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‘protections’ against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors – and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone’s voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We’ve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves – even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‘AI is coming for all of us.’</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‘going out of their way’ to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‘malicious purposes of causing further harm’ to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations … purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that’s probably why I’m not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they’re still ‘mischaracterising’ him, and he’s seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>

            <p>
I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to  admit that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad that like many games before it, it's copying Breath of the Wild's climbing so you can scale pretty much any clifface. Once you're up there you can do the video game staple that is scanning your environment to reveal the nearby area on your map, which will highlight shipwrecks or abandoned testing stations. You know, the Ubisoft effect. What actually makes that kind of interesting are the coriolis storms.

Most of the times storms in video games are just about blocking your vision, preventing you from going somewhere, maybe making it harder for you to be seen by enemies and vice versa, but Dune: Awakening's coriolis storms change the entire map every single week. Being an online survival game, obviously this is something to keep players coming back so that it feels fresh week to week, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> can execute it well it could make for an interesting time, the headaches for cartographers aside.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to jump into the game, you can't quite do that yet because it's not out until May 20th. However! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-time-to-create-a-character-and-benchmark-a-sandworm-in-dune-awakening-assuming-youre-buying-it-in-may">You can already make your character ahead of its release</a>, so you've got plenty of time to make a cooler, more sci-fiy version of yourself, or some nightmarish creation you post on social media for 11 likes.

            <p>
Remember when Nvidia announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> RTX mod way back in, crikey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-rtx-mod-brings-ray-tracing-and-dlss-to-another-valve-classic">2023</a>? Yeah, I didn't realise how long it had been either. To be perfectly honest I thought it had already come out, but apparently not, because just this week Nvidia shared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-rtx">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> is getting a demo next week on March 18th. No, the full mod still doesn't have a release date, but when do any game projects ever release quickly after they were announced?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo will specifically let you play through the Ravenholm and Nova <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prospekt">Prospekt</a> levels, and a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">really long blog post from Nvidia</a> has desperately tried to make it clear all of the ways this mod supposedly makes the original game look better. Apparently "every aspect of each level has been upgraded" and everything from weapons, to enemies, to skyboxes have all been remade.
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Half-Life 2 RTX | Demo with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 4 Announce" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j31ISEd8xRM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Nvidia's blog post lets you do that thing where you can slide an image back and forth to see what it looks like with RTX on and off, and to be perfectly honest, most of the time it doesn't look better, it just looks foggier. The original game still looks incredible to this day if you ask me, there's a reason so many people still love it. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, most people aren't going to be able to play the dang thing anyway - the post notes that to "play at the level of detail shown in the screenshots and videos seen in this article, we recommend a GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card," even if there are ways to supposedly "ensure a great experience on previous-generation GPUs, too." I don't think I want to turn my PC into a jet engine for a 20 year old game, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
The base version of Half-Life 2 actually got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">pretty nice update</a> last November for its 20th anniversary, which folded Episodes One and Two into the main package, and even fixed some old bugs. Cheers for that again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a>.

            <p>
A new week, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update, and a pretty hefty one has arrived at that. Before we get on to some of the more notable changes, over on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian's</a> forum pages where you can read the <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/">full patch notes</a>, the developer shared that in the coming weeks it plans to release a roadmap that will "go over some of the plans we have that will be coming to the game over the upcoming year." Whether that be DLC, free content, or just some planned gameplay changes, I couldn't tell you, your guess is as good as mine.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right, about those various updates. Firstly, there's a number of community requested features that have been added in and/ or tweaked, like your player character getting an additional talent point at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Any of you with save files past any of those levels will find that they have those additional points now. Those of you on PC playing with a mouse and keyboard have the option to toggle between walking and running now too.
</p>
<p>
A nice accessibility feature has been added in too, you can now increase the font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab. The photographers amongst you will be pleased to hear that you can now keybind the option to toggle your HUD on and off for cleaner screenshots, or reduce the HUD's opacity if you like your health bar being transparent for some reason.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, camera-wise an FOV slider has been added for playing in third-person, and you can lock the compass to always point north instead of rotating inputs. All of you controller players can completely customise your button inputs now too. There's a whole laundry list of other fixes, tweaks, and improvements that I won't bore you with here, but it certainly looks like it'll make for a smoother experience overall. Happy Avowing! Or whatever it is you do, I haven't played it yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-assassins-creed-2-and-3-had-the-best-writing-the-series-has-ever-seen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most memorable moments in the entire Assassin’s Creed series happens near the start of Assassin’s Creed 3, when Haytham Kenway has finished rounding up his band of assassins in the New World. Or at least, the player is led to believe they’re assassins. Haytham, after all, uses a hidden blade, is just as charismatic as previous series protagonist Ezio Auditore, and has – up until this point in the campaign – played the part of a hero, busting Native Americans out of prison and beating up cocky British redcoats. Only when he utters the familiar phrase, “May the Father of Understanding guide us,” does it become clear we have actually been following our sworn enemies, the Templars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To me, this surprising setup represents the fullest realization of Assassin’s Creed’s potential. The first game in the series introduced an intriguing concept – find, get to know, and kill your targets – but fell short in the story department, with both protagonist Altaïr and his victims being utterly bereft of personality. Assassin’s Creed 2 took a step in the right direction by replacing Altaïr with the more iconic Ezio, but failed to apply the same treatment to his adversaries, with the big bad of its spinoff Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Cesare Borgia, coming across as particularly underdeveloped. Only in Assassin’s Creed 3, set during the American Revolution, did the developers at Ubisoft devote as much time to fleshing out the hunted as they did the hunter. It lent the game an organic flow from set-up to payoff and, as a result, achieved a delicate balance between gameplay and narrative that as yet hasn’t been replicated since.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/ac-3-writing-1741616500293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The underappreciated AC3 features the series' best balance of gameplay and story. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the current RPG era of the series has largely been well received by players and critics, a wealth of articles, YouTube videos, and forum posts agree that Assassin’s Creed is in decline, and has been for some time. What exactly is responsible for this downfall, however, is subject to debate. Some point to the increasingly unrealistic premises of the modern games, which have you face off against gods like Anubis and Fenrir. Others take issue with Ubisoft’s implementation of a varied spectrum of romance options or, in the hotly-disputed case of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, replacing its hitherto fictional protagonists with a real-world historical figure, an African samurai called Yasuke. My personal nostalgia for the Xbox 360/PS3-era games notwithstanding, I’d argue it’s none of these. Instead, such decline is a result of the series’ gradual abandonment of character-driven storytelling, which has by now gotten buried deep inside its sprawling sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, Assassin’s Creed has padded its original action-adventure formula with a slew of RPG and live service-ish elements, from dialogue trees and XP-based levelling systems to loot boxes, microtransaction DLC, and gear customization. But the bigger the new installments have become, the emptier they have started to feel, and not just with regard to the countless climb-this-tower, find-that-object side-missions, but also their basic storytelling. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although allowing you to choose what your character says or does should theoretically make the overall experience more immersive, in practice I’ve found it often has the opposite effect: as scripts get longer and longer to account for multiple possible scenarios, they feel like they lack the same level of polish as a game with a more limited range of interaction. The focused, screenplay-like scripts of the series’ action-adventure era allowed for sharply defined characters that were not pulled thin by a game structure that demands its protagonist be compassionate or brutal on the whim of the player.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, while a game like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey technically has more content than Assassin’s Creed 2, much of it feels wooden and underbaked. This unfortunately breaks the immersion; it's too often very obvious that you are interacting with computer generated characters rather than complex historical figures. This is in stark contrast to the franchise’s Xbox 360/PS3 era, which in my humble opinion has produced some of the finest writing in all of gaming, from Ezio’s fiery “Do not follow me, or anyone else!” speech after besting Savonarola, to the tragicomic soliloquy Haytham delivers when he is at long last killed by his son, Connor: </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Don't think I have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying I was wrong. I will not weep and wonder what might have been. I'm sure you understand. Still, I'm proud of you in a way. You have shown great conviction. Strength. Courage. All noble qualities. I should have killed you long ago.”</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/ac-3-haytham-kenway-writing-1741616625131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Haytham Kenway is one of Assassin's Creed's most richly-realized villains. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The writing has suffered in other ways over the years, too. Where the modern games tend to stick to the easily digestible dichotomy of Assassins = good and Templars = bad, the earlier games went to great lengths to show that the line between the two orders isn’t as clear-cut as it initially appears. In Assassin’s Creed 3, each defeated Templar uses their last breath to make Connor – and, by extension, the player – question their own beliefs. William Johnson, a negotiator, says the Templars could have stopped the Native American genocide. Thomas Hickey, a hedonist, calls the Assassins’ mission unrealistic and promises Connor that he’ll never feel fulfilled. Benjamin Church, who betrays Haytham, declares it’s “all a matter of perspective,” and that the British – from their point of view – see themselves as the victims, not the aggressors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haytham, for his part, tries to shake Connor’s faith in George Washington, claiming the country he’ll create will be no less despotic than the monarchy from which the Americans sought to liberate themselves – an assertion which rings all the more true when we discover that the command to burn down Connor’s village wasn’t given by Haytham’s henchman Charles Lee, as previously thought, but Washington. By the end of the game, the player has more questions than answers – and the story is stronger for it.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking back on the franchise’s long history, there is a reason why one track from the Jesper Kyd-composed Assassin’s Creed 2 score, “Ezio’s Family,” resonated with players to the point of becoming the series’ official theme. The PS3 games, particularly Assassin’s Creed 2 and Assassin’s Creed 3, were – at their core – character-driven experiences; the melancholic guitar strings of “Ezio’s Family” weren’t meant to evoke the game’s Renaissance setting so much as Ezio’s personal trauma of losing his family. As much as I admire the expansive worldbuilding and graphical fidelity of the current generation of Assassin’s Creed games, my hope is that this out-of-control franchise will someday scale itself down, and once again deliver the kind of focused, tailor-made stories that made me fall in love with it in the first place. Sadly, in a landscape dominated by sprawling sandboxes and single-player games with live service-style ambitions, I fear that’s just not “good business” anymore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <p>
People love to go on and on about how good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2's</a> campaign mode is, and they'd be right to do so, but really we all know there's one specific level we have in mind when it comes to the sidelined shooter: the time travel one. I don't care for shooters all that much, online or offline ones, yet I still gave a go because the time travel level really appealed to me mechanically. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored 2's</a> similarly structured time travel section wooed me similarly, so I was very pleased to discover the newest trailer for Tenet of the Spark this week, an action-adventure game that is basically Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2's time travel levels made into an entire game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Tenet of the Spark has a few things that sets itself differently from said two levels. In the first instance, it's pretty much all melee combat. Punchin', hammerin', knife throwin', that sort of thing. Where the time travel element is most notably different is that you can travel between three time periods: modern day, the Viking age, and the Aztec era. The thing that I'm finding most fun from the game's trailer, as you can see above, is that the level design is more or less the same across all three time periods, with the set dressing being the big thing to change.
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
Enemies themselves stay in the same spots throughout the three periods too, with each setting looking to have its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the Viking setting, you can throw or push objects, and you've got a big ole hammer you can smack things with, whereas in the Aztec period you've got a knife you can chuck at baddies for some long-distance options.
</p>
<p>
It's neat! And stylish as all hell too, I love the effect of the environment changing between time periods, everything shifts and pops a little bit, it's not just swapping you from one scene to the next. The game has been in the works for a little while now, but doesn't have a release date just yet. If it takes your fancy, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2565010/Tenet_of_the_Spark/">wishlist it here</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, you might have seen the abomination that was an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leaked-video-shows-playstation-toying-with-aloy-from-horizon-as-an-ai-chatbot">AI-powered version of Horizon series protagonist Aloy</a>. It came as part of a leak that showed Sony experimenting with the ability to chat to video game characters that use OpenAI and Chat-GPT to respond, though Sony quickly saw to scrubbing any evidence of footage using the power of copyright laws. Notably the voice behind this AI version of Aloy was not that of her voice actor's, Ashly Burch, but the voice actor has offered up her own thoughts on the whole situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Quite quickly in the video Burch shared to TikTok, she explained that developer Guerilla had contacted her to claim that the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development", and importantly didn't use any of her vocal or facial performance. Even with that, Burch did still say she feels "worried", not about "Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form."
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
As Burch points out, The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a>) is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">currently on strike</a>, specifically because of concerns over AI being used to replace actors in the game development process, and that they're asking for protections from its usage. This includes very reasonable things like requiring consent before making an AI version of the actor in question, fair compensation, and to be informed of how the AI dub is being used.
</p>
<p>
For Burch, her concern is a video like this coming out that is based on someone's performance, and "the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn't have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."
</p>
<p>
The leaked video is just a tech demo, it's not something we'll necessarily see implemented in any games or for other purposes, but personally I hope it stays as buried as Sony's lawyers are trying to make the footage. Fingers crossed SAG-AFTRA gets their needs met.

			<p>According to a new analysis shared online today, the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination in the recently released Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is likely a preview of the Grand Theft Auto VI features.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released earlier today their analysis of the new version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games released on PC this month, providing a good look at the new features and how they compare with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game. The feature that sets the new PC version of the game apart from every other is the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination, which, by itself, suggests that this tech is being developed for Grand Theft Auto VI and has been backported to its predecessor. Usually, when a developer implements platform-exclusive ray tracing features, it does so in a limited fashion, as highlighted by games like Dying Light 2, where RTGI works only for the sun, or in The Witcher 3, where RTGI does not work on a per-pixel basis but only applies to the world with probes, causing visual artifacts.</p>
<p>In Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, on the other hand, RTGI not only works on a per-pixel basis, but it also features stable and coherent bounce lighting from any random light, which is not easy to implement and requires a lot of work. The same tech, in addition to emitting materials, is featured prominently in the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, further suggesting that the Enhanced Edition new features are a preview of the tech that will be featured in the next entry in the series launching later this year.</p>
<p>If the same Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition RTGI tech will be featured in the next entry in the series, Digital Foundry believes how the Enhanced Edition runs could be indicative of the performance that should be expected on base consoles for the sequel. While the tech is cleverly optimized and is not particularly heavy on the GPU, it is heavy on the CPU, and a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, a CPU comparable to that of the base current generation consoles, cannot run the game at a steady 60 FPS at 1440p resolution and NVIDIA DLSS at Quality mode. This, in addition to the reveal trailer running at 30 FPS, further suggests that Grand Theft Auto VI will be limited to 30 FPS on base consoles, as many believe it will.</p>

<p>Ray-traced global illumination is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features</a> introduced in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-record-broke-again/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike 2 keeps breaking the all-time high record for peak concurrent players on Steam. It seems as though a new record is being set every week at this point, and the latest figure is a <strong>doozy</strong>. Hours ago, the game hit 1.82 million peak players, which represents solid growth since the last time the record was broken with 1.74 million peak players.</p>



<p>As I write this, 1.5 million people around the world are playing Counter-Strike 2. The next top title on Steam is PUBG, the free-to-play battle royale game, which has 659,000 people playing.</p>



<p>Nothing comes close to Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-are-again">Here We Are Again</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has secured another peak player record, and at this point, it’s becoming <strong>at least </strong>a monthly affair. More people are playing Counter-Strike than ever before, and it never leaves the top spot on Steam unless something remarkable hits the market, like Palworld.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is also the most popular game on Twitch by a mile, boasting 381,000 concurrent viewers at the time of writing. In second place is Just Chatting, with 316,000 viewers – the next top <strong>game </strong>on Twitch is Dota 2, with 183,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It helps that Counter-Strike 2 has a phenomenally popular esports scene, and that’s where much of the viewership and player count records come from. Most of the top channels on Twitch broadcasting Counter-Strike 2 are co-streaming the ESL Pro League, which is unfolding as you read this.</p>

            <p>Actress Ashly Burch has responded to the leaked AI Aloy footage, which made the rounds earlier this week.</p>
<p>The footage in question showed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">Sony employee engaging with an on-screen AI version of the Horizon lead</a>. The employee asked the AI Aloy a number of questions, such as "how are you", to which the character replied she was ok, but "dealing with a sore throat", before she shared some Horizon lore.</p>
<p>Now, Burch - who along with starring as Horizon's Aloy has featured in a series such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>, Borderlands and The Last of Us - has shared her thoughts on the leaked footage.</p>

<p>"I saw the tech demo earlier this week," Burch said in a video shared on her social channels, adding Horizon developer Guerrilla had been in contact with her to say the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sony "didn't use any of [Burch's] performance" for the demo. "So none of my facial or voice data," Aloy's actress said. "Guerrilla owns Aloy as a character."</p>
<p>But still, "I feel worried," Burch continued. "Not worried about Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form.</p>
<p>"Game performance as an art form."</p>
<p>Burch went on to speak about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">current SAG-AFTRA strikes</a>, of which AI is a big part of the discussion. "We're asking for protections," Burch said. "What we are fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you're using this AI double."</p>
<p>Burch added she doesn't feel worried because the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, reasoning "of course they do - they always want to use technological advancements". </p>
<p>
"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," the actress said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back. </p>
<p>"And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p>

<p>Burch stated she loves this industry and the creative art form. She wants there "to be a new generation of actors", and for there to be "so many more incredible game performances" from those actors.</p>
<p>"I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don't win, then that future is really compromised," Burch said. "I'm genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerrilla, because again, I don't think... the technology isn't the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn't the problem. The problem is we are currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections."</p>
<p>Burch closed by stating she supports the strike, and always has. "Fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/627954/star-of-providence-review-nintendo-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Star of Providence</em> is like a retro game I would have loved as a kid. But the roguelike bullet hell shooter is also a modern twin-stick shooter, and the melding of the two eras results in a fun, fast, and challenging experience.</p><p>In <em>Star</em>, you control a ship and explore randomly generated dungeons. As you navigate room by room — similar to an old-school <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game — you’ll pick up powerful weapons to fight the many enemies you’ll stumble across in your dungeon crawling.</p><p>The weapons are a delight, filling your screen with bullets and lasers. Sometimes, you’ll get cool effects like the ability for your bullets to phase through one side of the screen and appear on the other. But enemies can also spew out huge amounts of bullets, and that means many rooms turn into chaos as you weave through attack patterns to line up a perfect shot. The game’s narrow aspect ratio makes rooms feel pretty small, too (though I appreciate how it adds to the retro vibe).</p><p><em>Star’s</em> controls are tight, so it always feels like you can thread the needle to escape danger. A useful dash can get you out of rough spots. And you can deploy bombs to clear bullets from a room, but they can take a while to recharge.</p><p>As you explore dungeons, you’ll have to make a lot of typical roguelike-y choices, like what to buy at a shop or what upgrades to pick. Arguably the most important choice is what weapons you’ll pick up along the way: they’re much more powerful than your basic gun, but they also have a limited amount of ammo. But I found that made for some fun strategy. Do I buy a weapon right when I come upon a store but risk running out of ammo before I really need it? Or should I try to survive a floor without it and instead buy the weapon when I’m about to take on the floor’s boss?</p><p>Speaking of bosses: they’re awesome. They’re typically giant, taking up a good portion of the square screen, and they spew bullets in all sorts of unpredictable and nail-biting patterns. I’m a particularly big fan of the <a href="https://starofprovidence.wiki.gg/wiki/Daemon">huge green skeleton with horns</a>.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite thing about <em>Star</em> is that everything is <em>fast</em>. Rooms typically take just seconds to clear, meaning you can zip through a whole dungeon floor in a few minutes. The game’s map lets you instantly teleport to rooms you’ve previously been to as you’re exploring a floor. Even boss fights usually only take a minute or two. And when you want to start a new run, all you need to do is go through a door at your home base.</p><p>There’s a constant sense of forward momentum that I think more games should emulate. That actually might be where <em>Star</em> is most like the old-school games it’s inspired by: jumping into the action is almost as easy as adding another quarter to an arcade machine.</p><p><sub>Star of Providence<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Developer Red Thread Games has announced its next game which is titled Hello Sunshine, and it looks like one inspiration could be The Iron Giant. The teaser shows you character, who is the last employee of the Hello Sunshine corporation, who is looking for something to quench their thirst. Unfortunately, the bottle they find is empty so they chuck it and, inadvertently, wake up a hostile robot. Luckily, a friendly robot comes in to save the day. A release date is yet to be confirmed, and Hello Sunshine seems to be PC only at the moment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hello Sunshine — official teaser trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XI-HO3uoCmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hello Sunshine is a survival RPG in which you and the robot are journeying along a road to reach the tower at the end of it. That tower holds the fate of the entire world. There is a day and night cycle in the game as well. In the day, the sun’s heat can be deadly so staying in the robots shadow gives some relief. During this time scavenging for supplies and looking for puzzle pieces is the key focus, while at night you will need to make camp while the robot recharges, crafting supplies and carrying out any repairs for the robot. You will be able to craft smaller robots to help with scavenging and other tasks. As an employee of Hello Sunshine you can complete tasks that improves your employee rank, which in turn unlocks bonuses such as vending machines and rest areas, which will be needed in this desert. Hello Sunshine will also feature co-op.</p>

The game is filled with surprisingly natural sounding conversations, whether they’re serious and detailed or funny and light. It’s very rare that I encounter characters that are so believable in a game. Quite the achievement considering one of those characters is a gruff, bearded New Yorker with dwarfism who heals people by reciting poetry, who I honestly wish I got to spend more time with.”</em></p>

<p>Ideally, you'd expect any Super NES console—if properly maintained—to operate identically to any other Super NES unit ever made (in the same region, at least). Given the same base ROM file and the same set of precisely timed inputs, all those consoles should hopefully give the same gameplay output across individual hardware and across time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tas.bot/wiki/Main_Page">TASBot community</a> relies on this kind of solid-state predictability when creating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/how-a-game-playing-robot-coded-super-mario-maker-onto-an-snes-live-on-stage/">tool-assisted speedruns</a> that can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/">executed</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/how-a-robot-got-super-mario-64-and-portal-running-on-an-snes/">robotic precision</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/how-to-beat-super-mario-bros-3-in-less-than-a-second/">actual console hardware</a>. But on the SNES in particular, the team has largely struggled to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/">emulated speedruns</a> to sync up with demonstrated results on real consoles.</p>
<p>After significant research and testing on dozens of actual SNES units, the TASBot team now thinks that a cheap ceramic resonator used in the system's Audio Processing Unit (APU) is to blame for much of this inconsistency. While <a href="https://snes.nesdev.org/wiki/SNES_Development_Manual">Nintendo's own documentation</a> says the APU should run at a consistent rate of 24.576 Mhz (and the associated Digital Signal Processor sample rate at a flat 32,000 Hz), in practice, that rate can vary just a bit based on heat, system age, and minor physical variations that develop in different console units over time.</p>
<p>Casual players would only notice this problem in the form of an almost imperceptibly higher pitch for in-game music and sounds. But for TASBot, Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil says this unreliable clock has become a "constant, pervasive, unavoidable" problem for getting frame-accurate consistency in hardware-verified speedruns.</p>

<p>Cecil says he first began to suspect the APU's role in TASBot's SNES problems back in 2016 when he broke open his own console to test it with an external frequency counter. He <a href="https://tasvideos.org/Forum/Topics/17018?CurrentPage=4&amp;Highlight=444216#444216">found</a> that his APU clock had "degraded substantially enough to cause problems with repeatability," causing the console to throw out unpredictable "lag frames" if and when the CPU and APU load cycles failed to line up in the expected manner. Those lag frames, in turn, are enough to "desynchronize" TASBot's input on actual hardware from the results you'd see on a more controlled emulator.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Unlike the quartz crystals used in many electronics (including the SNES's more consistent and differently timed CPU), the cheaper ceramic resonators in the SNES APU are "known to degrade over time," as Cecil put it. <a href="https://www.symmetryelectronics.com/getmedia/921363e7-f4b0-4839-ab33-e8e6365a248a/ceramics_resonators_app_manual.pdf">Documentation for the resonators used in the APU</a>&nbsp;also seems to suggest that excess heat may impact the clock cycle speed, meaning the APU might speed up a bit as a specific console heats up.</p>

<p>The TASBot team was not the first group to notice this kind of audio inconsistency in the SNES. In the early 2000s, some emulator developers <a href="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=52693#Post52693">found</a> that certain late-era SNES games don't run correctly when the emulator's Digital Signal Processor (DSP) sample rate is set to the Nintendo-specified value of precisely 32,000 Hz (a number derived from the speed of the APU clock). Developers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030914232710/https://alpha-ii.com/Info/snes-spdif.html">tested actual hardware</a> at the time and found that the DSP was actually running at 32,040 Hz and that setting the emulated DSP to run at that specific rate suddenly fixed the misbehaving commercial games.</p>
<p>That small but necessary emulator tweak implies that "the original developers who wrote those games were using hardware that... must have been running slightly faster at that point," Cecil told Ars. "Because if they had written directly to what the spec said, it may not have worked."</p>

<h2>Survey says...</h2>
<p>While research and testing confirmed the existence of these APU variations, Cecil wanted to determine just how big the problem was across actual consoles today. To do that, he <a href="https://nextcloud.tas.bot/index.php/apps/forms/s/TJDiEwP6J7HFfYbPRw4A7dHN">ran an informal online survey</a> last month, cryptically <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3lj47u3fga22n">warning his social media followers</a> that "SNES consoles seem to be getting faster as they age." He asked respondents to <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24610">run a DSP clock measurement ROM</a> on any working SNES hardware they had lying around and to rerun the test after the console had time to warm up.</p>
<p>After receiving 143 responses and <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/fpwWkqDcnxXR/SNES-SMP-speed/p/1">crunching the numbers</a>, Cecil said he was surprised to find that temperature seemed to have a minimal impact on measured DSP speed; the measurement only rose an insignificant 8 Hz on average between "cold" and "warm" readings on the same console. Cecil even put his own console in a freezer to see if the DSP clock rate would change as it thawed out and found only a 32 Hz difference as it warmed back up to room temperature.</p>

<p>Those heat effects paled in comparison to the natural clock variation across different consoles, though. The slowest and fastest DSPs in Cecil's sample showed a clock difference of 234 Hz, or about 0.7 percent of the 32,000 Hz specification.</p>
<p>That difference is small enough that human players probably wouldn't notice it directly; TASBot team member Total estimated it might amount to "at most maybe a second or two [of difference] over hours of gameplay." Skilled speedrunners could notice small differences, though, if differing CPU and APU alignments cause "carefully memorized enemy pattern changes to something else" between runs, Cecil said.</p>
<p>For a frame-perfect tool-assisted speedrun, though, the clock variations between consoles could cause innumerable headaches. As TASBot team member Undisbeliever <a href="https://undisbeliever.net/blog/20250313-smpspeed.html">explained in his detailed analysis</a>: "On one console this might take 0.126 frames to process the music-tick, on a different console it might take 0.127 frames. It might not seem like much but it is enough to potentially delay the start of song loading by 1 frame (depending on timing, lag and game-code)."</p>

              Cecil's survey found variation across consoles was much higher than the effects of heat on any single console.

<p>Cecil also said the survey-reported DSP clock speeds were also a bit higher than he expected, at an average rate of 32,076 Hz at room temperature. That's quite a bit higher than both the 32,000 Hz spec set by Nintendo and the 32,040 Hz rate that emulator developers settled on after sampling actual hardware in 2003.</p>
<p>To some observers, this is evidence that SNES APUs originally produced in the '90s have been speeding up slightly as they age and could continue to get faster in the coming years and decades. But Cecil says the historical data they have is too circumstantial to make such a claim for certain.</p>
<p>"We're all a bunch of differently skilled geeks and nerds, and it's in our nature to argue over what the results mean, which is fine," Cecil said. "The only thing we can say with certainty is the statistical significance of the responses that show the current average DSP sample rate is 32,076 Hz, faster on average than the original specification. The rest of it is up to interpretation and a certain amount of educated guessing based on what we can glean."</p>

<h2>A first step</h2>
<p>For the TASBot team, knowing just how much real SNES hardware timing can differ from dry specifications (and emulators) is an important step to getting more consistent results on real hardware. But that knowledge hasn't completely solved their synchronization problems. Even when Cecil replaced the ceramic APU resonator in his Super NES with a more accurate quartz version (tuned precisely to match Nintendo's written specification), the team "did not see perfect behavior like we expected," he told Ars.</p>
<p>Beyond clock speed inconsistencies, Cecil explained to Ars that TASBot team testing has found an additional "jitter pattern" present in the APU sampling that "injects some variance in how long it takes to perform various actions" between runs. That leads to non-deterministic performance even on the same hardware, Cecil said, which means that "TASBot is likely to desync" after just a few minutes of play on most SNES games.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rasteri/TAStable">Extensive research from Rasteri</a> suggests that these inconsistencies across same-console runs are likely caused by a "very non-deterministic reset circuit" that changes the specific startup order and timing for a console's individual components every time it's powered on. That leads to essentially "infinite possibilities" for the relative place where the CPU and APU clocks start in their "synchronization cycle" for each fresh run, making it impossible to predict specifically where and when lag frames will appear, Rasteri wrote.</p>
<p>Cecil said these kind of "butterfly effect" timing issues make the Super NES "a surprisingly complicated console [that has] resisted our attempts to fully model it and coerce it into behaving consistently." But he's still hopeful that the team will "eventually find a way to restore an SNES to the behavior game developers expected based on the documentation they were provided without making invasive changes..."</p>
<p>In the end, though, Cecil <a href="https://bishopfox.com/blog/youre-doing-iot-rng">seems to have developed an almost grudging respect</a> for how the SNES's odd architecture leads to such unpredictable operation in practice. "If you want to deliberately create a source of randomness and non-deterministic behavior, having two clock sources that spinloop independently against one another is a fantastic choice," he said.</p>
