              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, it seems like the mystery of the Game Awards statue may have been solved. Furthermore, if true, it comes from a studio fresh off huge wins at the event.</p>



<p>Since last month, a weird statue in the middle of New Mexico has appeared out of nowhere. Both The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley hinted at its true nature, but fans have been going berserk figuring out what it means. From God of War and Diablo to Saros and The Elder Scrolls, guesses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been all over the place</a>. Some theories had some real weight to them, though many were shut down by industry figures like Jason Schreier and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-director-reveals-if-the-game-awards-2025-statue-has-anything-to-do-with-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Barlog</a>. However, a new trademark for a legendary RPG series has been spotted, with the designs matching the statue perfectly.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-divinity-game-possibly-being-revealed-at-the-game-awards-via-mystery-statue-new-report-details">New Divinity Game Possibly Being Revealed at The Game Awards via Mystery Statue, New Report Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report first came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who previously did pieces on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband</a>. In it, the outlet found trademarks for a new Divinity game, directed by Baldur’s Gate 3’s Larian Studios. From the looks of it, the logo and accompanying images look strikingly similar to those of the statue. The picture of the listings, as well as the statue for reference, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0BhWOdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that the connection has not been confirmed by Larian or The Game Awards, so take it with a grain of salt. In any case, a new Divinity is something many fans will be pumped about. The last release, Divinity: Original Sin 2, came out in 2017 for last-gen consoles. The acclaimed RPG series took players to a new medieval fantasy world with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective. While the logo and all do look new, it could be a remaster of sorts for newer consoles. Still, Larian Studios has been on a roll after the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-bafta-games-awards/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, so, needless to say, if true, it’s one to keep a giant glowing eye on.</p>

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far.</p><h2 id="Cold_Snap_release_date">Cold Snap release date</h2><p>Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players.</p><p>The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew.</p><h2 id="Snowfall_map_condition">Snowfall map condition</h2><p>The Cold Snap update will feature the new snowfall map condition. While we don't know everything this condition will entail, we do know that heavy snow will reduce visibility and muffle sound, which should force players to engage in close-quarters combat--or tuck tail and run in another direction. Choosing the latter, though, may open you up to ambushes, as players will leave footprints in the snow that allow other raiders to track you more easily.</p><p>As with other map conditions, snowfall will rotate across a few of the game's existing maps and almost certainly increase loot value as an incentive for visiting and exploring the hazards within. Embark hasn't specified which maps will receive this condition yet, but based on layouts and existing map condition rotations, our best guess is Buried City and Blue Gate.</p><div tabindex="0"

Similar to North Line's Breaking New Ground update, players will be tasked with contributing resources or completing tasks during raids to work toward a series of rewards.

This one is expected to be a premium deck, meaning you'll likely need to purchase it with real money before you can access all its content. However, we assume that the game's existing Creds currency will be used to buy each item in-game after you've unlocked the premium access, but we'll certainly update you when we know for sure.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">Arc Raiders guide hub</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Geoff Keighley Talks Game Awards: ‘Lots Of Games Get Sold’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-game-awards-sales-balatro-clair-obscur-2000651728</link>
            <guid>1377568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Game Awards just keeps getting bigger and bigger. While viewers sometimes complain about the marathon runtime and nitpick every game announcement trailer they don’t care about, Geoff Keighley’s year-end showcase has become the closest thing we still have to an old-school E3 marketing extravaganza. In the face of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">annual criticism</a> about not putting the focus exclusively on the awards part of the ceremony, the host recently explained why his show is as much about recognizing art as it is about revealing big game announcements.</p> <p>“There are many different constituents that tune in,” Keighley told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><em>The Game Business</em></a> (a newsletter he cofounded with author Chris Dring) in a new interview. “And it is a balancing act. You correctly pointed out that there’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</p>

 <p>He described a virtuous cycle in which more viewership means more attention for the games being celebrated, big and small, which can in turn lead to more sales for the companies or indie teams behind them.</p> <p>“My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show,” he said. “And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they’re seen by a lot of people. Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. <em>Balatro</em> had a huge boost. So hopefully it’s a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don’t always get it right.”</p>

 <p><em>Balatro</em> was already a big sensation in the gaming world by the time The Game Awards 2024 aired, but its prizes that night <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617">helped catapult it to even bigger success</a> in the months that followed, aided in part by a popular mobile port. All of a sudden games that were big among a hardcore group are exposed to a much wider audience.</p>

 <p>Even just getting nominated can help raise visibility in that way. Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliott <a href="https://substack.com/@superhys/p-181156422">recently shared</a> the estimated sales boosts that the Game Awards’ Game of the Year contenders have received over the past few weeks. While the effect was biggest for frontrunner <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, the most nominated game in TGAs history, nominees like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> were also projected to have sold an additional 100,000 copies during the period.</p> <p>Elliott says holiday sales are also a big factor in that. That’s probably why any Game Awards winners cut their price directly after the event to take advantage of the brief spotlight.</p>

<p>Everyone is obsessed with ‘wrapping up’ more than just presents now as the Holiday season approaches. Xbox Wrapped 2025 is the best way to see how much time you’ve spent on your Xbox, what you’ve done on it, and accessing Xbox Wrapped is nice and easy.</p>



<p>The Xbox brand probably hasn’t had the hottest 2025, and the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price increase</a> probably wasn’t the best of news. Despite these setbacks, there’s still a more than healthy player base on Xbox, and this is why Xbox Wrapped’s Year in Review could unearth some fascinating stats about your playtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-year-in-review-2025-expected-release-date">Xbox Year in Review 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New year, new stats. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You should expect the Xbox Year in Review 2025 to arrive during the week of December 8, as this lines up with the last couple of editions of Xbox Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other ‘Wrapped’ round-ups, the biggest consistency about Xbox’s Year in Review is the inconsistency. Looking back at previous releases, you can see that the Xbox Year in Review 2023 was <strong>Tuesday, December 12</strong>, and last year it was <strong>Wednesday, December 4</strong>.</p>



<p>You could guesstimate that it’ll be Wednesday, December 10, for the 2025 edition of the round-up. If it’s not the first week of December, then it has to be the second. We’ve already passed Tuesday, leaving a reasonable assumption of Wednesday, December 10.</p>



<p>Note: Insider Gaming is not claiming this is the date, but is assuming a logical conclusion. Stay tuned and keep checking back for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Once the official Xbox Wrapped 2025 notice is up, there should be an easy-to-access link where you sign in and claim your full Xbox Year in Review 2025 analysis.</strong></p>



<p>This is based on the last couple of years, but it’s hard to imagine the process changing too much. Here’s how you potentially check your Xbox stats in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/YearinReview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Year in Review</a> site.</li>



<li>Log in to your Xbox account.</li>



<li>This should automatically trigger your custom Xbox Wrapped journey.</li>



<li>You can read and share details of your Xbox gaming in 2025.</li>
</ol>



<p>You only have a limited time to check the review once it’s live. Make sure you do so, and take a screenshot or share the link to keep the stats as memories or future comparisons!</p>



<p>Share your results once the Xbox Year in Review 2025 is live. Apart from social media, you’re encouraged to head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a> to discuss your stats with other Xbox users.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-director-bruce-straley-wildflower-interactive-the-game-awards/</link>
            <guid>1377559</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bruce Straley’s studio, Wildflower Interactive, will be revealing its debut game at The Game Awards. Straley’s resume includes creating The Last of Us and directing Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End for Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>The Game Awards are no strangers to The Last of Us. With the Naughty Dog IP winning multiple awards, including Game of the Year in 2020 for Part 2, it’s not surprising to see why. Last year, Naughty Dog even revealed its next project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, at the end of the show. However, one of The Last of Us’ co-creators, Bruce Straley, wasn’t there, having left the company in 2017. He started Wildflower Interactive in 2021, an indie studio, but didn’t give more information than that. Now, fans can expect to see what the studio has been working on come December 11th.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-game-from-wildflower-interactive-run-by-the-last-of-us-bruce-straley-to-premiere-at-the-game-awards-2025">New Game from Wildflower Interactive, Run by The Last of Us’ Bruce Straley, To Premiere at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998452590397501921?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, Game Awards host Geoff Keighley announced that <strong>the debut title from Wildflower Interactive will be revealed at the show</strong>. The video, only 30 seconds long, shows off the game’s cel-shaded style and a neat wilderness setting. In the back, some dialogue can be heard, including a bear-like roar and some reassurance. No details, like the title or release, have been revealed, though it’s likely to appear during the show on December 11th.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Bruce’s co-director on The Last of Us, Neil Druckmann, will likely be in attendance. The TV adaptation of The Last of Us’s second season is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Best Adaptation</a>, in which Neil helped direct. Bruce’s legacy at Naughty Dog goes beyond The Last of Us, as he directed Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End, which many claim to be the best in the series. Either way, an ambitious new project with a talented director at the helm is always something to look forward to.</p>

But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it.</p><p dir="ltr">When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Blizzard does have some concerns. Since it never intended houses to be seen from underneath, the bottom of houses don't have proper textures, so players may want to hide or obscure that part of their home. Having a house in the sky also makes it difficult to reach the front door, so Blizzard advised building a ramp, a mount landing pad, or a jumping puzzle to make the front door accessible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619841" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619841"></a><figcaption>An example of the flying houses players can create in WoW (source: WoWDB)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Being able to craft flying houses without fear of Blizzard bringing them back to the ground isn't the only good housing news. Blizzard also announced it increased the exterior-housing decor limit from 200 to 250 at housing level three.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the biggest pieces of feedback we've gotten over the past few weeks was that the exterior decor budget felt too restrictive," Jordan said. "This was intentionally set to 200 to address performance concerns. Now that we have some data from live servers to look at, we're happy to conclude that we can increase this limit by 25%."</p><p dir="ltr">The increased exterior decor limit should result in even more fantastical creations--something that is hardly in short supply. Housing in Blizzard's MMORPG has brought plenty of suprises, including news that the game may soon allow for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-be-getting-official-wedding-ceremonies/1100-6536700/" data-ref-id="1100-6536700">wedding ceremonies</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW player housing is currently in early access, with the full version of the feature set to arrive with the release of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight expansion in March 2026</a>.

                <p>While we're still a couple of months away from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem's</a> release, it looks like there could be a surprise return awaiting fans. Before it was removed, the PlayStation Store revealed new cover art for the game that featured longtime Resident Evil protagonist Leon Kennedy. PlayStation 5 players noticed the art on the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game.</p><p>IGN later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed the art</a>, which showed a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon hovering over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998365473516441707" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">High-res image of the official Leon S.

"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon--but just to make sure, these are all fake news," he told <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stevivor in an interview</a>, and added not to believe anything at face value.</p><p>So even though there was an attempt to keep Leon's involvement under wraps, Requiem still has plenty of surprises. Earlier this week, a GameStop listing mentioned another character who hasn't been officially revealed yet: <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gamestop-may-have-accidentally-leaked-a-second-playable-resident-evil-requiem-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosemary Winters</a>, who fans think will have a smaller role. It also looks like if she shows up, she'll still have both of her eyes.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

<p>Bethesda surprised us all today with the announcement that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> was heading to Switch 2 with a bunch of technical upgrades to boot. But with a game we've all seen <em>this many times</em>, would it really look all that different from the re-release we saw on Switch 1 back in 2022?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no longer, because Mr Alex Olney is here to reveal all! In the above video, we've got a side-by-side comparison of how Skyrim matches up on Switch 2 vs Switch 1, showcasing all the gameplay you could wish for.</p>
<p>As you'll see, there's certainly a bump on Switch 2, with the new release boasting "Enhanced resolution, improved load times, and optimised performance", but if you're expecting to see anything other than 'Skyrim, innit', think again.</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on the latest version of Skyrim on Switch 2 soon enough. Until then, you can check out the S2 version either via a free upgrade (if you already own the Anniversary Edition on Switch 1), as a standalone purchase for £52.99, or via the base-game-to-anniversary-edition upgrade for £17.99.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Multiplayer Game Reportedly Got 10x Fewer Players Than It Was Hoping For]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/king-meat-glowmade-layoffs-keighley-mrbeast-trailer-2000651722</link>
            <guid>1377514</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>King of Meat</em> developer Glowmade will layoff “around a dozen people” early next year, according to a new report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/">from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. These “voluntary redundancies” come just two months after the multiplayer party game hit Steam and after it reportedly failed to hit an ambitious 100,000 concurrent player target. <em>King of Meat</em> peaked at just 320 people on PC instead.</p> <p>Over the past few days, several Glowmade developers posted to LinkedIn that they’re looking for work. The U.K.-based studio published <em>King of Meat</em> in October, backed by Amazon Game Studio. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reported that discussions around the layoffs began earlier in December, and that leadership previously told staff the studio “had the runway to keep going.”</p>

 <p>Amazon Game Studios announced in 2021 that it was <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/amazon-games-publishing-original-game-from-glowmade">expanding its publishing efforts</a> with Glowmade, which was working on an “exciting new IP.”&nbsp;Glowmade had 25 staffers, according to a news release at the time.</p> <p>The studio’s leadership was reportedly hoping <em>King of Meat</em> would reach “a concurrent player count of at least 100,000,” but instead failed to maintain 1,000 players across platforms. On Steam, <em>King of Meat</em> had a recent 24-hour peak of 23 players; its top concurrent player number there is 320 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>

 <p>Most people probably only remember it as the game with the flashy trailer at Gamescom 2024 which featured an animated version of Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley. That memorable moment could have cost <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-trailers-steam-1851629266">close to half a million dollars</a>, but apparently didn’t do much to keep <em>King of Meat</em> bubbling around in the popular consciousness.</p> <p><em>King of Meat</em>‘s October release didn’t go well despite a huge marketing push, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRr0i2akDlk">including a big-budget MrBeast video</a>. The video, which included a whole dang set, more than a dozen content creators, and a $250,000 prize, is essentially a mini-<em>King of Meat</em> esports event. It was published just after <em>King of Meat</em>‘s release date and racked up 6.8 million views.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment.</p>

                <p>Yearly wraps have become an annual tradition across various platforms, and PlayStation is no exception. The <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Wrap website has gone live</a>, and once again, members of the PlayStation community can explore the total number of hours spent across single-player and multiplayer games. You'll have until January 8 to check out your stats--PlayStation Wrap-Up will continue to update until then--and users can redeem a unique glass-themed avatar once they complete their tour down memory lane.</p><p>This year's PlayStation Wrap-Up also includes a look at the number of games played on PS5 and PS4, a closer look at your gaming style, and even the DualSense controller you used the most. If you've used other PlayStation accessories, such as PlayStation VR2 or the PlayStation Portal handheld, those stats will also be included in your personal wrap-up. Additionally, you can get a brief look at how active you were on PlayStation Plus throughout the year, and Sony is also offering a curated list of recommended games to try out through the subscription service, if you're a member of the Premium or Extra tiers.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Blue Prince, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 were considerable timesinks, while other noteworthy releases included games like Ball x Pit, Elden Ring Nightreign, and Battlefield 6 kept players glued to their screens for many hours.</p><p>What will the 2026 edition of PlayStation Wrap-Up look like? While things can still change, some of the big upcoming releases include Resident Evil Requiem, 007: First Light, and Yakuza Kiwami 3. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/">if it doesn't suffer another delay</a>, we expect the November 2026 release of Grand Theft Auto 6 to rank high on next year's list of the top five most-played games.</p>

			<p>Imagine a world where music was outlawed, where anyone found making or listening to music is thrown in prison. That is the world of UNBEATABLE where a concert that summoned entities that were given the name The Silence led to a pretty sudden change in the law. Since that day, all musical expression, even singing in the shower or whistling while you work, is banned as it draws The Silence. Yet main character Beat is a musician who finds herself on a mission to fill the world with song once again.</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: FINAL TRAILER " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>UNBEATABLE has a great visual style, mixing anime stylised 2D characters in 3D locations. It is a striking visual which makes the characters standout in a pretty detailed world. Locations vary from a large house and its grounds to a few city streets that all have a distinct look, making it easy to get around. The art team have done a stellar job of meshing two distinct styles together that makes it seem natural for these 2D anime characters to be walking around normal looking 3D environments. UNBEATABLE has a colourful world, from characters to locations, and it adds to its distinctive style.</p>


<p>Beat is the main character that you control for much of the game, and she is joined by Quaver, Clef, and Treble on her adventure. Yes, every character is named after musical terminology. Personally, I disliked Beat’s personality, though the performance by the actors for all characters is decently done. UNBEATABLE’s story is one that has highs and lows to it, at some points it seemingly making big jumps accompanied by dialogue that wasn’t always good. I was also surprised at how long could pass between the rhythm battles with a lot of wandering and dialogue taking place between. The story mode lasts around eight hours, but it is not as fast paced as I thought it would be. UNBEATABLE’s story is probably the weakest offering in the whole package.</p>


<p>While the story is weak, the gameplay is where UNBEATABLE steps up. At its core, the game is a rhythm action game where things like combat and hitting balls at a batting cage are done to the beat of UNBEATABLE’s soundtrack. On normal difficulty, the combat scenarios only require a two button input which sounds simple but, as the action ramps up, so does the speed of the incoming prompts and does it test reaction skills. At no point did I find the timings off or unfair, with any failure down to my own misses or incorrect button presses.</p>
<p>What I also liked about the combat is that while you are pressing the buttons the characters are moving around the screen, which plays into which side the prompts are coming in from. In the story mode, outside of a few critical battles, you can lose fights and events will continue.</p>

<p>You can skip the story mode altogether if it is not for you, with UNBEATABLE also featuring an arcade mode. Think of this as a tracklist where you can unlock new songs to tackle with your rhythm matching skills. The combat is the same as in the story, but instead of spending a lot of time walking around between songs you just jump into the action. In arcade mode you can unlock and customise your scorecard with different titles, and challenge yourself to take on the songs at different difficulties.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a big part of UNBEATABLE, and while there’s a couple of songs that became earworms, with the rest not quite having the hook to be as catchy. Of course, song preferences are personal so others may find more songs they like than I did from the soundtrack.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		UNBEATABLE is a good rhythm action adventure game, with it highlights being its visual style and the arcade mode. The story is fine, but can feel all over the place at times with a script that isn’t the best, but the music through the game is good &nbsp;and there are a couple of standout tracks. It has been a while since a decent rhythm game came out, so it is worth giving UNBEATABLE a shot.	</p></div>

            <guid>1377478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery</a> to acquire the Streaming &amp; Studios division for $82.7 billion also included the WB Games division, with its studios, assets, and whatnot. However, the biggest VOD streaming media service didn't even mention it in the announcement or in the subsequent investor call.</p>



<p>That was already telling, but yesterday, Netflix executives finally commented on WB Games during the UBS Global Technology Conference. Answering a question, Netflix Co-CEO, President, and Director Gregory K. Peters clarified that the company didn't actually attribute any value to the gaming division during the deal because they're 'relatively minor'. </p>



<p><em>And maybe worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model, while they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things. Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts Legacy is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we believe that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.</em></p>



<p>Now, Peters also said that the addition of WB Games would accelerate the company's existing plans in the gaming space. However, it is clear that Netflix does not really believe WB Games to be a particularly significant asset, despite having recently produced a massive success like Hogwarts Legacy, which sold over 34 million units (as of March 2025) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a>, managing to beat even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and breaking a 14-year streak that either a Call of Duty game or a Rockstar game topped sales charts in the United States.</p>



<p>Granted, WB Games faced some hardships with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flop of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War), Player First Games (MultiVersus), and San Diego Studio, but there's still a lot of untapped potential there, especially after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a> that refocused the company on its four key IPs: DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat. It would perhaps warrant a little more consideration than what Netflix is giving them.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery deal is far from closed, anyway, especially after Paramount Skydance <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its hostile bid of $108.4 billion to get the entire company</a>, not just the Streaming &amp; Studios side. Unlike Netflix, Paramount, through Skydance, already owns several triple-A game development studios, such as Skydance Interactive, which has released several high-profile VR games, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-amy-hennig-new-studio-skydance-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skydance New Media</a>, Amy Hennig's studio working on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-once-again-now-arriving-mid-late-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed to the latter half of 2026</a>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-will-get-to-make-a-star-wars-game-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an untitled Star Wars game</a>. Netflix, on the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio last year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Downplays Value of WB Games, Calls Division “Minor” in Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/</link>
            <guid>1377472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 5, it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery had come to an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the business to the streaming giant. As part of that deal, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed that all</a> of Warner Bros. Games (WB Games) properties and studios would be owned by Netflix. </p>



<p>While Netflix didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment regarding what the future could hold for the gaming division of Warner Bros. On December 8, however, the first gaming-specific comments were made by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory Peters on the company’s pending purchase of WB Games.</p>







<p>Peters <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that when the deal</a> was coming together, WB Games wasn’t “built” into the deal model. He says that, despite their being “great studios and great folks working there”, they didn’t “attribute any value” to the games side of the company.</p>



<p><strong>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,”</strong> Peters said. </p>



<p><strong>“Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So, we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</strong></p>







<p>Should the Netflix deal for Warner Bros. close in 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">they’ll own studios</a> like Avalanche Software, Rocksteady Games, TT Games, and NetherRealm Studios. That means games like the aforementioned Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, the rumored in-development Batman game, and others will be under the Netflix umbrella.</p>



<p>To hear that they didn’t consider gaming when determining the value of the company might not be what fans want to hear. That said, it’s tough to know what the company really feels about the gaming side of things based on those comments alone.</p>



<p>The real showing will come after they official own all of the studios. Of course, that’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">if they close the</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">deal</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think will happen to WB Games if Netflix ends up owning the studios and games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Xbox's Jason Ronald has teased that Microsoft has "a lot of exciting things to share" in 2026 for the Xbox's 25th anniversary. Speaking to the <a href="https://youtu.be/6Wl8G4k6FoQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, Ronald was asked specifically if more Original Xbox games would be coming to Xbox Game Pass. Ronald didn't confirm anything outright but said fans have a lot to look forward to for the anniversary next year.</p><p>"I can't announce anything today, but 2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox.

<p>A shell of an upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Super Evil Megacorp has today announced that it will be launching an all-new Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for the TMNT roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</a>.</p>
<p>The new version launches on <strong>16th December</strong>, either as a standalone purchase or as a paid upgrade pack ($2.49, or your regional equivalent) for those who already own the base game, and it packs in everything you'd expect from a Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>The above trailer promises enhanced visuals and frame rate for smooth 4K 60fps play (resolution dropping to 1080p in handheld), and support for local GameShare and GameChat.</p>
<p>It appears that's <em>all</em> that's included in the Switch 2 upgrade at the time of writing — the trailer mentions both the Metalhead and Casey Jones DLC, though it is unclear whether they are included in the new package. We have reached out to Super Evil Megacorp, and will update this post when we hear back.</p>
<p>The performance boost will be a welcome addition. We had a good time with Splintered Fate when it launched on Switch 1 last year, though we noticed plenty of frame drops and experienced a few hard crashes. The game has seen several updates in the time since then, so perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will be the perfect opportunity to dive back in.</p>

              <p>The news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix is trying to buy Warner Bros.</a> didn’t ever look like it would be <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918">good for game players</a>, but a recent investor call by the streamer suggests things are a whole lot worse than we previously imagined. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters told investors that when it came to Warner’s gaming division, it didn’t even factor it into the $83 billion dollar deal. It was apparently considered to add nothing to the company’s overall value, because “they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p> <p>Warner Bros. Games hasn’t exactly shone of late, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">multiple closures</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">extremely talented teams</a>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-season-5-aquaman-offline-update-refund-1851752453">recent flops of <em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em>, but it’s still hardly minor. For one, <em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game of 2023 in the U.S., more popular that <em>Call of Duty</em>, selling 34 million copies in its first year. That’s&nbsp;<em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue.&nbsp;Then you’ve got the <em>Arkham</em> franchise, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, plus the infinite money machine that is every single&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> game from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> to&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> to&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>. Yes, it’s suffered as much as every other arm of the company under David Zaslav, but it’s not something you’d immediately write off as worthless. However, that’s the price Netflix put on Warner Bros. Games when bidding for the whole company.</p>

 <p>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space,” said Gregory Peters on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">December 8 call</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/"><em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>), “we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p>

 <h2>Netflix already failed hard with games</h2> <p>It’s important to put this perspective into context. Netflix has spent <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122"><em>years</em> trying to work out how to make money through video games</a>, and only <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">failed</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">failed again</a>, stripping back expensive forays into the worlds of PC and console gaming and now sticking exclusively to mobile games with a casual emphasis. That makes sense: Netflix is a TV and movie streaming service, and it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">with hubris that it launched its video gaming ambitions</a> into a market that Google had just so spectacularly crashed out of. Big companies look at the sorts of numbers publishers make from a <em>Call of Duty</em> or&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> and think, “We’d like some of that please,” and assume it just happens. It doesn’t, millions gets wasted, and people lose jobs.</p>

 <p>It’s in the aftermath of this that Netflix is attempting its purchase of Warner Bros., so on some level you can understand why a company so disillusioned with gaming might be so <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> with this aspect of the prize. However, it also speaks of some quite spectacular shortsightedness, given the lucrative nature of so many of WBG’s licenses.</p>

 <p>This all suggests bad times are ahead for those surviving developers under Warner’s roof. Peters further comments initially suggest there might be some internal insight, as he says, “Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>Hogwarts</em> is a great example of that<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.” However, “what we’re offering” is the key phrase, given how clear Netflix has recently made its focus on mobile only. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there,” adds Peters, “so we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p> <p>It certainly makes sense to see the IPs Netflix is getting in the deal as opportunities when it comes to its casual gaming development. The&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games are already mobile-friendly and have a broad family audience, while licenses like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Batman</em> can be milked in an endless stream of mediocre cellphone games. But hopes for further entries in Rocksteady’s <em>Arkham</em> franchise seem unlikely to be met, let alone the new owners reviving what Warner Bros. once did best, with game series like <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>FEAR</em>, and other cruelly abandoned Monolith properties.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rogue is the next character set to arrive in Marvel Rivals on December 12 with Season 5.5, and the developers have provided the usual glimpse of her vanguard moves in a new trailer. </p>







<p>Anna Marie, or more commonly known as Rogue, is perhaps one of the most beloved members of the X-Men in the Marvel fandom. Partnered with her <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved Gambit</a>, fans have been wanting to see her inclusion for a long time, and to see her as a vanguard is just the cherry on top. </p>



<h2 id="h-rogue-heading-to-marvel-rivals">Rogue Heading To Marvel Rivals </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rogue: Tempted to Touch | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_CwYQQP21Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At first glance, Rogue looks poised to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-november-20-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake up the meta</a> in a completely unique way. She’s built primarily as a close-quarters brawler, diving into the thick of the fight and dealing impressive damage up close. But she’s far from limited to melee—she can yank enemies toward her and chip away at anyone caught within her damaging aura.</p>



<p>The real show-stealer, though, is her ability to borrow powers from other heroes. Whoever she drains, she can temporarily wield their abilities as if they were her own. The trailer highlights just how versatile this can be: Psylocke’s invisibility, Thor’s lightning strikes—it all becomes part of Rogue’s toolkit, giving her the potential to dominate the battlefield like no other Vanguard.</p>







<p>Her Ultimate amplifies things even further, letting her batter nearby foes while shielding herself and unleashing heavy, punishing blows. A new Vanguard is always an exciting addition to Marvel Rivals, but Rogue looks ready to steal the spotlight in every sense.</p>



<p>It’s always been the season of Rogue and Gambit, and the notorious couple are finally paired together in-game. What do you think of Rogue’s vanguard abilities in Marvel Rivals?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">"What defines a Soulslike?" is a question I would not dare to try and answer on IGN given the myriad viewpoints on it out there, but one oft-discussed feature of FromSoftware's games at least is the "runback", or the... well, run back to a boss after you've died to it, especially when there's a significant distance or challenge involved. Not a lot of games have these. FromSoftware and Hollow Knight games have some heinous ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How heinous? Truly heinous, if the many internet threads and discussions complaining about some of them are any indication. But we wanted to know, which one is the <em>worst?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We ran a poll on IGN last month where we asked readers to vote on the Soulslike boss with the worst runback. To populate our poll options, I consulted a number of sources. I asked our Soulslike experts here at IGN, I asked for suggestions on Bluesky, and I went back to several old Reddit threads in various Souls communities where fans lamented horrible runbacks to see what was complained about the most. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly enough, absolutely no one suggested anything that wasn't either a Hollow Knight game or a FromSoftware game, which perhaps says something about how both of those games approach save points in relation to bosses. I asked IGN staff to think really hard if there were any other bosses from any other games we should add, and we came up with Umi-Bozu from Nioh, just to add some variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then posted the poll on multiple articles connected to Soulslike games, and shared it around on social media asking our readers to vote. We acknowledge this is a rather unscientific poll, given that it was included first in an article explicitly about Bilewater in Hollow Knight: Silksong. That said...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN readers voted for Groal from Silksong as the Soulslike boss with the worst runback, at 16.2% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it wasn't an overwhelming victory. Coming in just behind it with 15.3% was "The entire Dark Souls 2 DLC" which we listed to include the Blue Smelter Demon, Lud and Zallen, and Sir Allone. Again, this is an admittedly unscientific poll - including three bosses in that one probably swung the vote a little bit, but when we asked around so many people mentioned either bosses from or the entirety of the Dark Souls 2 DLC it felt wrong not to group them together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In third place with a marginally more scientific percent of the vote at 9.8% was Placidusax from Elden Ring and... yeah, that chunk of Crumbling Farum Azula you have to run through every time you fight him sucks! Close behind him was Bed of Chaos from the original Dark Souls, an already-frustrating fight compounded by a horrible runback regardless of whether you slog through lava or take the "short"-cut behind Queelag's sister.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Umi-Bozu got the least amount of votes, perhaps suggesting that runbacks outside of Hollow Knight and FromSoftware games really aren't that bad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing Silksong and haven't gotten to Groal yet, great news: we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">walkthrough</a> that will help you survive Bilewater in general, and if you're adverse to using guides, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-psa-youre-missing-a-bench-in-bilewater">quick tip here</a> that will make your runback to Groal... slightly easier. It's still bad. In addition to our Bilewater guide, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">detailed Wiki</a> to help you through every step of your journey in Pharloom, so check it out before, during, and after Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you've already beaten Groal and think our poll is wrong, please feel free to vote above. Percentages mention in this piece are accurate at the time of publication, but maybe there are some Nioh fans that really want to help Umi-Bozu out. Personally, after two straight nights of failing to climb a tower with nothing at the top of it, I'm regretting not having put Baby Steps in this poll somewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
