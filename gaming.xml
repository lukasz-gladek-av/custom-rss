                <p>Early in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> Demetrius comes to your farm and offers to set up a research project in the cave located in the northern part of your farm. The two options presented are bats, which will occasionally leave fruit in the cave, or Mushrooms, which will occasionally spawn in the cave. Demetrius appears to make the offer once you have accumulated 25,000G. This choice is permanent, so you will want to pick the option that works best for you. Here are the benefits of each choice.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bats</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose the Bats, fruit will occasionally spawn in the cave. This is an excellent choice if you want to complete the community bundles as early as possible, since you will need several different kinds of fruit for certain bundles. Otherwise, you will need to plant and grow several fruit trees before waiting for the right season for the tree to grow fruit. The fruit doesn't spawn every day, since there is only a chance, which increases if there is already some fruit in there. The fruit never despawns, so you don't have to check every day.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fruit is useful in the late-game too, since fruit that grows on trees is universally liked, so it's a great steady supply of gifts for villagers. It can also be used for wine as well, which can be nice if you don't want to dedicate a large amount of space for fruit trees. <strong>If you want a steady supply of fruit without needing trees, choose the bats</strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mushrooms</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose Mushrooms, six mushroom boxes will be added to the cave. Every day the boxes will each have one of the five different types of mushrooms, although the chances are heavily weighted towards the Common Mushroom.</p><p><strong>You should choose the Mushrooms if you really enjoy exploring the Mines or Skull Cavern.</strong> The reason is that the Life Elixir item, which unlocks at Combat level 2, can be crafted using one of each of the other four mushrooms; Red, Purple, Morel, and Chanterelle. Life Elixir heals you completely and there isn't really another way to consistently find every type of mushrooms. Outside of crafting the Life Elixir, there isn't really another reason to choose the mushrooms. You do get a free dehydrator with the mushroom cave, but you will unlock the ability to craft them eventually.</p>

                <p>Clay is a relatively common building material found in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, used to make structures and craftable items.

It can be a little inconsistent with how frequently it appears from tilling, but clearing out large areas of dirt, like the patches found near the Carpenter's house, usually yields some Clay. You can also till the large amounts of dirt on your farm--with the exact amount depending on which farm layout you have. You can also till the dirt patches found sometimes in the Mines and Skull Caverns.</p><p dir="ltr">Artifact Spots, which look like worms coming out of the ground, can also yield Clay. Clay can also appear in fishing treasure chests and geodes, but similar to the Artifact Spots, so many different items can appear in these items that it's not a consistent way to find Clay. Clay can also be mined from Clay Veins, but these are only found on Ginger Island, which you won't get access to after completing either the Community Center or the Jojo Mart.</p><p dir="ltr">Clay is used in several crafting recipes and it is used to build a Silo at the Carpenters. Silos allow you to collect and store Hay, which is used to feed Animals, so building it is very important for Ranching.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that not everyone plays video games on Windows. Some users prefer Linux, even on a desktop, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, not every developer supports Linux, which makes it challenging to find and play the games you want. So, can you play Zenless Zone Zero on Linux?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-zenless-zone-zero-support-linux">Does Zenless Zone Zero Support Linux?</h2>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero does not natively support Linux, but it does work. So long as developer miHoYo doesn’t make any significant changes, it should still run fine on Linux. The key is to download and install the game using <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heroic</a>. It’s a free-to-use, open-source game launcher capable of running Epic Game Store, GOG, Amazon Prime Games, and more on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>



<p>Once you download Heroic and install Zenless Zone Zero, consider running the game via Proton Experimental. Most users seem to have luck there.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-steam-deck">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck?</h2>



<p>While Zenless Zone Zero isn’t on Steam and will likely never launch on Valve’s digital storefront, it does somewhat work on Steam Deck. There’s no official support, though. As such, you may run into numerous issues and poor performance.</p>



<p>If you want to try to play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck, you can install the gacha game using Heroic or Lutris. It’s the easiest way to download and play the game on the handheld through the Epic Game Store.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the ROG Ally should have no trouble downloading the game, as it runs Windows natively.</p>



<hr>



<p>While Linux remains in the air, what about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-zenless-zone-zero-offer-controller-support-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controller support in Zenless Zone Zero</a>? While you’re waiting for the game to install, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/today-only-the-2tb-samsung-980-pro-ps5-ssd-is-down-to-135<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One of the most popular and well rated PS5 SSDs around</h2></div><div><section><p>For today only (July 5), Best Buy is offering a 2TB Samsung 980 Pro PS5-compatible solid state drive (SSD) for only $134.99 shipped. SSD prices are still trending upwards for 2024, so it's much more difficult to find a PS5 compatible 2TB M.2 SSD for the same  low prices we saw last year. This is the best deal we've found so far on one of the most popular and reliable brands around. </p><h2>Samsung 980 Pro 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink for $135</h2><div id="199763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Silicon Power XS70 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Preinstalled Aluminum Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The PS5 is an outstanding  gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Games like Gran Turismo 7, Elden Ring, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy 16, and NBA 2K24 each take up 100GB or more all by themselves. If you buy a lot of AAA titles, your drive will fill up very quickly. In addition, if you want to expand the PS5's internal storage without compromising on speed, any old SSD just won't cut it. You'll want to pick up an PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive with a minimum rated 5,500MB/s read speed.</p><p>Samsung SSDs need no introduction. They've made some of the most popular and reliable <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 SSDs</a> on the market. The 980 Pro has been out for a while now and has vetted many times over as an excellent candidate for your PlayStation 5's storage expansion. It is fully PS5 compatible in terms of form factor and performance, with speeds of up to 7,100MB/s. This particular model is preinstaslled with a rugged heatsink that's a lot better than the  flimsy paper-thin graphene "heatsinks" you'll find on some other SSDs at the same price.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC instead of a PS5 console, this SSD would also make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already far faster than any traditional platter hard drive. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. Sure a 4TB SSD would be even better, but they're very, very expensive.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 5, 2024 6:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, while video game adaptations are tougher to come by (although you can be Neo or Trinity in Fortnite), fans shouldn't sleep on a tabletop opportunity to delve into the Matrix, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Encounters-Matrix-Deck-Building/dp/B0CDQW9K97?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Upper Deck's Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</a> deckbuilding game, available on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're a tabletop or deckbuilding game fan but unfamiliar with the Legendary series, you're missing out.

The first Legendary game was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upper-Deck-Legendary-What-If/dp/B0CJL3XLDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel superheroes deckbuilder</a> and has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=legendary+encounters&amp;i=toys-and-games&amp;crid=2M0C27JSNUE41&amp;sprefix=legendary+encounters%2Ctoys-and-games%2C153&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ton of expansions</a>, but I have the first Legendary Encounters, where the franchise expanded into movies with the Alien franchise. While that one seems to be out of print, the game manages to replicate the specific feel of the original Alien franchise, but with cards, and not only is it a fun and well-designed game, it's genuinely pretty tense for a game you play with cards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284" data-ratio="0.88046272493573" data-width="778" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284"></a><figcaption>Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Legendary Encounters: The Matrix was released in 2023, and captures the same feel of the films and lets you join up with up to four other players, and includes characters like Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, as well as villains such as Agent Smith and the Merovingian. The game is played not only with cards, but with a special playmat that dictates the flow of the game and makes learning it a little easier, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually <em>a ton</em> of Legendary Encounters games, dipping into lots of different media franchises--some of which are even a little unexpected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/berserk-board-game-set-for-worldwide-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An official Berserk board game is coming. Fans of the iconic dark fantasy manga can relive its most horrific action-packed moments from the comfort of their table. Better still, thanks to some official partnerships, the game will be coming to store shelves worldwide.</p>
<h2>The <em>Berserk</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the design, production, and sale of the <em>Berserk</em> board game will be handled by Monolith Board Games. Monolith is a France-based board game developer. It was founded in 2014 and has a respectable history of well-designed board games, including <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/222514/batman-gotham-city-chronicles"><em>Batman: Gotham City Chronicles</em></a>,<em> </em>and <em>Claustrophobia 1643</em>.</p>

An official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1113444893542668">Facebook post</a> by Monolith provides additional information. It states the game will use an original game system and be accessible, rich, and intuitive.</p>
<p>Monolith Board Games has several partners producing the <em>Berserk</em> board game. One is Hakusensha, the Japanese manga publishing company behind the manga. The other is Digital Catapult Inc. which specializes in producing and selling media overseas. The latter will distribute English and French language versions of the game in Europe and North America.</p>
<p><em>Berserk</em> is a brutal dark fantasy manga the late Kentaro Miura created. It debuted in 1988 under Hakusensha's semimonthly Young Horses magazine. It tells the story of Guts, a swordsman traveling through a hostile world for revenge. The manga was acclaimed for its mix of Western fantasy trappings, visceral bloody action, bleak atmosphere, and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p>
<p>After almost forty years, <em>Berserk's</em> cultural influence cannot be overstated. It spawned several anime, film, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/berserk-and-band-of-hawk-review-tell-me-why" rel="noopener" target="_blank">game adaptations</a>. It has inspired character archetypes and weapon designs for Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> series. But its most overt influence is on creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki, the one behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dark Souls</em></a> series and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>At time of writing there is no confirmed date of completion or sale for the <em>Berserk</em> board game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-crossplay-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the immense popularity of Fallout 76 following the live-action television series, more players than ever are flocking to post-apocalyptic Appalachia. But they’re spread far and wide across multiple systems. With that in mind, is Fallout 76 crossplay?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-fallout-76-support-crossplay">Does Fallout 76 Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Fallout 76 does not support crossplay completely. There’s a caveat, of course, because it shouldn’t be too simple to play with your friends cross-platform, right? </p>



<p>You can play Fallout 76 crossplay between PC and Xbox Series X|S, but only when playing on the Game Pass version of the multiplayer wasteland adventure. </p>



<p>If you purchased a digital copy from the Xbox Store and your pal purchased a copy through Steam, you cannot play together.</p>



<p>Will the game ever receive crossplay support? There’s no telling. Microsoft is making a huge push to put its games on every platform imaginable, and that often means cross-platform support to some extent. However, the most significant blockage preventing crossplay from moving forward successfully is usually Sony.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-transfer-fallout-76-saves-between-systems">Can You Transfer Fallout 76 Saves Between Systems?</h2>



<p>I hope you’re ready for a little more disappointment, sadly. You cannot transfer save files between systems in Fallout 76. If you previously created a character on the PC version but went out and bought an Xbox Series S on sale, you must start an entirely new save file on the console.</p>



<p>At the very least, it’s an opportunity to test out a new build!</p>



<hr>



<p>Whether you jump in-game with a friend or not, you’ll likely want to start accumulating resources for crafting and construction. Here is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gold-scrap-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Gold Scrap in Fallout 76</a>!

But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into <a title="Genres > Action [1,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.</p><p>With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the <em><a title="Series > Trails [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/trails">Trails</a> through Daybreak</em> saga.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.</p><p>The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.</p><p>With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.</p><p>Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnes’ search for the eighth Genesis?</p><p>A crimson beast’s roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge &amp; EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.</li><li><strong>Cross Charge</strong> – If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy’s attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.</li><li><strong>EX Chains</strong> – EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Chapters</strong> – Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act’s story play out. Once you’ve completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.</li><li><strong>Unique Missions</strong> – Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter’s party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, <a title="Games > Mare" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a>, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_896903"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Van Arkride</strong> – The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnes’ request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.</li><li><strong>Agnes Claudel</strong> – A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnes has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnes first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution’s part-time assistants. At present, Agnes has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she’s had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well…</li><li><strong>Elaine Auclair</strong> – An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker “Beauty’s Blade.” Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department’s elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a ‘crimson’ monster was spotted at the scene of the crime…</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Republic of Calvard</strong> – A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region’s recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.</li><li><strong>Messeldam</strong> – A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oracion—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape’s architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a <em>Trails</em> series overview trailer below.

He's the best character in all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>, in fact. He might be the best character in any From Software game. And if you're the kind of person who makes "git gud" a cornerstone of your personality, you probably missed out on him.</p><p dir="ltr">You find Igon at the base of the Jagged Peak, and at first, he's kind of a pathetic figure. He's already injured when you discover him, and from his wailing laments, you learn that he's trying to kill a huge and horrific dragon called Bayle the Dread. Apparently, Bayle already kicked Igon's ass and he can no longer walk, so being the very nice person that you are, you leave him crying on the side of the road.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Bayle the Dread Dragon Guide | Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">You might have thought Igon was a sad, broken man, but you haven't yet seen the depths of his resolve. Later, as you climb the mountain, you slay a few dragons who stand in your way--first one, alone, and then two together. After winning the battle against two dragons at once, you hear laughter. It's Igon, and seeing your performance convinces him that you're the partner he's been waiting for. He <em>cuts off his own finger</em>--that's how summoning NPCs works in Elden Ring--and gives it to you, begging you to summon his soul in your fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">And reader, you should absolutely summon Igon in the fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">There are those players who are resistant to using summons, whether they're NPCs, spirit ashes, or other players. The release of Shadow of the Erdtree has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-dlc-difficulty-discourse-is-getting-old-spot-on/1100-6524592/">rekindled a lot of discussion around the practice</a>, thanks to the perception among many that the DLC expansion can be annoyingly difficult. It does, at times, feel a little uneven, especially because of its half-baked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/">Scadutree Fragment</a> leveling system that's both wholly separate from traditional leveling and highly dependent on exploration and, to some degree, luck, in order to advance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285"></a><figcaption>When you first find Igon, he has already been wrecked trying to fight dragons, but he is in no way done.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Summons are a release valve on Elden Ring's difficulty, offering ways to even the odds for players who are maybe less skilled, less dextrous, or generally just less able to deal with some of the game's tougher bosses. And then there are those people who never summon, who make it a point to talk about how they never summon, and who ruin any potential to constructively discuss difficulty in game design and how it might be adjusted so that more people can physically play and enjoy a game while still allowing that game to convey the emotions and experiences the difficulty exists to create.</p><p dir="ltr">The sad vanity and arrogance of some of those people caused them to miss out on Igon. It's almost like From Software specifically used Shadow of the Erdtree to call out those people, because like with Igon, there are a number of points in the DLC where summoning a character is essential for advancing their particular story and includes interesting dialogue and fascinating moments you can't get any other way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63TTIrhZcqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/63TTIrhZcqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">None is so fascinating as the story of Igon, though.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing about Bayle is that he is, like, the worst and most-evil dragon. He once fought the dragon Elden Lord, the multi-headed Lord Placidusax, to a standstill. If you played through Elden Ring already, there's a good chance you found and killed Placidusax yourself in Farum Azula, so you know how rough that battle would have been. You can see what it did to Bayle--he's missing half a leg and uses his tail to keep himself standing, and he has a couple of Placidusax's actual heads still buried in his back.</p><p dir="ltr">Igon made it his vow to kill Bayle, and even with his ruined legs, he intends to finish the job. And when you summon him in the fight, he comes in <em>screaming</em>--"CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURSE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYLE"--with a monologue that's almost equivalent to the roars the huge Bayle himself is issuing as you challenge him. Actor Richard Lintern (The Crown) makes his video game debut in voicing Igon and absolutely slaughters it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289" data-ratio="0.96617647058824" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289"></a><figcaption>Source: Elden Ring Alerts on Twitter. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The monologue is totally unexpected, and it's what makes Igon incredible. He comes into this fight ready to do <em>murder</em>, literally too angry to die. It was especially fun for me, because as Igon was yelling his vow to destroy Bayle and how we were about to kick this dragon's ass, I'd already been in the fight for a good minute or so, and I was halfway across the arena with a massive dragon swinging me around like a dog with a chew toy.</p><p dir="ltr">I can't stress enough how much of a phenomenal madman Igon is. This dude <em>just met me</em>. I ran into him at the bottom of the mountain with his legs thrashed, which immediately raises the question of, how did Igon, who wanted to go fight Bayle, end up <em>there</em>, already injured? Did he go up against the dragon alone? Did he get <em>tossed</em> there? Is that what happened to his legs?</p><p dir="ltr">He takes a minute to lament his fate and deal with the overwhelming pain, and you leave him. And then you find him again, where he watches you kill a couple of dragons. Despite not having the use of his legs, he got there <em>ahead of you</em>, and he decides that your martial prowess means you're the one he wants to take him back into the fight against Bayle, once and for all. Shadow of the Erdtree's Captain Ahab will stop at nothing to kill that damnable dragon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Beating Bayle was one of the best moments of Shadow of the Erdtree for me, and at least half of it was because, as Igon screamed in the background, he and I did it "with a hail of harpoons!" This is the stuff I love about Elden Ring--the stuff that expands the world, that makes it feel like more than just you wandering a dead civilization, killing whoever's left. Fighting Bayle with Igon was phenomenal, with him screaming his head off, contributing almost nothing but hype the entire time, and heightened the danger and intensity of the battle all the more. The fight wasn't diminished because I had help; it was enriched and expanded because fighting Bayle meant something to Igon, and thus, it meant something to me. He has more personality than most From Software characters, and I hope they take a page from his ludicrous bellowing and overbearing obsession to make more memorable folks like him in future games.</p><p dir="ltr">It's pretty clear that fighting Bayle with Igon is the way From Software meant it to be experienced, and I'm glad some weird gatekeeping and purity testing didn't keep that from me. Beating a challenging boss is cool, but I'll remember Bayle a lot longer because of Igon.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has taken to Twitter to call out Apple for rejecting the company's app submission, claiming that it's arbitrary and obstructive.</p><p>"Apple has rejected our Epic Games Store notarization submission twice now, claiming the design and position of Epic’s 'Install' button is too similar to Apple's 'Get' button and that our 'In-app purchases' label is too similar to the App Store's 'In-App Purchases' label," Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179988131713090" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained</a>.</p><p>Epic Games continued, saying that it is using the same "Install" and "In-app purchases" naming conventions that are used on multiple different popular app stores and platforms.

			<p>It's long been maintained by GTA V fans that a proper single-player DLC/expansion never came because GTA Online became too much of a focus for Rockstar Games following its enormous and continued success over the years.</p>
<p>Now, at last, we have some sort of confirmation from former Rockstar camera artist Joe Rubino, who worked on Max Payne 3 and GTA V. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber SanInPlay</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away (after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V), and I kind of took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for Grand Theft Auto that never came out. That was my thing. I was one of the main editors and camera artists and did a lot of the on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg (the actor that played Trevor) was a very important part of.</em></p>
<p><em>Then some of the team overlapped and went to Red Dead Redemption 2 early on, and then we just kind of did this, because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money. A lot of that stuff, though, did end up making it, I believe, into later iterations of GTA Online. It's not like they wasted it. It was really, really good. What happened was when GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow, and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that. I think looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, you know? But that was a business decision that they made.</em></p>
<p><em>I was a little upset about that. Actually, a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time is that I was like, guys, this shit's awesome. Let's keep going, let's finish this. We went about probably halfway through it and then we put a pause on it because GTA Online was just so... People were going crazy (about it).</em></p>
<p>With Rockstar's resources, Rubino's point that the studio could have likely finished a halfway-done GTA V story standalone DLC makes sense. It was likely a decision made by the executives rather than the creative people, who would have certainly loved to release the content.</p>
<p>GTA Online is still running strong to this day. The studio has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Bottom Dollar Bounties update and promised more to come throughout the rest of the year.&nbsp;With GTA VI currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for Fall 2025</a>, it'll be interesting to see how Rockstar handles the transition between the respective games' online modes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO & PD100X Review]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review.920082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When you’re doing any sort of content creation, whether it be streaming, podcasting, recording, or whatever, one of the most important areas of your setup needs to be the microphone you use. A quality microphone will help you go from a poor production to top level in no time, and will let your listeners enjoy the soothing sounds of your voice the best way possible.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a lot of options out there that it can be tough finding that balance between what you can afford and good quality. One company trying to bridge the gap between affordable and quality is Maono.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company has a number of microphone options for all budgets. Recently, it released its new PD100X mid-level microphone to go along with its Maonocaster G1 NEO audio interface. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks using the setup as my daily driver for content, and I’m here to tell you whether or not I think it’s something you should consider if you’re looking to get into content creation of any kind.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.maono.com/products/g1neo-and-pd100x-gaming-bundle-for-game-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retailing for $119.99 as a package</a>, it’s hard to find a better mic and mixer bundle for a better price. But price is only one part of the equation. How does everything perform under use?</p>



<p>Starting with the mixer. To be perfectly honest, it’s one of the nicer and most functional audio interfaces that I’ve used. It looks basic and only supports one XLR input, but what it does, it does really well.</p>



<p>The Maonocaster G1 NEO features 48V phantom power for your microphone and a number of streamer-friendly features without having to do much of a setup. There’s a noise reducer option that blocks out background noise such as fans quite well along with a SideChain feature that automatically lowers the volume of the music you have playing through your interface, turning it into a properly adjusted backing track for your voice over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a simple voice changer button that adjusts the pitch of your voice if you’re into that sort of thing as well as a toggle for directly monitoring your sound through your headset. A lot of expected features, but it comes with another feature that went from being a nice-to-have to one that I can’t live without: a sound board.</p>



<p>On the device there are four extra buttons that you can use for a soundboard. From simple sound effects to clipping and using songs, you can use it for pretty much anything you can think of. Lastly, the board features Bluetooth connection, allowing you to sync your phone or any other Bluetooth audio source to pass through music, sound effects, or anything else.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-does-the-mic-sound">How Does The Mic Sound?</h3>



<p>While the interface is really nice, none of it matters if the PD100X microphone isn’t a quality sound. On that front, the word to use with it is: okay.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad mic. Like I said, it’s okay. It’s just one that you’ll need to do some work with to get it rolling out of the box. </p>



<p>It does a solid job of blocking out background noise immediately, something that even the more pricey mics can struggle with. The PD100X also is quality on keeping away any noise behind the microphone, a benefit of the cardioid polar pattern.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Connection</td><td>USB/XLR</td></tr><tr><td>Mic Type</td><td>Dynamic</td></tr><tr><td>Polar Pattern</td><td>Cardioid</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency Response</td><td>40Hz-16kHz</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Rate</td><td>48kHZ/24-bit</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Where the PD100X doesn’t perform well is handling peaking and general level stability. Every time I used it, even if I left settings alone, the slightest adjustment of your position to the mic will have you frustrated at the levels. It’s not a major problem if you’re pre-recording content or doing something that will need multiple takes. However, it can get annoying for both you and your listeners/viewers when you are doing something live and you get comments on the sound issues.</p>



<p>There are also too many issues with the gain where the slightest change will have you sounding like you are speaking through a drive-thru speaker box. I found myself messing with the gain and general audio levels too much when doing live content that it took away from the overall presentation.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/">Logitech G Has A New Gaming Keyboard, And It’s Impressive</a></h6>



<p>Should you not want to use a mixer, the PD100X also comes with a USB cable that can be connected directly to your PC. Both have their pros and cons like XLR not letting you use the RGB on the mic and the USB connection pickup up and and all clicks on the on-board wheel and mute button.</p>



<p>Additionally, should you connect via USB, you can use the Maono Link or Maono Arena apps for mixing purposes. Just know you’ll need to create an account in order to use their software.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review-verdict">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As a package, the Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO and PD100X are solid, especially at such an affordable price point. The interface has a lot of nice features and works well even with other branded XLR mics. Hell, I even hooked up my guitar to it via XLR, and found that it worked pretty well for that, too.</p>



<p>The mic, on the other hand, just doesn’t do much for me. It’s an okay entry level option if you decide to go with it. Just be ready, as I said, to do a bit of manual work getting it to sound right. The frustration of constantly adjusting the levels and dealing with clipping just turns me off too much when there are other options that work better straight out of the box. It also would be nice if you could just buy the interface on its own. Unfortunately, it seems that if you really want the Maonocaster G1 NEO, you have to get the mic with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the patch, a fix for the Tortured Gift of Amulets chest in Helltides means it will thankfully soon reward more items as originally intended. Boss summoning materials will be worth more gold, so players who aren't keen on actually using them can now vendor them for more profit. The sale price for Blackened Femurs, Gurgling Heads, and Trembling Hands are increasing from 20,000 to 50,000 gold, while Stygian Stones will increase from 70,000 to 150,000 gold.</p><p dir="ltr">In another change, the drop rate for Elixirs is going down, meaning players may need to rely more on crafting Elixirs to suit their needs. Conversely, the drop rates for Tempering manuals is increasing "to be more consistent." Last but not least, a welcome UI change for Tempered items will mean items will display icons for the associated Tempering affix category, instead of all Tempered affixes sharing the same icon. You can read the full patch notes for the update below.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 is currently in the middle of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/" data-ref-id="1100-6523441">Season 4 Loot Reborn update</a>, which brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">major changes to its item progression and endgame</a>.
