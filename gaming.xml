<h2 id="h-when-does-farming-simulator-25-release">When Does Farming Simulator 25 Release?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 officially launches on <strong>November 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</strong>. Currently, there’s no word about the farming simulation game launching on Game Pass, though the previous title did within a year of its release.</p>



<p>Typically speaking, many titles from Giants Software launch somewhat roughly, with countless bugs and glitches plaguing the gameplay on day one until the first patch hits. For long-time fans, it won’t matter. They know what’s coming, and they’re excited to play. You’ll find me behind the wheel of a tractor this month, that’s for sure!</p>

<p>As an active subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, I’m constantly on the lookout for new and upcoming titles hitting the monthly subscription platform. Who doesn’t want to test out new releases without paying any additional money? But not every title launches on Game Pass, leaving some communities waiting or caving in and buying a copy on day one. So, which is it for the upcoming farming game we’re all eagerly awaiting? Is Farming Simulator 25 on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-farming-simulator-25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Is Farming Simulator 25 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of right now, Farming Simulator 25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. It could happen in the future, likely within one year of its launch, as the last game in the franchise did, but for now, we must either buy a copy or wait. For many, that means waiting. Now, I’m a massive fan of farming games in general, and I love Farming Simulator as a whole, but I know from firsthand experience that a Giants Software release is, more often than not, quite buggy. </p>







<h2 id="h-where-can-you-play-farming-simulator-25">Where Can You Play Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>While most long-time fans of the franchise will ultimately play Farming Simulator 25 on PC, there’s still a growing community on Xbox Series X|S interested in the game. If you’re in the latter camp, you should know the game is approximately $10 more expensive per edition on console. On PC, it’s $49.99 for the Standard Edition but $59.99 on Xbox Series X|S for the same version.</p>



<p>In any case, the farming simulation game is coming to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>FS25 will also offer Mac support.</p>



<p>Will you grab a copy of Farming Simulator 25 on day one or wait for the inevitable Game Pass release? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the community forums</a> to discuss the game and series more!</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-4k-box-set-is-over-50-off-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526972/" data-ref-id="1100-6526972">Indiana Jones franchise</a> began in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film that many would argue remains the best movie in the series. Bethesda and MachineGames' upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, takes some influence from each of the three original films. But in the latest extended gameplay video, the Great Circle has more than a passing resemblance with Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20x3FPB_G5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/20x3FPB_G5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The parallels start early in the video, when Indy takes an idol from its perch and triggers a trap, much like the opening minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It could be argued that this the incident that taught Indy to use a counterweight when swapping out idols, although that strategy still failed him in Raiders. </p><p>A good deal of the tone also feels like it was lifted from Raiders, including the sequence where Indy is at Marshall College, his home away from home when he isn't hunting down priceless relics. The game's heroine, Gina, echoes Indy's first love, Marion Ravenwood, in part because the former has an agenda that doesn't necessarily line up with his. Indy wants to stop the Nazis from uncovering the secrets of the Great Circle, while Gina is an Italian journalist who just wants to find her missing sister. </p><p>No Indiana Jones story would be complete without a globe-spanning adventure, and the Great Circle has that as well. Indy's primary weapons against the Nazi guards are usually his fists, or anything that happens to be at hand. The video also teases some of the puzzles that Indy has to solve, as well as some sequences that move into third-person view while Indy navigates hidden tombs. </p><p>That largely lines up with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which emphasized stealth over combat. And Indy won't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-a-humane-solution-for-battling-dogs/1100-6527484/" data-ref-id="1100-6527484">ever shoot or punch a dog in the game</a>. Nazis, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">are fair game for both</a>.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in Spring 2025.</p>

Seven years after being announced, Project Borealis - a fan-developed game based on an unused story treatment for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-3">Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a> - has a playable ten-minute Prologue on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Project Borealis was formally unveiled by developer Icebreaker Industries back in 2017, as an attempt to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-valve-writer-reveals-what-may-have-been-half-life-2-episode-3s-story">ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3</a> a reality. Epistile 3, for the uninitiated, was a gender-swapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170825025137/http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/">story synopsis</a> charting the adventures of Gertrude Fremont that many believed detailed the events originally planned Half-Life 2: Episode 3.
</p>
<p>
The Project Borealis team <a href="https://projectborealis.com/blog/">continued to share updates on its progress</a> until March 2020, but then all went silent, suggesting another fan game had met an untimely demise. However, the project's social media feed briefly sputtered to life in 2022 with a <a href="https://x.com/Proj_Borealis/status/1562877476455325697">short video of a crowbar laying in the snow</a>, and now two years later again, it's finally all systems go.

<p>
September brought word Project Borealis had been reborn in Unreal Engine 5 and that Icebreaker would soon be releasing a ten-minute Prologue, set before the events of the full game. And now that Prologue is now here, whisking players to a version of Ravenholm "transformed by time and the elements". As per its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">Steam page</a>, "The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within."
</p><p>
Icebreaker calls Prologue a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game". It promises "completely updated visuals", a "faithful recreation of iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> movement and gameplay mechanics", and an original score. And as to why Icebreaker has decided to release this small slice of its bigger project, studio director Postulio recently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/project-borealis-the-fan-made-effort-to-bring-half-life-2-episode-3-to-life-returns-after-years-of-silence-with-a-new-prologue-teaser/">told PC Gamer</a>, the decision to use Unreal Engine 5 instead of Valve's Source engine had necessitated recreating Half-Life 2's movement, physics, combat, and ambience, and that the team wanted to "make sure we were on the right track".
</p>
<p>
"This also gave us an excuse to refine our own internal processes as a community studio," Postulio added, "until we were left with a pipeline that could produce a 'finished' product." A little more detail on the project and where it's heading next can be found in Project Borealis' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nDJ9k_AWoQ">newly released Update 6 developer video</a>, and the Prologue itself is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">available to download for free on Steam</a>, but requires a copy of Half-Life 2 to play.
</p>
<p>
It is, then, a bit of an intriguing time for the legendary first-person shooter series. Not only is Icebreaker exploring one possible future for Gordon Freeman, it's heavily rumoured Valve may be returning to the series itself, with August bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">reports</a> a "fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game" was in the works. Just don't expect it to have a '3' in the title.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-the-things-we%E2%80%99ve-learned-after-a-year-of-running-our-own-website.1032942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/welcome-to-aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When the five of us launched Aftermath back in November 2023</a> we all had a ton of experience working at websites like Kotaku, The Washington Post and Vice. Writing, reporting, editing, video, we'd done it all. <em>Owning</em> a website, though, has been a whole other thing.</p><p>It has been, in short, one hell of a learning experience! Working at a larger site, even at a senior level as some of us had, is nothing like working at Aftermath. At other sites we'd been part of big companies, all of which had their own accounts department, their own human resources, a travel team, social media experts and lawyers. </p><p>At Aftermath we have...us. We're everything and everyone. Got a technical issue with your account and need to send an email? That's us. Got a complaint? That's us. Filing taxes, <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building a merch store</a>, doing accounts, bank stuff, social media work, Instagram page curation, legal paperwork and <em>God so much more</em>, it's all us.</p><p>It's been confronting, to say the least, and it hasn't always been smooth sailing, but we've somehow made it through all the bumbling, confusion and spreadsheets to celebrate our first birthday! So in the interests of transparency--and as a helpful guide for anyone else looking to start up a worker-owned business--we thought we'd look back on some of the lessons we've learned trying to own, run and write for a website at the same time:</p><p><strong>Luke</strong></p><p>I will never underestimate how much work it takes to keep a small business running ever again, because I would rather walk into the ocean than start another small business. I never appreciated at my last job how I was just able to write, but now enormous parts of my day are spent on social media, in emails, in spreadsheets and Word docs, all on stuff that doesn't even make it onto the page, it just keeps the business running.</p><p>And it makes me feel bad! People are paying money to read what the five us of are writing! So I hope folks can understand that if we have a slow day, or a slow week, it's not because we're taking it easy; that just might be a week where we all need to sign off on a new Operating Agreement, or someone is sick and someone else is away but those left have to fix a broken social media aggregator or meet with an accountant.</p><p>If you've been reading us for the year and have ever felt that way, then we're sorry, we're grateful for your support and are really trying! We've got big plans for Year Two, and that includes most of us being able to go full-time (some of us have been part-time for much of 2024), so hopefully there'll be more blogs on the website in 2025.</p><p><strong>Riley</strong></p><p>I've already written about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal revelations</a> during our Inside Baseball week, but from a broader perspective, a joke I make a lot now is that I finally understand why businesses employ so many people. There are simply so many tasks in so many areas that used to be someone else's problem; even when I was top of the masthead at other sites, there was always <em>something</em> that was handled by a different department, or there was at least someone I could reach out to for help.</p><p>Here, it's just us. Sometimes, that feels like it's just me--I handle the bulk of what I'd call the "business" stuff, and even when it's not a lot of tasks, it's a lot of cognitive load. A very minor example: I have been haunted for nearly a year by a new kind of form I have to file, one that comes with steep penalties for not filing, and one that's a little confusing for our business. That's not a lot of work, but it's the kind of stuff I spent my life blissfully unaware of until this year, and now it stresses me out. I used to be a punk who lived on a boat, man! And now I'm reading government websites about weird forms!</p><p>On the flip side, I feel like I've gotten more insight into how bloated businesses can become. We've all had the experience of it taking forever to get a freelance payment, and I've been the guy who has had to chase down such payments through a labyrinthine corporate structure. Something I'm proud of at Aftermath--and I hope our freelancers would agree--is that we pay promptly. This is easy to do because... it's just me, pressing the buttons. I can just publish the story and then press the "pay someone" buttons! On one hand that's a question of scale, and probably evidence of how janky some of our systems are, but on the other, I think it's a small example of how we're able to do certain things better than big companies, and how we're able to live our values through the business itself because it's ours. It's important to me to pay freelancers promptly, so I do it. It's really empowering to have control over the systems like that.</p><p>If I were going to give advice, one thing I regret is that I feel like we didn't talk enough about the growth phase when we were first dreaming Aftermath up. We sort of thought we would either succeed or fail right away, and I'm not sure we really reflected enough on the situation we've found ourselves in this year, where the business is growing, but not quite fast enough to be a full-time job for most people. (I work here full-time because I've been lucky to have some savings that have enabled me to do that, but that's also its own source of stress.) That situation can make it hard to know if the business is going well, especially when there are so many different pieces with their different measures of success, and so many different ways to measure success generally. (When people ask me "Is the company making money?" or "How many subscribers do you have?" they are fascinated when I'm like "Well see, it depends how you measure 'money' or 'subscribers,'" which are nouns I had always thought were fairly cut and dried until this year.) If you're thinking of launching something on your own, one thing I would advise is talking honestly with each other about your personal financial situations and how much runway you each have, so you can separate the business' situation from your own personal situation and needs, and so you can set goals for where you need to get to by when and plan for contingencies if that doesn't work out.</p><p>Lastly, while I can sometimes feel a bit lonely working at a site that's so small (I am a nerd who, at my last jobs, absolutely loved getting to talk to people across my companies), the fact that so many of our worker-owned peers have given us advice never ceases to move me. We've even dispensed advice of our own this year! That so many people are rooting for us, and are so willing to answer an email or hop on a call, feels like something really special about this movement we're part of.</p><p><strong>Nathan</strong></p><p>Lessons I’ve learned this year, ranked:</p><p><em>1. Ask for help! </em>Aftermath would probably be a pile of “What if we started a website together? JK… unless” DMs if not for countless rounds of emails exchanged with folks from Defector, Hell Gate, 404, and other worker-owned sites. We came into this clueless, but we were immediately embraced by a bunch of smart people who just wanted to help, no strings attached. (Also, we are now happy to offer whatever meager advice we can to others who are in the same position we were a year ago! We cannot, however, promise that it will be good advice.)</p><p><em>2. Live without regrets.</em> Well OK, have <em>some </em>regrets, but don’t let them define your experience of starting an independent video game blog (or an affordable hotel for dogs, or whatever it is you’re aspiring to do). We made A LOT of mistakes this year on the business side of things. We could have spent and negotiated far more intelligently, and we could have begun doing so much sooner. But we didn’t have the benefit of hindsight at the time. When we realized we fucked up, it hit like a truck, because this thing is so fragile and precious to us. It’s hard not to worry that the slightest bump in the road will cause it to shatter into a million pieces. For now, though, we’re still kicking. Next year, we’ll apply the lessons we learned this year, and in five years, we’ll barely even remember the time we poured all of our subscriber money into <a href="https://aftermath.site/what-the-fuck-are-we-even-doing-here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a second season of <em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, just now (note: this is a joke).</p><p><em>3. Community good.</em><strong> </strong>When you work in more traditional journalism, your main interactions with your supposed community occur in caustic comment sections or via Twitter, a collective nightmare from which we all finally seem to be waking. Turns out, rare exceptions aside, these are not effective means of forming a real, lasting community! They’re just haphazardly-paved streets for drive-by arguments. By curating our spaces – honestly, the small fee does quite a bit of heavy lifting, but our Discord moderators also deserve a ton of credit – we’ve managed to build something that feels authentically cohesive, conscientious, and supportive. Aftermath is a chill place to talk about video games on the internet. Can you believe that one of those exists? Me neither! Our readers <em>show up</em>, too, whether that means reading, commenting, watching streams, listening to podcasts, telling other people they should subscribe, or any number of other small kindnesses. When you work in independent media, community is everything, and while building and maintaining it is another part of the job – not just something you can engage with every time you press publish and then immediately tune out – it actually rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>4. Nothing is too dumb.</em><strong> </strong>Working for The Washington Post slowly robbed me off the blogger’s greatest instinct: to see something or have an idea and just Toss It Up. Aftermath has both allowed and required me to get reacquainted with the side of myself that would, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview a dog</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">count Gokus</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/dog-speedrun-sgdq-peanut-butter-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview the same dog again</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be a menace to Geoff Keighley</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">egg</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/alarmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alarmo</a>. I feel immensely privileged to have an audience that’s willing to go along with so many bits that may, in some cases, seem elaborate, but which I promise you sprang to mind fully formed, literally every time. For me, however, it’s also a necessary skill at a place like this. We’re a team of five, for whom this is not our sole source of income. Some days we have to keep the site moving, and we’re not always gonna have bombshell reporting in our back pocket. That said, we also don’t want to skimp on quality. Aftermath subscribers are paying for a premium service, not a firehose of blogs about weekly <em>Fortnite </em>challenges or whatever. I feel like if I’m not engaging my creativity even on the small stuff, I’m slacking or letting our audience down – and they’ll notice, because they’re smart and intensely clued-in. So it’s a balancing act: How do you keep the site feeling alive without putting yourself at death’s door? We’re still working on getting it right! But I feel that we’re much better at it now than we were one year ago, or even just a few months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>5. Good things take time.</em> On the other hand, I am somebody who likes to work on big reported projects, and because of the many responsibilities I – like everybody else at Aftermath – have, those things aren’t as easy to dedicate multiple days per week to as they were at, say, The Washington Post. But it’s not like those stories are just gonna go away. Yes, I might get scooped, but even then, there’s often an opportunity to tell a bigger, more in-depth version of that story, or a similar story, or an adjacent story. Unfortunately, games journalism is a small and shrinking field, and even in the best of times it struggled to follow stories beyond games’ launch dates or singular explosive moments. The upside of this is that our audience – unlike the fickle whims of traffic, ad markets, and all that nonsense – actually lets us cook, so there’s more room to tell stories of, well, the aftermath of news events. We can afford to take our time. We don’t have to rush or pull the plug on a project because the moment’s passed. That said, deprogramming myself of <em>the instinct</em> to do those things has been a little trickier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>6. Everything is advertising.</em> Keeping a subscription-based site afloat means constantly converting new people into subscribers, both by going outside your usual bubble and preaching to the choir that follows you on social media but won’t part with just $7 per month to make sure you can eat. A small percentage of subscribers regularly leaves, after all, whether due to financial concerns, changing tastes, subscription fatigue, or whatever else. You can’t avoid it, so you’ve just got to compensate for it. This means you’re constantly pitching, trying to find inventive new ways to convince people that your thing is worth the asking price of almost no money, but still some<em> </em>money. On the upside, it can actually be kinda fun, especially if you care about and believe in the thing you’re advertising – which we very much do. Did somebody tweet about the site? Retweet that. Did somebody post about wearing your merch? Repost that. Did somebody say something that could vaguely be construed as relevant to the site? Are they <em>famous</em>? Then you’re about to have a field day. The fact of the matter is, shilling in the modern age is just one big bit. If you remain committed to the bit, you will succeed. Or at least you’ll make a few people laugh, and that’s good too.&nbsp;</p><p><em>7. It’s OK to learn as you go.</em><strong> </strong>I think it’s fair to say that I got off to a shaky start as a podcast host. These days, I’m a little better! By this time next year, I will be the greatest podcast host on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>8. Getting hit by a worker-owned truck.</em></p><p><em>9. I’m honestly pretty over ranked list jokes.</em><strong> </strong>Ah, well. Nevertheless.</p><p><strong>Gita</strong></p><p>For a long time, I was afraid that my major contribution to this site was talking about it at parties. It turns out that this is a real job, and it is called marketing and communications. As a longtime lover of gossip and cheeky little chats about who did what, it has been incredible to learn that none of this is superfluous--this is exactly how you find your allies and build your master plans. There won't be gossip if there isn't a community, and with community you can find your supporters, the people who wouldn't know how to help until you ask them for it.</p><p>This is a lesson you can take into your every day life as well. If you are social and need something done, it's actually very likely you know a guy who knows a guy. Connecting these people isn't something that just happens on its own. A lot of people are actually very shy and discount their own abilities. If you're an extrovert or a social butterfly, people do actually appreciate how outgoing you are--people love being listened to, and they love to be included. So put on a party dress and bring your big ideas to your next gathering of friends. Somebody can probably help, and they're just waiting to be asked.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong></p><p>I have learned a lot of things this year of Aftermath, much of which seems painfully obvious in retrospect. Being reader supported is a form of liberation I wish on every games and tech writer. It brings out the best in your writing, freeing you to build out your beat rapidly. You find your voice and interest in ways that would normally be complicated by pandering to SEO and perceptions of what the news cycle demands. You discover fast what you enjoy writing,&nbsp; what your audience enjoys reading, and what your audience enjoys about you as a writer.</p><p>I have also found out that, while still difficult and imperfect, a flat hierarchy softens many issues that come from a traditional workplace. There is a frankness to being of equal stake that encourages dialogue otherwise stifled. It is a logical extension of the solidarity I felt with doing union work, and as a result I have become an evangelist for it. What’s more, this feeling is not unique to me. I have learned that cooperatives love helping each other, trading notes about how best to survive. Perhaps this is because we are so rarified – like flowers growing through cracks in scorching cement.</p><p>I do not know if this new wave of New Cooperative Journalism or whatever we are calling it can serve as an adequate replacement for the crumbling institutions that came before us. There are issues of scale and mentorship that simply have yet to be solved. How do you build something cooperative that has the same relevance and scale as the New York Times, for example? Though small, what we do only works because everyone involved has spent a good deal of time honing our craft. How does passing on institutional knowledge to young writers work in this new context?</p><p>I don’t pretend to have anything approaching an answer to those questions, but I know the path to answering them, either by ourselves or one of our sister sites, is much shorter, straighter and more just in our arrangement than in traditional media. When your hands touch every part of the business directly, you quickly see what works and what doesn’t and diagnose what is immediately vital to the health of the project specifically and your colleagues generally. For as much as&nbsp;<em>The Adults In The Room&nbsp;</em>loved to lecture us at gunpoint about efficiency, we have found ourselves to be far leaner, faster, kinder, healthier and better without their dead weight.</p><p>Aftermath is a grand experiment, and every day I am shocked at how much of it just works.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s much easier to plan ahead than it is to upgrade your pathing down the line. So, to that end,<strong> I recommend you start your game—no matter the game mode—by pausing and creating a general layout</strong>. You can use the pathing tool to size up for a central concourse, as in the screenshot above, to help you plan out the general flow of your park. </p><p>As a park manager, you’ll want to guide patrons toward rides, merchandise, and meals that earn you money. If they can’t reach these attractions, they’ll glitch into a big ball and remain stuck, blocking future visitors from passing.</p><h2 id="h391768"><a id=""></a>Scenery boosts ride and park appeal</h2><figure id="" data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When’s the last time you went to an amusement park? Was it a barren landscape with cobwebs and dust bunnies rolling across the parking lot? Or was it full of life, with unique scenery that beckons the imagination to run wild? Most likely the latter, what makes for an exciting theme park in real life also works in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>.</p><p>Once you place down a ride, spend a little time on its surroundings. You don’t necessarily have to follow a theme; it can be a mish-mash of different scenery objects and types, but you’ll want to eliminate much of the empty space within your park to boost appeal. The more appeal your rides and attractions have, the more Prestige you earn and the better your park performs overall. Keep these elements in mind and ou’ll be swimming in money—which you may then reinvest!</p><h2 id="h391769"><a id=""></a>Learn the major hotkeys</h2><figure id="" data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing on PC—the best platform for <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—you’ll have access to numerous hotkeys to help construct the park of your dreams.

If they require drinks, provide them with a Gulpee stand. If they’re hungry, you’ll want to add Chief Beef. However, a new gameplay mechanic in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—dynamic weather—provides additional challenges beyond the tangible. </p><p>As the weather varies, so too do your guests’ comfort levels. They’ll seek cover and retreat to the waterpark if it’s too hot. If it’s raining, they’ll look for umbrellas. But without space for guests to hunker down, they’ll ultimately leave. You must consider the weather when crafting every inch of your park; that way, visitors spend more time and money!</p><p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> isn’t the only hit launching in November.

Colin Farrell recently talked about his role in the movie and how the character might change following the events of the TV show. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194566" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Let's Talk About Gotham Knights’ Predictable Ending" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="262" data-playlist="194566,192862,197298" data-current="194566"><div><p>Let's Talk About Gotham Knights’ Predictable Ending</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194566/194566_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20022.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The actor said his Penguin has about five or six scenes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049">in <em>The Batman Part II</em></a></span>, which isn’t due out until October 2026. He hasn’t even read the script yet though, and isn’t sure how his character’s meaty arc across eight episodes of the HBO spin-off will be brought to bear on the Batman reboot’s sequel. “I signed up for three Batman films, but I didn’t know if I’d be in the second film,” Farrell told <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview</a></span>. “Matt Reeves is a brilliant writer and an extraordinary filmmaker, and what I’m most excited-slash-nervous about in the second film is not what Oz does—or what predicaments he finds himself in, or what moments of success he gets to experience—but what his voice is.”</p><p> The actor continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>How is his personality? It was forming and changing in the limited series, and, by the end of the eight episodes, it’s concretized into something else. There is a degree of almost delusion psychopathy present in the last scene. So how is that taken up in the second film? I was told I have five or six scenes. I don’t have any hopes or any expectations. I’m really an open book, and that’s the way I get excited by shit or not. I think sometimes actors, if they have a career that has a certain length of time, they sometimes get to make too many decisions. Which isn’t to say I won’t push back or argue or fight in Oz’s corner—I do believe I know him better than anyone now.</p></blockquote><p>While the success and critical acclaim of the HBO show provides a lot of extra room for <em>The Batman Part II</em> to play with the Penguin’s character, it will probably still be circumscribed by the fact that most of its potential movie-going audience will never have seen the show in the interim. But for fans at least, it should hopefully make Farrell’s character a lot more interesting and impactful than his lively but one-dimensional presentation in the last <em>Batman</em> movie. </p><p>More importantly, what are the chances that we get a season 2 of <em>The Penguin</em> sometime farther down the road? While Farrell previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Total Film</em></a></span>, “I never want to put on that fucking suit and fucking head again,” he recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> he’d be willing to return under the right circumstances. </p><p>“If there’s a great idea [for season two], and the writing was really muscular and as strong or stronger on the page than it was the first season, of course I would do it,” he said. “For me, the bar for success is not very high. It’s, ‘Do most people like it?’—just the simplicity of that. I love being in things that are critically approved—it’s much better than the alternative—but I’ve been around long enough [to know] that it’s the audience who are really the most important critics.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Toss in other accessories like a juke box toy and table with cookies, and it’s a fun set that’d make a great holiday gift.</p></div>                      </div><hr><p>A handful of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%2Ftoys%2Fbuilding-toys%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fone-of-the-best-lego-minecraft-sets-drops-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6527684%2F%3Fcomment_page%3D1&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">other Lego sets are discounted at Walmart</a> during its early Black Friday sale, including ones that let you build a replica Ford Mustang or Bugatti Bolide.

			<p>Crowbar Collective, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-black-mesa-version-1-0-launch-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Mesa</a> (the fan-made remake of Half-Life), has announced a new cooperative first-person shooter game for PC called Rogue Point. It will be published by Team17, whose General Manager Ann Hurley said in the press release:</p>
<p><em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with first-person shooter veterans Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.</em></p>
<p>Crowbar Collective CEO and project lead Adam Engels stated:</p>
<p><em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team for our upcoming co-op shooter, Rogue Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new [intellectual property] (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will debut <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> in 2025, where it will stay for about a year, according to Crowbar Collective's estimates. Here's an overview of Rogue Point straight from the store page:</p>
<h2><em>Campaign</em></h2>
<p><em>Dive into the heat of battle in our campaign, where high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning. Team up, gather intel, and launch assaults against top-tier mercenaries. Face off against the formidable 5 Star Merc, the pinnacle of MERX lethal contractors. Brace for tough, unyielding enemies and relentless action that will push your skills, gear, and teamwork to the extreme.</em></p>
<h2><em>Relentless Replayability</em></h2>
<p><em>Fight and maneuver your way through missions spread across 4 diverse locations:</em></p>
<p><em>● The Airport</em></p>
<p><em>● The Mall</em></p>
<p><em>● The Office</em></p>
<p><em>● The Oilrig</em></p>
<p><em>Each sprawling map is reshaped by the game's Parametric Design System, offering new strategies and challenges with every play. The constantly evolving gameplay ensures every mission feels as thrilling and unique as your first, keeping the excitement alive in every campaign.</em></p>
<h2><em>AI Classes</em></h2>
<p><em>In Rogue Point, your enemy is MERX. These mercenaries for hire will challenge your team to strategize and work tactically. Each MERX class has their own AI playstyle that to pack a punch in their own unique way.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Soldier</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Your basic grunt class. They carry pistols &amp; assault rifles, throw grenades, and work in a squad. You’ll encounter these a lot in Rogue Point, but they are never to be underestimated.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Berserker</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Juiced up on substances and with no regard for their own life, the Berserker's singular goal is to close the distance and slice your whole team with a machete. They are agents of chaos and will wreck your carefully crafted game plan.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sniper</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Heavily fortified in the far distance, snipers will pin your team down and deny you entry into important areas. Their only tell is the laser beam from their gun, and your teammate’s head exploding next to you.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Heavy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Heavies are big, slow brutes that don’t take cover and eat bullets. You can dump all your ammo into them with no effect. Run the other way, or find their one weakness.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>5-Star Mercenary</strong></em></p>
<p><em>These legendary MERX commanders have received the top star rating in the app. Intel on these is sketchy, but we know that these endgame encounters will require your team’s full strength to have a chance to take them down. If you succeed, take a trophy from their body as proof you have triumphed.</em></p>
<h2><em>Intuitive Gameplay</em></h2>
<p><em>Rogue Point is perfect for both fresh recruits and seasoned veterans, presenting an accessible entry point that reveals layers of depth for those who seek a challenge. Crave fast-paced action or deep, skill-driven gameplay? Rogue Point kicks down the door to a world of relentless, gripping excitement.</em></p>
<h2><em>Economy</em></h2>
<p><em>Earn your keep on the frontlines, then purchase new hardware for your arsenal. Deck out your loadout with hi-tech attachments, and plenty of tactical equipment to make infiltration and extraction a breeze. Master the currency of combat. Own the battlefield on your terms.</em></p>
<h2><em>Build Your Team</em></h2>
<p><em>Work as a team to overcome the odds. Rogue Point is purpose-built to reinforce teamplay and pull players into the combat. You have to adapt, overcome, fight, and manoeuvre with your squad to win. Start with nothing more than a pistol and an armoured vest and earn an elite arsenal through successful missions and strategic team play.</em></p>
<h2><em>Risk VS Reward</em></h2>
<p><em>Rogue Point has teams taking risks not just on mission, but in the planning and loadout stages as well. Use the game's Dead Drop for a chance at getting the best gear, and specialized weapons you cannot get anywhere else.</em></p>
<h2><em>Weapons and Customization</em></h2>
<p><em>Complete missions to earn money and buy useful weapons and gear. Get the exact loadout you want or take a chance with a Dead Drop package to get gear.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>20+ Weapons with multiple skins</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>40+ Tactical Items and Attachments for your arsenal</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>60+ Cosmetic Items with multiple skins</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>24 Mission Layouts across 4 locations</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Endgame</em></h2>
<p><em>Campaign seems too easy? Well, put that to the test as you take on the ultra-hard Endgame Mission - a daunting challenge with tougher enemies and relentless action, pushing your team, your gear and your tactics to the limit! Put the exclamation point on your campaign</em>!</p>

The 55-inch is down to just $798, while the 65-inch is only $998.</p><p>These are the lowest prices ever for LG's B3 Series OLED TVs--and the best deals we've seen on OLED TVs in general all year. As such, we wouldn't be surprised if these offers sold out today. If you want one of them, you may want to forgo the gamble and spend $49 on a Walmart+ subscription. Even for the extra $49, these deals are awesome.</p><p>The 55-inch carried a retail price of $1,700, and the 65-inch was $2,400 when the B3 Series launched last year. Since these are last year's model, those prices are no longer representative of the normal going rate today. The 55-inch dropped down to $1,199 before it sold out at most retailers, while the 65-inch was $1,299 before going out of stock at other retailers.</p></div>                      </div><p>Aside from 10 inches of extra screen real estate on the 65-inch model, these TVs share the same specs. This includes an OLED display, 4K resolution, webOS smart TV platform, and impressive 120Hz refresh rates. They also support Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant. The B3 comes with LG's Magic Remote, a very nice remote with conventional inputs as well as motion and voice controls.</p><p>Both TVs use the α7 AI Processor Gen6, allowing them to automatically improve picture quality depending on what you’re watching. They’re good for gaming too, with a 0.1ms response time, Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR to reduce tearing. And if you have several consoles in your entertainment center, you'll be happy to know these TVs have four HDMI ports. Notably, two of the ports are HDMI 2.1, which helps you take full advantage of the graphical power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p><p>As mentioned, these LG OLED Smart TVs launched last year and have since been replaced by the B4 Series.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> is returning to the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> 6v6 format (and all of its original character abilities and maps) for a limited-time in an upcoming event mode Blizzard is calling Overwatch: Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It is basically as the name implies; from November 12 to December 2, Overwatch 1 will essentially be playable inside Overwatch 2. That means the mode will only feature the game's original roster of 21 heroes and their original abilities, on modes and maps from Overwatch 1. It also means that, at least for the first few days of the event, "there will be no hero limits and no role limits," as was the case when Overwatch first launched. After those first few days, a single hero rule per team will be enforced for the remainder of Overwatch: Classic, according to Blizzard's announcement <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBj4SCL4PNo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kBj4SCL4PNo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As Blizzard describes it, the event brings back the "chaotic" gameplay from Overwatch 1, complete with some of the roster's completely match-altering abilities, like Mercy's team-reviving Resurrect ultimate or Symmetra's powerful, map-spanning teleporters. It also means a return to friendly-fire, as D.VA and Junkrat will once again be able to harm themselves with their abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be a few differences between Overwatch 1 and Overwatch: Classic. For starters, loot boxes and the original Overwatch's UI aren't coming back, nor are the original, non-reworked versions of Overwatch's maps. Instead, it will use the reworked Overwatch 2 versions of the original Overwatch's 12 launch maps. Players also won't be able to use skins or cosmetics, even if they are from the original game, when playing Overwatch: Classic. Heroes will instead be restricted to their default appearance in Overwatch 1 for the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard had previously announced it would be testing a return to 6v6 for Overwatch 2, but Blizzard insists that Overwatch: Classic is not that. Additionally, Blizzard says it's not planning for Overwatch: Classic to be a one-and-done event and that it could return, even if it doesn't have much more to say at this time.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we're not planning for this to be a single event, we will be measuring player response to inform our future plans," Blizzard writes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's announcement of Overwatch: Classic further contributes to a trend of popular shooters, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex: Legends</a>, banking on the nostalgia players have for the launch versions of their favorite games. Fortnite is reportedly bringing back its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-returns-permanently-in-december-report/1100-6527620/" data-ref-id="1100-6527620">Fortnite OG game mode (feauring the game's original map and weapons) permanently</a> in December. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-devs-talk-lifelines-rebirth-season-23s-new-rocket-launcher-and-the-future-of-apex-legends/1100-6527578/" data-ref-id="1100-6527578">Apex: Legends' Season 23</a> introduced Launch Royale, a limited-time mode that brings back the game's original map, characters, weapons, and abilities much like Overwatch: Classic will.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 recently launched Season 13, which brought a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">PvP Halloween event</a> alongside major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-13-patch-notes-bring-big-changes-to-sombra-tank-updates/1100-6527210/" data-ref-id="1100-6527210">balance changes to heroes like Sombra</a> and some of the game's most popular tanks. As for when players can expect more 6v6 action, Blizzard says it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-will-roll-out-6v6-testing-during-season-14/1100-6527389/" data-ref-id="1100-6527389">conducting 6v6 tests during Season 14</a>, which begins on December 10. The first test will require a hero in each role, while a second test slated for later in the season will test out the "classic 2-2-2" role composition," with some tweaks.</p>

There are still many titles being released, but I feel that the era of games where the volume is the selling point is coming to an end.”</p><p> Nagoshi left the<em> Like a Dragon</em> publisher three years ago to set up his own studio, and is currently working on a new project with NetEase Games. As the new game enters full production, he said the team is currently deciding on the final estimate of how much content will be in it. It sounds like he’s steering away from just making it big for the sake of an impressive-sounding interview soundbite or back-of-the-box quote </p><p>“Of course we have the map, but the current version is so large that it’s almost too large,” he told Famitsu. “This time, while researching existing games, we started by making a fairly large map with roads and highways. Now we are gradually shrinking it down and exploring the best balance for the game.”</p><p>The size of a game’s map, the total length of its script, and the average runtime for players are often deployed in pre-release marketing campaigns to bolster the sense that a game is worth its asking price. Value is reduced to how long it will keep a player busy, rather than whether any of the stuff they are doing feels meaningful or fun. That might be a plus for people who just want two or three games that will occupy them all year long, but for everyone else it can make getting to the “good” parts of a game feel like working a second job. </p><p>We’ll see how much that philosophy ends up impacting Nagoshi’s next project. The last <em>Like a Dragon</em> he oversaw as an executive at Sega, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473">2020's <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em></a></span>, ran 45 hours on average, or over 100 for those seeking a completionist playthrough. I’m guessing whatever he reveals next won’t exactly be short either. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Blizzard has announced that 6v6 matches are coming back to Overwatch for a limited time with Overwatch: Classic. The — new? — mode launches November 12 for all players and will run to December 2.</p>



<p>The announcement came alongside a new teaser video for the mode showing the original cast of characters, game modes, and maps.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/YMrIozIBTl0GxGBZ.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>“Eight years ago, Blizzard released a completely new gaming world called Overwatch,” Blizzard said <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a blog post</a>. “Connected by a theme of fighting for the future, millions of you jumped in to experience new heroes like a time-jumping adventurer, an esports champion turned mech pilot, and a genetically-modified gorilla from the Moon.</p>



<p>“Now you’ll be able to relive the nostalgia in a series of new limited-time events in Overwatch 2, where you can experience the original heroes, abilities, and maps in the classic 6v6 team-based action you remember.”</p>



<p>Overwatch: Classic will see access to 21 characters from the original launch of the game. The mode takes players back to Overwatch 1.0 from May 2016 with classic abilities from the heroes. The heroes will be grouped into their original classes, but the mode will feature the No Hero Limits rule meaning you can have a full team of the same heroes.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, all 12 original maps will be available along with the four original game modes.</p>



<p>As far as if Overwatch: Classic is the way for Blizzard to bring 6v6 back permanently, the studio says not right now.</p>



<p>“We are running separate 6v6 test modes in future seasons to gather feedback and gauge player interest on that format,” Blizzard said.</p>



<p>What do you think of 6v6 matches coming back to Overwatch via Overwatch: Classic? Let us know in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> finally arrived in stores. And while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">the lack of a disc drive</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag have been unpopular with players</a>, Sony President Hiroki Totoki has assured investors that sales of the mid-generation console update haven't been negatively affected.</p><p>As noted by video game reporter <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1854839684054368505" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a>, Totoki recently told Japanese investors that, "In terms of the pricing, many people made different comments on that, but pricing on PS5 Pro has not had a negative impact, I don't think." He added that, "Hardcore users are the target of this hardware."</p><p>Considering that the PS5 Pro has barely been out a week, it seems premature to assess whether it's a success or a failure. What we do know is that PS5 Pro consoles appear to be readily available in stores, which means they haven't sold out. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lack-of-ps5-pro-shortages-means-some-scalpers-are-re-selling-at-a-loss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a> is also reporting that several scalpers have had to sell their PS5 Pros at a loss due to the lack of demand that accompanied the PS5 when it debuted in 2020. And as mentioned by Totoki, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-who-is-the-ps5-pro-for/1100-6526452/" data-ref-id="1100-6526452">PS5 Pro isn't geared towards the average player</a>.</p><p>However, the scalpers have reportedly had more success reselling the optional disc drive that can be added to the PS5 Pro. Several retailers have already sold out of the disc drive, which has given the scalpers an opportunity to fill the void until Sony can meet the demand. That suggests that there is a demand among the hardcore for a PS5 Pro that can play discs. Whether Sony will eventually release a PS5 Pro with a disc drive remains to be seen, especially since the company is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">making deals for PlayStation 6 manufacturing</a> down the line.</p>

Once there, the team splits into two groups as they make their way through the mission. Rook leads one group while you have to make the call between whether Davrin or Harding will lead the second team. This will take them out of your party selection for the duration of the mission and you’ll see them throughout the assault guiding the rest of your party and helping you from time to time. All of this culminates in a final fight with the elven god <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610">Ghilan’nain</a></span>, who nearly kills Rook in the scrap. However, the leader of the second team will create an opening to deal a killing blow to the god, only to be impaled by her and left to fall seemingly to their death.</p><p><strong>If you came here looking for a way to save Harding or Davrin, I’m sorry to report that it’s impossible</strong>. This isn’t a <em>Mass Effect 2</em> Suicide Mission moment, it’s an original <em>Mass Effect </em>Virmire decision. Harding and Davrin’s lives are mutually exclusive and whichever one you choose to lead the team will die by the end of the assault…presumably. When you return to the Lighthouse base, you can go to their respective rooms and examine some of their belongings. Rook will mention that there was “no trace” of whoever sacrificed themself for the cause, which could give BioWare an out to bring either character back in a future game. But whatever <em>Dragon Age </em>does in the future, <strong>you will lose Harding or Davrin for the remainder of the game</strong>, and if you romanced them you won’t see the culmination of that relationship.</p><p>There’s also another similar decision you make between Bellara and Neve that results in the character you choose getting captured by the elven gods. To be as spoiler-light as I can, I’ll just say you will be able to save them later in the game, but they will not rejoin your active party. So it’s not all bad!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s only fitting that NieR: Automata, one of the titles that inspired Stellar Blade initially, would enjoy a crossover with the action-packed PlayStation 5 exclusive. Directors Kim Hyung Tae and Yoko Tara, two long-time video game developers with deep respect for each other, join forces to bring console fans a collaboration unlike any other.</p>



<p>How does the NieR: Automata DLC work in Stellar Blade? According to the recent announcement, Emil from Emil’s Shop in NieR appears in Stellar Blade, selling eleven collab-specific items that somehow help combine both game worlds. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of the NieR: Automata DLC, Stellar Blade also receives a photo mode on November 20. The game’s upcoming photo mode allows you to pause the action at any point, snapping screenshots of Eve in various poses, expressions, landscapes, and even battle scenes for the ultimate action shot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There seems to be a brand-new side quest in the game that teaches you how to utilize the photo mode and rewards you with money and items upon completion. It’s an excellent way to introduce the mechanic and spark creativity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, on the same day as the photo mode and NieR: Automata DLC—November 20—a patch will launch simultaneously that includes additional appearance cosmetics, lip-sync language support, additional songs for camp, character customization, new battle mechanics, like auto-targeting and ballistics correction, and more!</p>

Players become a self-made detective in a world where reality and the surreal intertwine, diving into a series of missing person cases and uncovering hidden truths within the city.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Astrolabe Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Rusty Winter</em> is a game that is inspired by classic hard-boiled detective stories and good old urban legends. Set against the cold, industrial backdrop of the City of Ge’shan—a place echoing the faded glory of once-thriving industrial towns—the narrative unfolds as a romantic yet serious story infused with dark undertones and surreal twists. Using a delicate, richly-detailed pixel art style, the game brings every shadowed alley and forgotten corner of Ge’shan to life, as the protagonist unravel its strange mysteries one clue at a time.</p><p>The story revolves around a complex missing person case. Meet a cast of characters as diverse and worn as the city itself, and chase down leads that blurs the boundaries between reality and the paranormal. Uncover urban legends, and maybe even dive into some absurd extraterrestrial tales. Original music, vivid animations, and nostalgic mini-games enrich the journey across a decaying town on the brink of change. Along the way, witness the struggles of the townsfolk, catching glimpses of transformation—and perhaps even redemption.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

The story follows a self-made underdog detective driven by the search for a missing loved one, navigating shadowed streets, relying solely on instincts and determination in order to uncover the truth.</p><p>Explore many meticulously-crafted locations where realism intertwines with the surreal. Each scene is designed to draw deeper into the narrative, immersing in moments where time seems to stand still, and where memories resurface.</p><p><strong>Urban Legend: The Myth of the “Land <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a>“</strong></p><p>For many years, whispers have long circulated through Ge’shan about the Anunnaki—ancient celestial beings who once visited Earth and left behind a hidden relic in the icy reaches of the far north.</p><p>Locals speak of the “Land Beneath,” it surely isn’t about wealth or eternal life; it’s a key—a gateway to another world, an ultra-advanced utopia beyond human understanding. The devoted ones hold onto the belief that one day, the Anunnaki WILL RETURN.</p><p>As the city’s mysteries are unraveled, the line between the legend and reality itself begins to blur, and the myth of the Land Beneath becomes entwined with the detective’s own quest.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
