			<p>The Blue Protocol development team <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the free-to-play MMORPG will soon shut down in Japan. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in 2019, the game launched in Japan in Spring 2023. However, it didn't gather a large enough fanbase to keep going, and the live service is now scheduled to end on Saturday, January 18, 2025. The developers said they'll keep updating Blue Protocol with new stories until near the end, though.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on developer Bandai Namco Online Studios going insolvent a couple of months ago, which cast a long shadow on the scheduled global launch. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publisher</a> Amazon Games stopped referring to Blue Protocol's Western debut a while ago, and they have confirmed today that the launch outside Japan is not happening.</p>
<p><em><span>In their statement announcing the end of service, Bandai Namco Online said, “We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of BLUE PROTOCOL, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.” </span>We know this is disappointing news, and we share your disappointment. We love the world and characters of BLUE PROTOCOL, and we were excited to welcome players around the world into Regnas. We join Bandai Namco Online in expressing deep gratitude to the passionate fans who followed BLUE PROTOCOL development and participated in the Closed Technical Test.</em></p>
<p>Blue Protocol offered action-packed combat with five classes and lots of dungeons and raids to go through. The news is certainly disappointing for MMORPG fans, although Amazon remains highly committed to the genre, as evidenced by the imminent releases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a>&nbsp;(October 1, following a small delay) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-qa-amazon-confirms-amd-fsr-hdr-support-and-keyboard-mouse-option-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World Aeternum</a> (October 15), not to mention the ongoing work on The Lord of the Rings MMO, which however is still at an early stage of development.</p>

<p>Crysis Next was a developing free-to-play battle royale shooter set at the heart of the Crysis universe. It was penned to be a multiplayer-focused, third-person game that had years of work put into it before it was assumedly and quietly cancelled by Crytek. In 2020, rumours regarding the Crysis battle royale game started to surface, but this is one of the first occasions that we’ve seen gameplay leak.</p>



<p>Crytek, the series’ developer, has been issuing takedown notices against those uploading the content and sharing it online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>In the gameplay videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvCXa21r3Ug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcasing Crysis Next</a>, the cancelled battle royale project, we get a glimpse at a rudimentary multiplayer platform that looks as though it wasn’t too far into the development cycle.</p>



<p>It was never formally acknowledged by Crytek, and before the team had a chance to confirm it existed, Crysis 4 was announced. It has been around two years since the firm revealed that a new Crysis game sits on the horizon, and nothing more than a short teaser has been delivered, leaving fans to wonder what’s happening with the long-awaited sequel.</p>



<p>It has been more than a decade since the launch of Crysis 3, and players are hungry for more nanosuit-powered adventures.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Crysis Next, which was poised to take advantage of the battle royale boom, will never see the light of day. It had <strong>potential</strong>, giving players the ability to customise and control a powerful nanosuit and assume one of three roles: Frontliner, Tactician, and Flanker. It would have assumedly been a power-driven battle royale with large, open maps, but that’s mostly conjecture.</p>



<p>It’s not known <strong>when </strong>Crysis Next was cancelled, we just know that it <strong>was</strong>.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco and Amazon Games have jointly confirmed that Blue Protocol, an anime-inspired MMORPG, has been cancelled and will no longer see a global release. It was due to launch worldwide after being released in Japan, but Bandai Namco announced today that in January 2025, the game will be shut down entirely.</p>



<p>This news comes after almost a decade of development, with Amazon Games confirming in 2022 that it has been in the works since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-be-possible-to-provide-a-service-that-satisfies">‘Not Be Possible to Provide a Service that Satisfies’</h2>



<p>In a statement published on <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Bandai Namco website</a>, the shutdown of Blue Protocol was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We regret to inform you that the Japanese version of Blue Protocol will be discontinued on Saturday January 18, 2025.</p>



<p>As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games. We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.</p>



<p>We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.</p>



<p>We deeply apologize for the sudden announcement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Featuring sumptuous visuals, innovative character and enemy designs, and a semi-open-world environment, Blue Protocol had all the makings of a solid MMO. It impressed players during testing phases, and it was due to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in all markets next year.</p>



<p>It’s a sudden shock, but this live service game will be sunsetted in January 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Escape from Tarkov PvE Good, or Should You Stick to PvP?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-pve-good/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-tarkov-pve-good-or-should-you-stick-to-pvp.965622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-pve-good/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s relatively new PvE offering split the global community down the middle. On one side, you had the players falling in love with the fresh mode put forward by Battlestate Games, and on the other, there were the players that rebelled against it, stressing that it’s ‘not the point of Tarkov’.</p>



<p>I’ve been neck-deep in Escape from Tarkov PvE for several weeks, being one of the first players to access it by purchasing the controversial Unheard Edition of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>So, is Escape from Tarkov PvE good, or is it a complete waste of time?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-escape-from-tarkov-pve-worth-it">Is Escape from Tarkov PvE Worth It?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform offers almost everything that the primary PvP platform does, but it brings with it countless benefits. Firstly, your load times are almost completely eradicated, with some raids taking less than 20 seconds to load. That’s a huge win – especially when a wipe has just hit Escape from Tarkov and server queues are massive.</p>



<p>On that topic, that’s another advantage. In PvE, the game only wipes when you want it to – Battlestate Games doesn’t force it upon you. If you’re a slower player with less free time, this is a <strong>massive </strong>win, as it means you can progress through the game at your pace, hitting milestones that you never would have been able to if you were confined to the six-month wipe schedule that’s typically in Tarkov.</p>



<p>Many players have opted to jump into Tarkov PvE to avoid the plethora of cheaters that plague the main game. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov has an issue with cheaters, but they’re not there in the PvE environment, which means you’ll <strong>never </strong>be killed by a suspicious player.</p>



<p>And talking of other players, PvE is also cooperative, which means you can still enjoy a raid or two with friends to back you up.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-tarkov-pve-have-the-same-features-as-pvp">Does Tarkov PvE Have The Same Features as PvP?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov PvE offers <strong>everything </strong>that the core game does. It has the Flea Market, the Trader system, all the tasks, and even AI-powered PMC enemies and a full-fledged Hideout. The PMCs can be a little hard to manage at times and can be dramatically unpredictable, but overall, it’s such a similar experience to the PvP platform that you’ll often not notice the difference.</p>



<p>PvE in Tarkov still has Boss characters, every map is open, and the loot loop is identical. It’s possible to play the entire game through in PvE, and that includes the pesky tasks that require you to kill PMCs. Some are quite tough, such as the tasks to kill PMCs in specific areas, but it’s still doable.</p>



<p>The only <strong>real </strong>difference in Tarkov PvE is that you won’t run into other players, which makes for an easier and more enjoyable session as you are less likely to be blasted across the map by a sudden suppressed sniper shot that hits you out of nowhere. In Tarkov’s PvE mode,<strong> you </strong>are the only Chad.</p>



<p>Of course, that means you’re unlikely to get that huge feeling of satisfaction after winning an intense fight, but that’s a small price to pay.</p>



<p>If you’ve had Edge of Darkness or The Unheard Edition of Escape from Tarkov, you already have access to PvE. If you <strong>don’t </strong>have one of those versions, you can buy and keep PvE forever for just $20 from escapefromtarkov.com.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Escape from Tarkov PvE is fantastic and super enjoyable, and it has firmly brought me back into the Tarkov fold. I was put off for the longest time by the difficulty level, having less time to play, suffering from FOMO, and the cheaters that ruined the fun for everyone else.</p>



<p>Now I don’t have to worry about any of that – <strong>and </strong>my raids load in 30 seconds or less. What a huge win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Can Now Pre-Order The $700 Big Boss Statue From MGS3]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/big-boss-requiem-statue-preorder/</link>

<p>If you’re a die-hard Metal Gear Solid fan, you’ll need to step up and prove it by pre-ordering one of the most expensive statues to ever emerge based on the series. Priced at a <strong>minimum </strong>of $500, the Big Boss Requiem statue is one hell of a collectable, and at the most expensive tier, you’ll be parting ways with an eye-watering $700 to snag one.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic piece, though. The base statue recreates Big Boss’ iconic salute at the end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, but the ‘Definitive Edition’ of the statue also offers a string of props to really make the figure pop wherever you might choose to display it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-big-boss">Big Big Boss</h2>



<p>The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Big Boss Requiem statue was revealed last year, but it’s only now that it has become available to pre-order. It’ll be released late next year, and for fans of the franchise, it’s the ultimate collectable.</p>



<p>The statue, which stands at a whopping 55cm tall, has Big Boss saluting in front of the grave of his mentor, The Boss. There are three ‘tiers’ to this statue:</p>



<ol>
<li>Big Boss Requiem – This is just the base statue on a plinth</li>



<li>Big Boss Requiem Exclusive Edition – This is the base statue on a plinth, plus decorative props: a gravestone, flowers, and The Boss’ Patriot rifle in a case</li>



<li>Big Boss Requiem Definitive Edition – This top-tier version is the base statue, the decorative props, plus a ghostly visage of The Boss floating behind Big Boss</li>
</ol>



<p>Every statue will feature a limited edition numbering and an authentication card. It’s a massive piece, too – the topmost edition stands at 60cm tall and weighs almost 14 kg. It’s a solid resin statue with intricate details, and in images, it looks phenomenal. </p>



<p>It’s available to <a href="https://www.first4figures.com/big-boss-requiem-exclusive-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preorder from First4Figures</a>, which has previously released items such as a life-size bust of Solid Snake, huge statues based on Dark Souls bosses, and a massive range of high-quality statues pulled from the likes of Spyro, Darksiders, Gears of War, and <strong>many </strong>more.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in the Big Boss Requiem statue?</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Passion Republic Games [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/passion-republic-games">Passion Republic Games</a> will release <em><a title="Games > GigaBash [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/gigabash">GigaBash</a></em> downloadable content characters R.O.J.A.K and Balzarr on September 5 as part of the “Mighty” pack, the developer announced. <span id="more-909925"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via Passion Republic Games:</p><blockquote><p>This downloadable content adds two mighty original characters, R.O.J.A.K. and Balzarr, to the <em>GigaBash</em> universe. Each of them features unique movesets and abilities to dominate the arena!</p><ul><li><strong>Balzarr</strong> – Nicknamed the Demon Star, Balzarr is a new Titan that came to Earth from outer space as a blazing meteor. It is equipped with a powerful blade tail and high agility, which allows it to leap around the battlefield while cleaving its enemies into pieces. It can also enter its signature Predator Stance, allowing it to perch on walls and even on its own tail to unlock the use of more deadly abilities.</li><li><strong>R.O.J.A.K.</strong> – Five minds in one body; R.O.J.A.K. is a battle mech controlled by an uncoordinated team of Mighty Warriors serving as mankind’s last line of defense against Balzarr. Chomp down your foes with your T-Rex torso, kick enemies into the sky with your cannon-powered boots, snipe foes from afar with your Dragon arm, launch Durian bombs at your enemies, and more. Landing an attack with each body part will allow the pilots to synergize and activate the mech’s full potential.</li></ul><p>With the release of this new downloadable content release along with the past collaboration with the Tokusatsu genre titans such as Godzilla and Ultraman, <em>GigaBash</em> now has a grand total of 18 playable characters in its roster. So will you help the R.O.J.A.K. team protect humanity from this celestial invader, or will you play as Balzarr and unleash hell on Earth?</p></blockquote><p><em>GigaBash</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,815 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,883 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,098 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546400/GigaBash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/gigabash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-eric-barone-stardew-valley-crossover-with-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creator Eric Barone says there are no plans yet, but he's open to the idea of a collaboration with Fortnite.</h2></div><section><p>Stardew Valley is no stranger to nods to other games. Among other references, Patch 1.6 has a well-placed Terraria easter egg. Nevertheless, Stardew Valley has never really appeared in another games, though creator Eric Barone aka ConcernedApe definitely has some ideas in that front.</p><p>In a Discord conversation shared by Panedwards on X/Twitter, Barone talks about the possibility of a Stardew Valley collaboration, acknowledging that he's open to a crossover and saying that he would love to have Pam in particular in Fortnite.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The creator of 'Stardew Valley' aka <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ConcernedApe</a> has been trying to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FortniteGame</a> collaboration happen and is open to anything. <a href="https://t.co/wnaEfgIc5q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wnaEfgIc5q</a></p>— Panedwards (@Panedwards_YT) <a href="https://twitter.com/Panedwards_YT/status/1828161152817254710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"It doesn't have to be Pam though, I would be open to anything," Barone adds. "Abigail &amp; Sebatian could be good. Stardrop or Joja Cola item? Galaxy sword or slingshot?"</p><p>All of these items would be fun additions to Fortnite, and Stardew Valley's aesthetic is certainly in line with Epic's ultra-popular sandbox shooter. Pam would hardly look out of place next to Buff Peter Griffin, Solid Snake, and all the other Fortnite crossover characters. But could it actually happen?</p><p>Reached for comment, one of Barone's representatives acknowledged that the screenshot is real, but added a bit of additional context from ConcernedApe.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pam-stardew-valley-1724797104836.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pam would definitely be a monster in Fortnite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I have a small team of people who help me with Stardew updates, admin and business stuff. Sometimes, we play games together, and one game we enjoy playing is Fortnite (Zero Build). One time we were playing and someone said 'what if there was a Pam skin in Fortnite?' And it kind of became a meme for us, like we were imagining us all playing as a squad with identical Pam skins. It was just a silly fun idea," Barone explained in a statement sent to IGN. </p><p>"Then someone asked me if I would collab with Fortnite and I mentioned the Pam thing. There's nothing official in the works or anything like that, but yea we would find it amusing and fun if we were able to play as Pam (or any other Stardew character, really) someday. Other than the occasional gaming session, my team and I are completely focused on Stardew Valley development and ports right now."</p><p>Indeed, ConcernedApe has been busy recently amid the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">release of Patch 1.6</a> and ongoing work on the anticipated release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-haunted-chocolatier-developer-may-have-teased-the-return-of-a-beloved-stardew-valley-character">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Fans are still awaiting the release of Patch 1.06 on the Nintendo Switch, which failed to materialize during the Nintendo Direct earlier today. As for Fortnite, it's in the midst of its latest Marvel collaboration, having added <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-to-get-disney-villains-incredibles-characters-and-a-season-with-doctor-doom-d23-2024">Doctor Doom for Chapter 5 Season 4</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-ps5-version-requires-early-access-players-to-restart<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The size of AAA games these days means bugs are almost inevitable, especially in open-world games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. Whether it's a graphical glitch, a stuttering line, or something more serious, everyone has stories of running into bugs, and sometimes fixing those can be problematic for developers.</p>
<p>In a message sent out to <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> PS5 players, Ubisoft has apologized to those who "had access to an older version of the game", as they might be encountering issues after the most recent update on PlayStation 5. In the letter, they tell players to make sure they've updated to the latest version (1.000.002 as of the time it was sent), and to start a new save as if they continue on a prior save they will "unfortunately face issues and progression blockers."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws.jpg?itok=ypZeWHAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws.jpg?itok=kjWpQJFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image Credit: Andreas Lopez</figcaption></figure><p>While journalists and influencers are used to issues from testing games heading up to release, including needing to restart, what makes <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> different here is that it follows the increasingly popular trend of AAA games to allow early access to players who pay more for a special edition that lets them play the game up to three days later. Thus, players who paid a premium to get their hands on <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> just a bit earlier are losing their progression, and time spent in the game because Ubisoft failed to ensure that the version released was ready for its effective actual launch date.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has received largely positive reviews, including our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Star Wars Outlaws Review"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> review</a> by Erren Van Duine, but this highlights a problem with this model of release, where major publishers are releasing these games as completed with essentially two separate release dates. Here, we see these premium-paying players losing saves they made during that time so far. Electronic Arts has used the same period to help <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/madden-nfl-25-review-limits-ea" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="New Madden’s lack of launch week review scores was partially by EA’s design">shield <em>Madden</em> from reviews</a>, by not letting reviewers publish their reviews until after the early access period was up and it reached the second, 'official', release date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-owe-money.jpg?itok=IBF7QDdr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-owe-money.jpg?itok=eSjXBAbS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This might be how some <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> players on PlayStation are feeling after they ponied up for the pricier versions</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from the first time that Ubisoft has faced issues with bugs in their games. Most famously would be with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ubisoft addresses every known Assassin's Creed Unity glitch and workaround"><em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em></a>, which became notorious for its wide variety of glitches, so much so that a decade later it's still a byword for it. However, even that game didn't reach the heights of Ubisoft's worst bug, which came in 2001 with <em>Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor</em>, a <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> RPG that when you went to uninstall it, the game would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011126120955/https://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q4/pool_of_radiance/pool-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor Ars Technica Review">uninstall system files on your computer.</a></p>
<p>As for now, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appears poised to join the <em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order"><em>Fallen Order</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review"><em>Jedi Survivor</em></a> as substantial modern single-player additions to the rich <em>Star Wars </em>video game history. Even if it is making life harder on those who tossed in some extra credits to play early.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation 5 is becoming even more expensive in Japan, in an announcement made by Sony on the <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese PlayStation blog</a>. This price hike comes after "the recent challenging external environment, including the current fluctuations in the global economic situation, and the impact it will have on our business."&nbsp; With the current state of PlayStation's finances across the globe, the price hike isn't too surprising. However, it is a relatively drastic price rise for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-61-7-million-units/">PlayStation 5</a> overall. Regardless of what edition of the console people buy, they will now have to fork out an extra $90 in Yen.</p>
<p>For those who still want to get a PlayStation 5 and live in Japan, now would be the time, as the price rise for the console goes into effect as of September 2. The disc edition of the PlayStation 5 will be going from ¥66,980 (~$465) to ¥79,980 (~$550), which is a stark increase. It's no better for the digital edition of the PlayStation 5, as the price of that edition is going from ¥59,980 (~$417) to ¥72,980 (~507).</p>
<p>Compared to other consoles, PlayStation 5 is the only one that hasn't seen any form of a price decrease over the years, except for decreases when the console is on a temporary sale. Even then, the sales don't happen often, so it's slim to none that people will actually be able to get the console at a reasonable price. While Sony is said to be doing this due to the world's economic climate right now, it most likely won't go over very well by raising the price of the console. It's now made it even more unobtainable for people to get, compared to an Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch, which is significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>Since launch, the PlayStation 5 has seen multiple price hikes in Japan specifically, with both the disc and digital edition receiving significant price rises. Since the release of the console, both editions have seen a total price rise of $210~ and $225, respectively, compared to other countries that haven't seen price rises as significant. However, when the console first received a price rise in Japan, the UK and Europe experienced price increases. Whether the same will happen this time round remains to be seen.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't stop there. Sony has also confirmed that the accessories for the PlayStation 5 will also be experiencing price rises. For example, Dualsense Wireless Controllers and the PlayStation VR2 will all become pricier in Japan as of September 2. Whether the accessories will experience a price increase globally will remain to be seen until the price hikes are officially enforced in Japan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/spiders-mismanagement-strike-minecraft-greedfall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To hear French game dev union STJV tell it, workers at Spiders – the studio behind flawed but consistently-ambitious role-playing games like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Steelrising</em>, and <em>The Technomancer</em> – are not having a good time right now. Today the union <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an open letter to management</a> alleging a litany of deal-breaking issues at the company, which has been signed by 44 out of 95 Spiders staffers. Next week the studio will go on strike – (partially) in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>STJV says that Spiders workers previously went on strike in January, but conditions within the studio continued to deteriorate. The letter covers “several” years’ worth of issues, including “instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, [and] refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.”&nbsp;</p><p>STJV added: “We had demanded that the head of the company receive a delegation of Spiders’ workers to discuss all these points. She accepted, the delegation came to a meeting on August 27, and then waited in vain for the management to come, which it never did.”</p><p>As a result, Spiders workers are going on strike starting on September 2. They plan to picket outside the company’s offices in Paris and – in what I believe is a first for this kind of thing – also in <em>Minecraft</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“In particular, we will be organizing pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a <em>Minecraft </em>server created for the occasion,” STJV wrote. “We are inviting our relatives, friends, supporters, workers in the industry in general, journalists, and political actors to join us at the pickets.”</p><p>Aftermath will of course be on the scene bringing you all the latest updates. In <em>Minecraft</em>, at least.</p><p><em>Thanks to Aftermath subscriber Kaile Hultner for tipping us off about this one!</em> <em>If you'd like to join our Discord, you can do so by subscribing <a href="http://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What makes the Lego games fun, apart from their players' affinity for colorful blocks, is the lighthearted tone inherent in translating the stories of various movies into toy form.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/funko-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-569178">Funko Fusion</a> has a lot of surface similarities with Lego's takes on video games, and the main one is a similarly comedic take on a lot of subject matter. Where Lego generally skews young, however, Funko Fusion, like the vinyl Pop toys the game is based on, wants to attract an older audience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Funko Fusion Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At the top level, Funko Fusion is a 3D action-platformer using the Funko Pop art aesthetic and combining a bunch of different properties--mostly Universal Pictures movies, but with additions like He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Mega Man mixed in, as well. There's an overarching story in which an evil, gooey vinyl guy named Eddie starts possessing and mutating Funko toys to turn them into monsters, but the gist is that you travel between the "worlds" of different characters, finding yourself plopped into their movies, games, or TV shows, as they're altered because of Eddie's influence.</p><p dir="ltr">I played 20 minutes of Funko Fusion at a recent Xbox Gamescom event in Los Angeles, which focused on a level based on Jurassic World. The level gave a brief glimpse of the kind of humor Funko is going for. In the opening cutscene for the level, I watched a giant, possessed dinosaur toy--the Indominus Rex from the first Jurassic World--chomp a few random vinyl park-goers and InGen corporate security guys. In the next moment, as the Funko Pop versions of Jurassic World protagonists Owen and Claire (played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in the movies) fled from the loose dinosaurs now overrunning the park, Claire got her giant Funko Pop head trapped in the closing double-doors of a gift shop. That's a pretty good indication of the tone that developer 10:10 Games is going for.</p><p dir="ltr">"The major thesis of the game was, action platformers are great, people really love these types of games, and then, for no good reason whatsoever, the genre abandons them once they get to a certain age--and we can do better," Jason Bischoff, Funko's vice president of licensing and business development, told me in an interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Bischoff said the developers of Funko Fusion targeted a T rating from the start of development for a few different reasons. First, the group of people who tend to be interested in and collect Funko Pop toys skews older--there are younger people who buy them, too, but among the huge number of licensed properties represented in the toys are many that are pretty old and would generally only appeal to older fans. Second, Bischoff said, the game is full of "Itchy and Scratchy-like violence," referencing the often-gross and over-the-top in-universe cartoon of The Simpsons, and that required a T rating. And finally, there were the particular licensed properties Funko and the game's developers wanted to include that were often a lot more adult than one might expect for a toy-focused game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358155"></a><figcaption>Dinosaurs look kinda cute as Funko toys, but they were pretty deadly in the demo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358155-funkofusionjurassicworld4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those properties include John Carpenter's The Thing, the 1982 horror film that's full of disgusting body-horror monsters. Funko and 10:10 Games released a demo for Funko Fusion on Steam that takes players into its levels based on The Thing, adding some comedy to that film's story by converting its gross, twisted mutant monsters to the Funko aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">What's probably the main draw of Funko Fusion, at least for people who aren't already excited about the Funko brand, is the breadth of different properties included. Bischoff said there are 21 different properties tied into the game but hinted that there are plenty of secret characters and maybe even worlds for players to find, too. The list is as weird as it is impressive, including The Thing, Jurassic World, 1999's The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiss, the Jordan Peele-directed Nope, Edgar Wright's genre comedies Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the 1978 Battlestar Galactica TV series, the foul-mouthed murderous possessed doll Chucky, Jaws, Back to the Future, Voltron, and Netflix's The Umbrella Academy.</p><p dir="ltr">The short look at the Jurassic World level I played gave a quick sense of the moment-to-moment gameplay of Funko Fusion, especially when compared to the Steam demo. It seems you can expect, at least at the start of the world, to get mission objectives that have you exploring a large space as you gather collectibles or kill specific enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">In Jurassic World, the first part of the level is playing out the moment from the film in which all the dinosaurs get loose, focusing mostly on pteranodons swooping down to harass fleeing park guests. You're let loose in the large outer area of the park, which is littered with gift shops and restaurants, with the goal of searching for and shooting five loose dilophosaurus. The spitting dinosaurs have a tendency to run when you threaten them, which can make it tough to track them all down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358156"></a><figcaption>Each world gives you a choice of different characters from its story, each with their own abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358156-funkofusion-jurassicworld2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the start of the level, you can pick one of four characters--Owen, Claire, Barry, or Kayla (the latter played by Omar Sy and DeWanda Wise in the films). Each has a different main weapon and melee attack, and different capabilities, making them good at different ranges. Owen has a dodge roll and a slower-firing, more powerful rifle, for example, while Claire rolls and carries a faster assault rifle. Barry has a shotgun, but instead of a dodge roll, he gets a shield he can pull out to protect him from damage. There are puzzles in the level that require a certain character to access, and you can quickly swap to any of the other characters whenever you find a Funko Pop box.</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from your main goal, though, you're also free to explore the area to solve puzzles and search for secrets, of which there are a ton. Each level has a bunch of optional objectives to find, like hidden "crown" items that are a lot like the stars of various Mario games--you're putting them toward a larger goal that stretches across all the worlds. You can also find items that let you power up different mold machines to unlock new gear. In Funko Fusion, everything runs on vinyl, and you can earn bits of vinyl from smashing items, beating enemies, and opening treasure chests scattered everywhere. You can then spend that vinyl at mold machines to craft stuff like soda drinks that heal you or give you temporary buffs, new weapons like a grenade launcher or minigun, or environmental items like a bounce pad that can get you to locations you couldn't otherwise reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Putting the focus on vinyl as the lifeblood of the game is how 10:10 Games was able to make He-Man and Mega Man fit with Shaun of the Dead and Jaws, Bischoff said, in the same way that physical Funko toys act to unify those different stories and characters. Everything in the world is made of vinyl, and that gave the developers the ability to unify cartoonish worlds with those in which a character occasionally gets dismembered, bringing both together to a funny tonal middle ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358160"></a><figcaption>The Funko approach takes some intense, often gory stories, like The Thing, and makes them funny through the lens of the toys.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358160-funkofusionthething.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo gave me the sense that, in order to complete a few of the puzzles I ran into, I'd need to return to these worlds later when I had access to new crafting blueprints gained from other locations. And as mentioned, you sometimes need specific characters, including ones that aren't native to that particular world. I couldn't open a specific gold door in the Jurassic World level during the demo, but when I later played the Steam demo, I discovered how to clear it: by finding and using He-Man to knock the door down with his sword. Opening the door in The Thing world uncovered a new puzzle that required a different character to solve and was tied to the Battlestar Galactica characters. So it seems there will be lots of different ways the worlds can interact with each other, both from a story standpoint and through secrets you can unlock along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">You're encouraged to use different characters, and Funko Fusion will include more than 60, but you're not required to. If you've got a particular character you love, you can stick with them and the crafting system will help you make sure you don't miss out on anything, Bischoff said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Let's just say you're the world's biggest Orko fan," he said, referencing the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe character. "If you want to play Orko top to tail, you can do that. The mold machines ultimately will allow you to craft the wacky weapons or other supplementary gadgets to basically backfill the special abilities that Orko does not have."</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the Jurassic World demo was concerned with combat, and there were plenty of dinosaurs to fight. In addition to those five dilophosaurus and the pteranodons pestering everyone, there were points when the park was suddenly full of fast, deadly velociraptors. These guys would sometimes leap out of bushes in ambush, or come charging at you in large groups, taking a lot of fire to bring down. Staying alive can be tough, with a lot of scrambling combat that uses your dodge and shield and dumping lots of bullets into enemies to bring them down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358154" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358154"></a><figcaption>We only saw the earliest part of the Jurassic World level, which looks to loosely follow the story of the films.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358154-funkofusion-jurassicworld.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Apart from the dinosaurs, I also ran into InGen security teams wielding guns of their own. Approaching the Jurassic World Information Center, the passageway deeper into the park, I was attacked by a bunch of gun-wielding enemies, with a sniper on top of the building throwing down explosive grenades to make things even more hectic. There's a lot of gunplay in the game, and despite the fact that everyone looks like a vinyl toy with a big head, you're frequently blowing off their heads, burning off their vinyl skin, and rendering them into toy skeletons. Packing health items is essential because you're going to take a lot of damage; the enemies in Funko Fusion are definitely coming for you.</p><p dir="ltr">When I finally found all five dilophosaurus, cleared the way to the Information Center, and obtained the key to open it, I was treated to a velociraptor ambush and then another of Funko Fusion's typical puzzles. This one required powering up the door in order to exit into the next area. It requires tracing a power line from the switch back to its power source, which you need to charge up with a battery. The line itself also had breaks in it that needed fuses to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">The trick here was to identify different items around the room that <em>didn't</em> need power and pilfer the parts from those to fix the door switch. A nearby vending machine, which you can use to nab power-ups, was powered by a battery you could snag from it--but ideally, after you'd already gotten the consumable items you needed. Fuses were also hidden around the room, powering things like neon signs and holographic dinosaur displays. Once those were plugged in, the switch opened, and I was able to race out into the next area, although I didn't see much more before the demo ended.</p><p dir="ltr">What's a little more obvious in the Steam demo, which isn't timed, is the overall tone of Funko Fusion. That demo covers what appears to be the beginning of the game, setting up the plot in which Freddy Funko, a vinyl character who Bischoff described as "the world's biggest fan," a 10-year-old boy, and the newish owner of the Funko factory that produces all the toys, is attacked by his evil antithesis, Eddie Funko.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358161" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358161"></a><figcaption>Funko Fusion incorporates a lot of surprising movie franchises, including Shaun of the Dead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4358161-funkofusionshaunofthedead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Eddie quickly possesses the first character you meet, a cute talking fox who works with Freddy, and turns him into a giant, misshapen fiend. Killing a friendly character turned into a hulking monster is a surprising start to a game like this and casts the whole experience as a goofy but self-aware and potentially dark comedy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Almost right out the gate when you start the title, when you meet Eddie for the first time, we knew that we wanted to give a voice to all the 'haterade' out there, right?" Bischoff said. "Because if Freddie is the Richie Cunningham, what is the opposite of that? Like an evil Fonz. So that's kind of who Eddie Funko is. And literally, we have taken quotes that we've been hearing for years from folks that aren't necessarily big Funko advocates, or maybe they're Funko critics--like Eddie literally says, 'This dead-eyed, misshapen form.' Some of the other bigger critics and their voices, the things that they've said through the years, we wanted to give that stuff a voice, to pit these two ideas against one another over the course of this adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of delving into different movie worlds, several of which have never been brought to games before, is the thing that interests me most when it comes to Funko Fusion. In playing both demos, though, I was surprised by the density of the game's levels. They seem littered with small side objectives, secrets, puzzles, and Easter eggs that make them worth exploring, and I'm fascinated to see how the game will approach stories and franchises that haven't gotten this kind of attention in the video game space before.</p><p dir="ltr">Funko Fusion is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on September 13, and on Nintendo Switch and PS4 on November 15.</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced a significant price hike for PlayStation 5 in Japan, which will see the cost of the standard and Digital Editions of the console rise by ¥13,000 (around £70).
</p>
<p>
Announcing the news in a <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/">post on its Japanese PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony blamed the price hike (as per Google Translate) on "the recent challenging external environment, including the current fluctuations in the global economic situation, and the impact it will have on our business".
</p>
<p>
When its new prices come into effect on 2nd September, the disc version of PlayStation 5 will increase from ¥66,980 (around £350) to ¥79,980 (around £420). As for the disc-free Digital Edition, it'll see its price rise from ¥59,980 (£314) to ¥72,980 (£380).

<p>
Sony's new price points for PlayStation 5 aren't the first time the company has chosen to increase the cost of PlayStation 5 in Japan. The standard console was originally priced at ¥49,980 when it released back in 2020, while the Digital Edition cost ¥39,980 - making for an increases of around £160 and £170 respectively since launch.
</p>
<p>
Sony's announcement has also confirmed price bumps for a wide range of PlayStation accessories in Japan too, with the likes of DualSense Wireless Controllers and PlayStation VR2 all set to be more expensive from 2nd September.
</p>
<p>
Sony last increased the cost of Japanese PS5s back in 2022, which was accompanied by a £30/€50 price hike for the console in the UK and Europe, bringing the price to £480/€550 for the standard edition and £390/€450 for its Digital Edition counterpart. There's no indication its latest Japanese price hike will be mirrored in any other territories.
