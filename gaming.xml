			<p>Rocket Racing is reintroducing Inferno Island, with players being able to participate in Casual Racing, a new game mode. This allows players to take part in the Rocket Racing event without high stakes and have a relaxing time. Along with this update comes five brand-new Epic-made tracks, with two additional tracks created by 404 Creative.</p>
<p>The Casual Racing around Inferno Island has a hand-crafted playlist where players of all skill levels can mingle and participate in races together without worrying about trying to come first or with the pressure of it affecting your rank. These races are also a great way to ease yourself into the game before you start participating in ranked games.</p>
<p>Rank resets are coming, with the new ranks being based on your final ranking during the season. At the time of writing, players can now begin to participate in quests and challenges across <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-cursed-sails-event-now-live/">Fortnite</a> and Rocket League in the Summer Road Trip to work their way up to unlocking the Tesla Cybertruck.</p>
<p>For those playing Fortnite and planning on taking the Tesla Cybertruck for a spin, you'll have to complete quests to get the Tesla Cybertruck bundle and the Summer Road Trip <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-in-fortnite-by-goin-on-a-summer-road-trip-with-the-squad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Baja Off-Road Decal for the Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>
<p>From July 23 through to July 31, there will be unique quests and challenges to complete daily. Nine quests must be completed, but you will have until August 3 to complete them all to unlock the rewards. By completing the quests for the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite, you'll gain access to rewards such as the Underworld Camo Wrap, Sun Sign Back Bling, and Beast Mode Cybertruck Boost.</p>
<p>For those getting stuck into <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-on-a-rocket-league-summer-road-trip">Rocket League</a>, there are three challenges players need to participate in to unlock the Tesla Cybertruck bundle for themselves. Challenge one begins on July 23 and finishes on August 6. Challenge two starts on July 26 and finishes on August 6. Finally, the third challenge begins on July 31 and finishes on August 6.</p>
<p>If you decide to participate in the Rocket League Summer Road Trip, you can unlock a multitude of decals for your brand-new Tesla Cybertruck. In addition, if you miss out on the event, you can purchase the decals from the item shop for a limited time between August 7 and August 21, except for the Baja Off-Road Decal. The challenges for both games are relatively simple, with most of them asking you to participate in a certain number of games or earn a specific amount of XP.</p>
<p>The Baja Off-Road Decal is exclusively earned by completing the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite or Rocket League.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-content-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-arrives-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the game is getting "a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2%E2%80%99s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed.934968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Overwatch 2's first Mythic weapon skin has been revealed and is officially coming to Overwatch 2 today. The first Mythic weapon skin goes to Reinhardt, titled the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin. This cosmetic is now available for purchase in the Mythic Shop. To give the weapon some flair, it reacts to every movement and swing of the weapon you make, coming alive in the hands of Reinhardt.</p>
<p>When you get a kill, the smoldering weapon will erupt into flames, giving the idea that the player is constantly satiating the demon lurking within every single time they attack successfully or kill an enemy. For those who want to appear more dangerous on the battlefield, picking up this cosmetic is a great way to go about it, especially if you want to see your foes burst into flames when you eliminate them with your weapon.</p>
<p>The Mythic Skin has multiple purchase options, with the ability to purchase the base Mythic skin for 50 Mythic Shards, equivalent to $39.99, which is pretty pricey for just a single weapon skin, primarily since Mythic Shards can only be obtained through the Premium Battle Pass. You can then unlock three varying levels of effects on the weapon. For example, you can get a special weapon flourish or elimination effects and reactive effects if you want to show off your skill with the weapon and intimidate your foes.</p>
<p>For a limited time, the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle can unlock the base Mythic skin for Reinhardt's weapon, along with 2,000 Overwatch Coins and 20 Battle Pass Tier Skips.</p>
<p>"Our initial thought was to have the theme be magma, but once I started concepting, I decided to add a creature to make the weapon fiery and alive. Eventually, we landed on Bound Demon, a cursed axed that glows with hellfire," explains <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/24104604/unleash-your-inner-demon-with-reinhardt-s-mythic-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angela Song</a>, the concept artist for the Mythic Weapon. For the flourish of the weapon, a lot of thought went into how to make it threatening. "We wanted a smooth animation that the player can constantly spam. Reinhardt jovially tossing and flipping his weapon felt like a natural fit. It suits his personality and encourages the player to spam it," says Angela Song.</p>
<p>While this is the first Mythic Weapon skin to be released, plenty is on the horizon. New Mythic Weapon skins will be available in each <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/">new season of Overwatch 2</a>, allowing more players to show off their flair on the battlefield with each new Mythic Weapon added to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/how-crow-country-captured-the-survival-horror-energy-of-1996/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The year is 1996. I’m home from middle school, and my friends and I have walked to the closest house—mine—before dinner. The daily ritual is to grab one bag of chips (usually Doritos) and one soda (often Mountain Dew) from the garage. My friend Matt could not be trusted, which is why my mom eventually put a sign in the garage reminding everyone to grab one of each. I am pretty sure he was still grabbing at least a second bag of chips and hoping no one noticed.</p><p>Snacks and beverages in hand, we’d head upstairs and sit down in front of the television to play video games. Sometimes, we’d play <em>GoldenEye </em>and scream at one another for clearly looking at another person’s screen to gain an advantage. Other times, we’d beat the crap out of one another in rounds of <em>Tekken</em>. This time, everyone was waiting with baited breath because I had a copy of <em>Resident Evil</em>, billed as a very scary new video game for the original PlayStation.</p><p>We were, I should note, all 11 years old. A perfect situation.</p><p>I distinctly remember turning the infamous L-shaped corner in the early hours of Resident Evil, the one where <em>you-know-what </em>jumps through the window when you least expect it. I did not expect it. My friends did not expect it. And my mom, running to the room to see why everyone was screaming, also did not expect it. As I frantically emptied my clip into the zombie dog that had rudely burst onto the scene, our terror turned to laughter. What was behind the next door?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OaXfg8tMK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Resident Evil 1 (Playstation 1) Original Trailer/Commercial"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>www.biohazard1.com is an incredibly funny name for a website. It no longer exists.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>That, in a nutshell, is the magic of early survival horror games.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Crow Country </em>is a game from 2024 trying to capture the energy of 1996, about the story of a creepy theme park that, of course, has suddenly closed. Who could say why? More specifically, it’s after the energy of survival horror games from that era, an energy the genre has been chasing since. It’s the era of the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and other defining games.</p><p>The difference between then and now is that <em>Resident Evil</em>’s developers didn’t know they were outlining a genre. Its designers, like its eventual players, were fumbling in the dark. <em>Crow Country</em>’s designer and writer, Adam Vian, has hindsight. What does it mean to make a game inspired by works from 30 years ago that clicks for those burdened by nostalgia <em>and</em> people under the age of 30? What elements of survival horror are crusty mechanics that need to be updated for the modern age, versus intrinsic crustiness that makes survival horror work at all?</p><p>To learn more, I asked Adam to answer a few questions about what defines a genre, what it means to play with genre conventions and expectations, and why <em>Crow Country </em>became a hit.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Got some real LONGLEGS on ya, pal? Ha ha ha. This reference will still make sense in a few years, right?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: <em>Crow Country </em>has proved very popular, but is it surprisingly popular? Has its success taken you by surprise at all?</strong></p><p>Adam Vian: I was cautiously optimistic before release, but the response has been beyond anything we could have reasonably hoped for. Numbers-wise, it's the most successful game release we've ever had. But it was seeing all the amazing fanart (and cosplay) in the first couple of weeks really drove home the reality of the game's popularity. Looking on Twitch and seeing a whole screen full of streamers all streaming the game at the same time—that was a very surreal moment for me. I saved a screenshot of it, in case I ever start to doubt it really happened.</p><p><strong>Naturally, you’d guess it’s old school survival horror fans, but is that too simplistic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adam: Yeah, it's had a wider reach. Old school survival horror fans really like<em> Crow Country</em>, but before we added the hard mode, they mostly found it pretty easy. Perhaps too easy. Despite that issue however, they still seemed to have a great time with it, and it often got labelled as a great entry-point for players looking to discover the genre. 'My first survival horror game'. And I'm fine with that! It definitely seems to have worked out for us—a lot of players who are younger or less experienced with the genre have discovered the game and loved it.</p><p><strong>What is your definition of survival horror, and how does that apply to what <em>Crow Country’</em>s definition of survival horror is?</strong></p><p>Adam: My personal definition of survival horror probably starts and ends with the format laid out by <em>Resident Evil 1.</em> It's about navigating an unfolding (Metroidvania-like) space, unlocking new areas by solving puzzles and finding inventory items - all while enemies are trying to attack you. And, of course, you have limited resources with which to deal with the enemies.</p><p>When making the <em>Crow Country </em>pitch deck, I had a slide about the inspiration I was taking from PS1-era survival horror games—and it included a list of characteristics I wanted to aim for:</p><ol><li>A rich atmosphere.</li><li>A strong, tangible sense of place.</li><li>A small (but memorable) cast of characters.</li><li>Meaningful exploration.</li><li>Engaging puzzle design.</li><li>A mixture of tension and tranquility.</li></ol><p>So, I suppose these are the things I value most in these kinds of games. Or, perhaps, this is a list of things I'm often disappointed to not find in many modern horror games—and thus, things I wanted to make sure my game had. (Perhaps that's why this list doesn't mention combat?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>They don't make weirdly evocative and highly confusing box art like this these days.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>I heard someone describe <em>Crow Country</em> as a game that tries to match your memory of what it was like to play a survival horror game, rather than what it was actually like. Does that feel philosophically accurate?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adam: Yeah, I'd agree with that. It wasn't a mantra I spoke aloud at any point, but because I made the game entirely by feeling my way through the process, it makes sense. Like when you draw something from memory, your drawing might look more like how that thing feels to you, compared to how it actually looks.</p><p>The graphics are one aspect where this is definitely the case. I don't actually think <em>Crow Country </em>looks like any kind of PlayStation 1 game—not if you compared them directly. But it feels like it does, and that's all that matters.</p><p><strong>I love that the game lets you toggle between tank controls and “modern” controls. But even offering modern controls is a choice, a concession to modern sensibilities. There’s a lot of that throughout <em>Crow Country.</em> How did you balance trying to meet people where they are, versus maintaining, I don’t know, some sense of “purity” about what a “survival horror” game is—or isn’t?</strong></p><p>Adam: Originally, the game only had tank controls. It didn't occur to me to include modern controls. But even back then, I noticed something interesting - tank controls feel good on a d-pad, but they feel bad on an analog stick. And, vice versa for modern controls. And since most people just use the analog stick by default, it meant they'd be using the bad-feeling tank controls.</p><p>Eventually, I got some negative feedback about the tank controls, and I decided to add modern controls. And so I was able to solve my problem by mapping modern controls onto the stick, and tank controls on the d-pad. This means you have both at the same time! I was proud of myself for 'inventing' such a clever solution, until I realised that the HD Remaster of <em>Resident Evil 1</em> <em>Remake </em>did the same thing.</p><p>It's so funny to me that people often compliment <em>Crow Country</em> for allowing you to rotate the camera. Like it's some interesting, unique feature. It's standard in pretty much all 3rd person games!! But because the game resembles <em>Resident Evil 1 </em>or whatever, being able to rotate the camera apparently comes as a pleasant surprise.</p><p>The one thing I was really worried about was not having any checkpoints or auto-saves. It's rare these days to have to manually save your game or otherwise risk losing progress. I was worried people would complain this was archaic, unacceptable in the modern landscape. But it ended up working out just fine, people seem happy to use the save rooms. (Although, I suspect this was helped by the fact that the game isn't that difficult—people weren't dying very much.)</p><p>In terms of old-school mechanics I avoided...the game doesn't use limited saves or limited inventory space. Both of these are fairly specific to <em>Resident Evil</em>, as<em> Silent Hill</em> doesn't use them either. That said—I want to explore both, next time.</p><p><strong>The game offers a story mode, a way to walk through the environment without the fear of death. Were you actively crafting the game knowing “hey, this room needs to still be interesting if someone isn’t popping zombies”?</strong></p><p>Adam: Years ago I'd seen a tweet from someone asking if there was a mod that removed the monsters from <em>Silent Hill</em>. In their words: “I just love being there.”</p><p>I was about halfway through <em>Crow Country</em>'s development, and I just thought... why not? There are a lot of people who have decided they can't/won't play horror games - because they're too stressful, or whatever. But they'd probably love a spooky puzzle adventure game.</p><p>And this goes back to my previous answer about my personal definition for survival horror. It so happens that all my favourite aspects of these games are things that would still be fully present in a non-combat mode—the atmosphere, the exploration, the puzzles, the characters. So (even if I hadn't realised it at first) from the beginning I'd been crafting a game that would be engaging even with the enemies turned off.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySQJrV2girk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast Preview trailer"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>There are soooooo many weird things Capcom will have to update for Code Veronica X.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Do you have a favorite survival horror game, and why isn’t it <em>Resident Evil: Code Veronica X</em>? I know that game has, in many ways, aged poorly. But that transition to proper 3D remains such a defining moment of my own relationship with survival horror.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You know, I recently replayed <em>Code Veronica X</em>. I'd only played it once before, when I was a teenager. On my revisit, I found myself liking the game a lot. Over the course of my playthrough, I went from “Capcom shouldn't remake this one” to “I'd be totally fine if Capcom remade this one.” I think it's got some really cool stuff in it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it's a really cruel game. I lost out on the magnum due to no fault of my own. And then I lost all my best weapons and ammo in a character-switching story beat that I didn't know was about to happen. So, the end result was that I didn't have enough ammo to defeat the final boss. I literally just had to give up! You can bet they'll sand off those rough edges if it does end up getting a remake.</p><p>(For the record, the game Capcom should remake next is <em>Dino Crisis</em>.)</p><p>My favourite survival horror game is <em>Silent Hill 3</em>. I think it's the scariest, with the heaviest atmosphere. The rest of my top 5 would be <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> (classic), <em>Resident Evil 1</em> (remake) and <em>Parasite Eve 2</em>. And... an honourable mention to <em>Haunting Ground</em>.</p>

Both games dole out a story through journal entries and environmental storytelling but the majority of your time in <em>Riven </em>is spent in silence undisturbed by dialogue. What <em>Riven </em>uses to fill that constant silence is an expansive soundscape that paints a sonic portrait of the world you explore.</p><p>The <em>Riven </em>remake begins with aggressive metallic sounds. After a short intro you find yourself trapped behind a set of bars that shut on you with a grating reverberation that almost hurts. That industrial hardness becomes a familiar assault on the ears as you play through <em>Riven</em>—levers being pulled, doors turning, mechanical gondolas whirring to life and zipping across metal tracks. Sometimes activation mechanisms can take a handful of seconds to reach completion, all the while the sounds clues you into some complex inner workings at play behind the scenes, giving every action more weight</p><figure id="" data-id="019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-recommend-id="image://019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cyan Worlds Inc</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-recommend-id="image://019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In contrast to the metallic whir of so many of the game’s puzzles, the islands themselves have a constant natural, soothing hum. Depending on the island, you can stop and listen to the particular chorus of life. One one, a horde of butterflies and unseen insects emit a locust-like humming. On another, the wind rushing through the trees rustles leaves while you explore. But one sound feels particularly omnipresent no matter where you are: the crashing of waves against the islands’ beaches.<br></p><p>This clashing soundscape of nature versus machine isn’t just a treat for the ears but it works as storytelling. <em>Riven </em>is very much a game concerned with the harm of forced industrialization in the context of colonizing a place. The detailed sounds that <em>Riven </em>uses help put the player in a space to recognize this conflict. Even the act of walking feels more meaningful due to how noticeable the change in footfall is between a dirt path and a metal walkway. On a mechanical level, sounds can even be necessary to pay attention to for certain puzzle solutions. </p><p>While the bulk of the game makes the islands seem almost devoid of people, certain areas tip you off that you might not be alone. A village with wooden walkways will often creak above or behind you as you walk through, as if someone is hiding just out of sight, while a sudden mechanical whirring in an area where there appears to be no machine makes you aware of the cameras placed around the map that follow your movement.</p><p><em>Riven</em>’s ambient sounds also make its measured use of an actual soundtrack more impactful. Some tracks play as you explore the island, interweaving seamlessly with the mechanical and natural sounds of the world to the point of almost forgetting that this is a soundtrack. But when the track shifts in response to a story beat or a major puzzle being solved it feels momentous and makes you sit up in attention. All of this detail is a wonderful iteration on the 1997 original. As a point-and-click adventure with less graphical fidelity as the 2024 remake’s pristine visuals, the original <em>Riven </em>leverages its world through its sounds. If you give the old game a look you’ll find that, just as in the remake, sound is ever-present. The soundscape of the remake successfully recreates the audio profile of the original and imparts on the player the importance of listening to their surroundings. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Humble Games, the publisher under the Humble Bundle umbrella that is owned by IGN, has reportedly laid off its entire team. The news of the Humble Games layoffs first came via a <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> by Senior QA Emilee Kieffer.</p>



<p>“Another year, another lay off!” she said. “Today is mine and my entire team’s last day at Humble Games.”</p>



<p>Polygon <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1815817188286009617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">senior reporter Nicole Carpenter</a> added that 36 people have been let go in what appears to be a “total closure of the company”.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to IGN Entertainment, which purchased Humble Bundle in 2017, and Ziff Davis for comment on the layoffs at Humble Games. As of publishing, no response has been received. It’s also unclear what the closure means for the future of Humble Bundle as a whole.</p>

<p>Obbe Vermeij is a legend in the Grand Theft Auto world. Last year, he kicked off a blog detailing some of his exploits from his time at Rockstar, which saw him work on the likes of GTA 3, San Andreas, and GTA IV. The relatively revealing set of posts led to Vermeij receiving an email from Rockstar warning him to stop what he was doing – causing him to give away no more secrets.</p>



<p>Now, the developer has sat down for an hour-long interview with SanInPlay, during which he spoke at length about Grand Theft Auto 6 – but his predictions aren’t what some fans are looking for.</p>

<h2 id="h-going-to-be-the-best-game-out-there">‘Going To Be The Best Game Out There’</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games revealed Grand Theft Auto 6 in December after months of the title being hyped up by millions of fans worldwide. The trailer broke viewership records and skyrocketed to the tops of newsfeeds the world over – it was a beautiful thing, and the trailer set the bar for what’s coming in 2025 (we hope).</p>



<p>Obbe Vermeij is still plugged into the world of Grand Theft Auto, and while he has stressed he knows nothing about the inner workings of GTA 6, he is an experienced voice. With 14 years of GTA-focused development under his belt, Vermeij knows more than most.</p>



<p>In the interview with SanInPlay (which was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-wont-be-wildly-different-from-gta-5-former-rockstar-dev-predicts-i-think-maybe-people-might-be-a-little-disappointed-on-the-first-day/">dug up by GamesRadar</a>), Vermeij made a bold prediction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s going to be wildly different from GTA 5, I think maybe people might be a little disappointed on the first day. But it’s still gonna be the best game out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer that we saw showcased a living, breathing world, up-to-date tech and pop culture references, and a larger map (based on estimations) than we’ve ever seen from Grand Theft Auto. It looks like we’ll get a dual-protagonist system that’s built around a story that’s as coming of age as it is romantic and potentially tragic. The trailer was also pitted with the humorous, tongue-in-cheek references and content that we’ve come to expect from the GTA series.</p>



<p>With that being said, how much can it really differ from Grand Theft Auto 5 in how it plays?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-street-the-run-got-next-unreal-engine-5-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Several former EA developers, including former Visceral Games GM Scott Probst, have formed a new studio to make a spiritual successor to NBA Street — the beloved 3v3 street basketball series released back in the early 2000s. </p><p>Titled The Run: Got Next, the new project developed by Play by Play Studios is a "character-driven, full court 3v3 hoops game that celebrates the attitude, style, and skills of streetball culture" developed in Unreal Engine 5, with players stringing together an extended winning streak against opponents either solo or with friends online (discussions are "ongoing" about whether it will include a complete offline mode). Similar to roguelites like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, players will be able to visit a shop between games to acquire "items, sponsors, abilities, kicks, and more." </p><p>The gameplay on the court will focus on unique characters with various strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. The trailer introduces some of the initial characters including Spin Cycle, High Wire, and the powerful Zamboni, each of whom can perform powerful dunks and other moves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking with IGN, co-founder and former Madden creative director Mike Young says that the team's goal is to make "defense as fun as offense" — a feat that can be difficult to achieve in sports games.</p><p>"Stars feel like stars. I think if you go back to the old school games like Nintendo Ice Hockey with small, medium, and large, you could clearly see the abilities of the characters. They had towering strengths and they had glaring weaknesses, and it made construction of a lineup for a 3v3 game very interesting," Young says.</p><p>"Do I want a fast lineup, but we're going to be weak and get checked? Or do I want a powerful lineup that's slow, but we can shoot and check?...We had a Hall of Famer like Shaquille O'Neal, who in real life had great handles. But in our game, he couldn't do say Tier 2 or Tier 3 trick moves. He would fall down and lose possession...So we want to bring that to life. The way the characters move. They're all unique. They have special moves."</p><p>Asked if The Run: Got Next will feature microtransactions, Probst told IGN that there may be cosmetics items at a later date, but The Run is not free-to-play and that there are currently no plans for microtransactions that directly impact the gameplay. As for the online play, a Play by Play Studios representative confirmed that there will be crossplay and cross-progression, but that it will not feature couch co-op at launch. </p><p>"Right now we're focusing on making sure we get the online working right for our launch," the representative told IGN. "Like everything else to do with the game, we'll listen for feedback and interest and go from there."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience — that sucks</p></div><p>The Run: Got Next will seek to fill the void left by arcade sports games like NBA Street, NFL Street, and FIFA Street, which have either been relegated to basic modes in larger licensed titles (like EA Sports FC's Volta) or eliminated entirely. Notably, The Run: Got Next has a direct connection to the original NBA Street, with Young having served as an associate texture artist on NBA Street Vol. 2.</p><p>"There was a lot of us that worked on NBA Street that always wanted to bring it back. I think it is difficult for a company that has a game like a Madden or an NBA Live that is so big. If you're putting all your resources to that, I think it was challenging to think about a secondary game," Young says. </p><p>"I was there when the Tiburon Studio brought back [NFL Blitz]. Some of the things I've seen in the past, they're just nostalgia plays and they kind of haven't evolved to a modern game. I think they don't have staying power, so they have to come out at a smaller price point. You may only attract the people who liked them, and then they play it for a weekend or a couple of weeks or bring it out every once in a while..." </p><p>"What we think the opportunity is us to bring this type of game, which doesn't necessarily exist anymore, to Gen Z, which is social. Play with friends, play against friends. We're trying to fit in with what the sim games aren't offering us. Modes like Superstar KO that were sort of one and done. We want to make the best version that would make that the game."</p><h2>A different kind of sports game</h2><p>In a letter introducing Play by Play Studios, Probst similarly took aim at the current sports gaming landscape, which is dominated by sims like NBA 2K and the recently-released College Football 25.</p><p>"As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience — that sucks," he wrote. "I've found this myself in many sports games today where I feel like I have to grind hundreds of hours to be good, I have to pay hundreds of dollars (on top of the $70 I already spent for the game itself) to have an ok time, and I have to go out on random quests to do things that don't really have anything to do with the fun of the game or the sport."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>To that end, he says, The Run will "double down on fun" while not worrying about "overly complex menus, GM modes, micromanagement of rosters, opening packs or playing a game that feels like I'm watching a broadcast."</p><p>"We look at a game like Rocket League, which is, like, you can jump in and five seconds you're into a game. They do fantastic," Probst says. "They focus on the action and the game itself. So the longer answer is that's what we want to do, is we want to get you into the game. We want you to enjoy the sport of basketball, and we absolutely want to bring tone and personality and character back and do it in a really meaningful and memorable way that feels distinct." </p><p>Ultimately, The Run's biggest challenge may be its lack of real-life players. Unlicensed sports games have had a dismal track record over the past decade. Probst acknowledges that there have definitely been "conversations" about how important licenses can be, but that ultimately they're  focused on building a "really, really fun basketball game."</p><p>"I think we want to create a fabric and a framework where we could bring in real world personalities, be it athletes, celebrities, influencers, et cetera," Probst says. "But I think first and foremost, our focus has been on the game that we're creating and bringing our characters to life."</p><p>We'll be able to see for ourselves whether The Run: Got Next is able to inaugurate a new era for arcade sports games when it launches in 2025. It's currently under development for PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-just-like-moving-little-guys-around-a-map.934908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over my years in this job, I've been forced to focus my interests and hone my critical thinking about not just individual games themselves, but the genres they exist within. If you're going to write about games for a living, you need to get better at picking them apart! A big part of that process recently has been taking my love of strategy games and trying to figure out <em>why </em>I love strategy games.</p><p>There's obvious stuff here, stuff I could have expressed years ago, stuff that any armchair fan of <em>Civilization </em>or <em>Total War</em> or Paradox could also tell you. I like playing video games set in historical time periods. I like board games, so turn-based strategy games in particular are a passion of mine. I'm a slow, considerate, solitary gamer, and few genres are as slow and considerate as strategy.</p><p>But there has to be something <em>more</em>, right? Just what is it about those games that really lights a fire under me? What's compelling me once the setting wears off and I stop seeing pikemen and just start seeing units, 1s and 0s? What's making me like one strategy game set in the 16th century and not liking another?</p><p>These are questions I've been asking myself a lot lately, through reviews and re-reviews, and while playing <em>Order of Battle</em> last week, I think I finally nailed it. Yeah, I like planning moves. But I like actually moving the guys more. </p><p>There's nothing better in <em>Civilization </em>than the early periods when I'm actively exploring and founding cities, or going to war--moving guys around--and there's nothing worse than those long periods where I just mash "end turn" because there's not much else going on (i.e., no guys to move around). <em>Crusader Kings</em> has buttons to speed up time for a reason: every second I'm not moving armies around or making decisions, I'm not living my best medieval life. Meanwhile tactics games like <em>XCOM</em>, where you're <em>always </em>moving guys around? Great!</p><figure></figure><p><em>Order of Battle</em> has slowly made this all clear to me because, as one of my guiltiest of pleasures, it's a game I've spent <em>hundreds </em>of hours with over the years. As a turn-based WW2 tactics game it's not the most realistic in the field, nor does it have the most cunning AI. What I've realised it does better than any other turn-based tactics game like this though--maybe any other strategy game, period--is let you move guys across a map.</p><p>Its campaign maps are <em>huge</em>, and you've got a lot of guys at your disposal. Sometimes you get to move them in really complex and interesting ways, like naval invasions, where you have to move ships and planes and <em>then </em>land the guys, after which you can move the ships and planes <em>and </em>the guys. Other times you're just moving <em>fast</em>, sending armoured columns deep inside enemy territory, your own front lines bulging on the map as you go. As I found myself playing one of these maps last week, clicking and clicking and clicking, I realised I had more fun moving little guys around in a failed attack than I had planning a successful one. </p><p>The act of selecting then moving units is just a blast. Pushing seven infantry units into a meatgrinder should be a tragedy, but it's not, it's great. Feigning a retreat then smashing the over-exposed pursuers? Oh buddy, you better believe that is a hoot. There is such an immense, tactile pleasure in selecting some guys, clicking on the map and watching them scoot off. Most of them have a little animation while doing so, and make a little noise as they vroom around.</p><p>It was an honest but also confronting realisation; here I was, devoting much of my professional career and personal downtime to a genre of game that I was...maybe playing wrong? Or at least not as intended? I was supposed to be here for the plans, not the guys.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Unity of Command II -- Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH38X4yro64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>With it's toy-like unit design, Unity of Command II is another excellent "Move Some Guys" game</figcaption></figure></div><p>This pleasure of picking a guy and playing with them, a digital facsimile of the joy people get painting a miniature, or having hurling an action figure around as a child, or building a model railway set, or [stop me before I say something even more tragic], is of course not unique to turn-based strategy gaming. It's common in real-time strategy too;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBqdKGiqnI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Wololo wormed its way into a generation's brains</a> not just just because it's a funny word, but because you had to click on the guys thousands of times. Which felt good, and <em>never got old</em>.</p><p>From chess to RISK, many of the most beloved and popular board games of all time involve moving guys. Tabletop wargaming has much the same appeal--pick up some guys, move them somewhere--<a href="https://kotaku.com/hg-wells-practically-invented-modern-tabletop-wargaming-5944058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it's been around for over a century</a>, itself derived from the apparent pleasure Generals of old used to get hunched over sandtables and campaign maps, drawing arrows and holding their chins in their hands while sending men to their deaths.</p><p>There's precedent, then, but it still doesn't explain <em>why</em> this is fun. Most examples I listed above are abstracting the art of generalship, ostensibly a deadly and murderous pursuit, which makes them equally unsavoury and weird. War is not fun, far from it, so why are artificial recreations of its movements such a good time? Again, I don't know, but the fact it's a pleasure to paint arrows on a map but hell to stab a man through the heart with a bayonet <em>might</em> explain why so many wars of the 17th-20th centuries were planned and executed by men (relatively) removed from the battlefield's more immediate dangers.</p><p>Whatever the underlying reasons for my joy here--whether it's tactile or just the satisfaction of seeing a plan play out--I think it's funny. Strategy games are supposed to be a brainy pursuit, a genre where thoughtfulness and meticulous planning are the entire point. The action is just the planning playing out. Yet here I am having the most fun just clicking on some guys, moving them around and sometimes, just sometimes, whispering "beep beep outta my way, tanks coming through" as they go "vroom" across the map. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204422/wooting-razer-snap-tap-socd-beta-feature<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194977/razer-snap-tap-mode-huntsman-v3-pro-wooting-rappy-snappy">beat Wooting to a speedy new keyboard feature</a> that lets players counter-strafe more quickly in a variety of competitive PC games. Now, Wooting has implemented the same feature.</p><p>Normally, to switch strafe directions in a first-person shooter, you have to fully release one key before pressing the other. If both are pressed, they cancel each other, and you stand there like a dummy for a moment until you release one of the keys.<strong> </strong>Professional players have mastered not overlapping A and D keys to get perfect counter-strafing and movement in games, but with Razer’s Tap Snap and Wooting’s new Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD) beta, you don’t need to release a key and can rapidly tap the A or D key to counter-strafe with little to no effort.</p><p>Wooting has also been working on a similar feature called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100819/wooting-80he-keyboard-rappy-snappy-feature">Rappy Snappy</a>, which works a little differently. Rappy Snappy takes advantage of Wooting’s Hall effect switches and prioritizes keys based on how far down they’re pressed, so it’s not the same as the last-pressed priority SOCD feature that Razer has branded as Snap Tap. While Wooting had <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">initially resisted SOCD</a> in favor of its own approach, it’s now offering both options for its keyboards.</p><p>Wooting’s implementation of SOCD is actually better than Razer’s, offering <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/blogs/support/what-is-socd">different resolutions</a> and the ability to have both keys active at the same time if that feels a little more natural to you. </p><p>Snap Tap, or SOCD, is already proving to be controversial among <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em> players. “Razer’s new keyboard is basically cheating,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFeny5bs2JCg">claims YouTuber optimum</a>, who does a great job of explaining how Snap Tap and Wooting’s SOCD beta work. <em>Counter-Strike</em> creator MrMaxim also <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHnjvBpPIFiw">points out</a> that Snap Tap can even help you achieve longer jumps, and it also helps you pull off “wall bugging” where you hug diagonal walls to prevent fall damage.</p><p>“Shouldn’t be allowed,” says professional <em>Counter-strike 2</em> player ropz in a <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1811135734843376086">post on X</a>. “Nice work but this is a bit too much, literally a macro / script, otherwise known as null binds.” PC players have used null binds to prevent you from pressing two opposing directions for years, in scripts that can be loaded into games or macros that can be assigned to keys. Null binding is typically banned in tournaments. Razer’s senior esports ambassador, Jimmy Malavong, was <a href="https://x.com/JimmyMalavong/status/1811138752603115807">quick to respond</a> to ropz’s concerns, noting that the company had spoken to tournament owners.</p><p>The debate around this feature looks set to continue in the weeks ahead, and it may end in games just implementing null binds to let anyone achieve this without having to buy a Razer or Wooting keyboard.</p><p>If you’re an owner of a Wooting keyboard you can grab the update that includes Rappy Snappy and this Snap Tap-like SOCD feature through the company’s <a href="https://beta.wootility.io/">beta Wootility software</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The people responsible may attempt to leverage the stolen data for fraudulent purposes.”</p>



<p>Red Art Games says that people should be “very vigilant” if they get emails or any sort of contact from someone claiming to be from the studio. </p>



<p>“We want to ensure you that the bank information are safe and hasn’t been impact by this cyberattack and we highly advise you to change the password that was used for your Red Art Games account,” they said.</p>



<p>While they recover from the attack, the studio says all shipments, order changes, and refunds will be paused for the next few days. More updates on the situation will be available “in the days to come.”</p>

It makes the boss fights significantly harder with new abilities and "legendary actions" (which D&amp;D players will know well), and it makes some of the rules a bit stricter, especially around action economy. And, of course, it restricts you to a single life and prevents you from reloading your old saves--if you die once, you have to start all the way over.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur's Gate 3 Is A Massive And Hilarious RPG</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those of you who want the extra difficulty without the brutal permadeath requirement, Patch 7 will allow you to turn on the optional Honor Mode mechanics in a Custom Mode playthrough. It's a nice addition for those of us who enjoy a challenge, but don't have the time or inclination for that full commitment. Patch 7 will also add the much-anticipated "evil endings" to the game, as well as a mod manager, revamped split-screen gameplay, and a variety of small changes. The patch doesn't have a firm release date yet, but its closed beta will launch later in July.</p>

                <p>SAG-AFTRA has authorized its chief negotiator to potentially call for an immediate strike because of a controversy surrounding the use and treatment of AI voices in video games. Union leadership has made it clear in recent statements that they regard AI as a significant issue in the voice-acting space, and that a strike is potentially in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Per a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the large union is currently in the process of renegotiating the Interactive Media Agreement, the contract that many major companies in the gaming industry abide by when making big-budget games. The hypothetical revised version of the agreement would include stronger AI protections, safety precautions for on-set performances, and higher wages.</p><p dir="ltr">The union said that some employers have pushed back on some of the AI provisions in the new draft. In response, SAG-AFTRA authorized its national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland to call an immediate strike if they don't reach an agreement soon. "If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA," the press release reads in part.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1815480189163651375" rel="nofollow ">posted a message</a> of support in response to the press release, stating that the company "supports" SAG-AFTRA's view that "game companies shouldn't receive generative AI voice-training rights on dialog recording sessions." Whether or not such training rights require an additional clause or contract is one of the key issues that the agreement will have to tackle.</p><p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA has mulled a strike for video game actors over the AI issue for the better part of a year now. Back in 2023, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actors-strike-looking-more-possible-bargaining-talks-apparently-going-nowhere/1100-6517812/">called for a vote</a> to authorize a strike if necessary, and in January of this year, several of the organization's members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">criticized</a> a newly inked deal with an AI voice studio.</p>

<li>Fixed an issues that caused the player to become invisible after jumping and shooting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the player to be positioned 50m off the ground when riding some synthetic lifeforms.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused some planets to become infested, resulting in a loss of any settlements on that world, and in minor terrain shifts. The infested status of planets has been restored to how it was pre-Worlds. Newly infested planets will become un-infested, and previously infested planets will be restored as such.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to planetary rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare rendering crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a rendering hang.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Worlds Part 1 update is a near universal refresh for No Man’s Sky. The overhaul of water and cloud rendering has been comprehensive. Water now operates on a mesh system, enabling the creation of more realistic waves and foam, while cloud coverage in the sky differs between planets and respond to weather conditions. Rain will not occur without sufficient cloud cover, and wind patterns and storm effects on flora and fauna will be more true-to-life.. The variety of skies, influenced by the colours of day and night, will reflect the unique atmosphere of each planet. The universe of No Man’s Sky is now sprinkled with new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive, and toxic worlds.</p>
<p>Hello Games will continue to update No Man’s Sky, addressing bugs and also work on the development of Worlds Part 2, as well as<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/hello-games-light-no-fire/"> the procedural adventure game Light No Fire.</a></p>
