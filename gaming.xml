			<p>Dark Souls: The Board Game – The Sunless City is a new take on the tabletop adaptation, aiming to make the rules easier to grasp, while also featuring the most iconic location from the original video game: Anor Londo. As a long-time fan of dying a lot in video games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> is an important series to me, and having also played the standard version of The Board Game, I’m happy to report that it’s definitely a little more player-friendly, while not removing any of the lethality.</p>
<p>Let’s go over what you get in the box though, because that’s pretty important for a board game. You get fifteen enemy minis with three of those being bosses. Calling the bosses “miniature” feels a little off to be honest, given that you can fight against a Titanite Demon, and then the classic duo of Ornstein and Smough, and they’re all massive. You also get three player classes – Herald, Warrior, and Pyromancer – and then a bunch of new cards covering your equipment and spells.</p>



<p>What’s really cool, is that even though the rules do take a new approach, it’s all backwards compatible. That means that you can bring in pieces from other sets you have, and that’ll unlock new classes, more boss fights, and enemies in general. We’re a big fan of this approach, because it means that the money anybody has spent on the first generation of the game isn’t wasted.</p>
<p>You can play this solo and still have a lot of fun, but can also bring up to two of your friends in to help tackle the might of Anor Londo. You’ll have to overcoming different encounters, which are decided by drawing Encounter Cards to decide on what you’ll be fighting in any given room, along with the loot that you’ll be getting as well. The Titanite Demon then stands as a mini-boss of sorts, with the big duo serving as the climactic final fight.</p>


<p>It can feel odd that, without a dedicated player for the bad guys, you have to both control them and try to overcome them, though it’s all handled by a deck of cards that serves as their attack pattern. You’ll need to learn the order of the cards, which you shuffle each time you play the game to keep it fresh, and then think ahead about what attacks are coming, and where you’ll need to be. You can also, if you want, carry your progress on into other expansions to keep games going longer, even serving as a way to allow for a month-long campaign. You don’t have to though, and that’s one of the things that makes this special.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark Souls The Board Game The Sunless City is a great new take on the already solid board game, and the classic setting, incredibly boss design, and beautiful minis only help to maintain a really high level of polish. Throw in compatibility to the original, and you've got a board game that'll keep fans incredibly happy and also serves as a good on-ramp for newer players as well. This is definitely not one you'll want to miss if you like combat-heavy board games.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, a dating sim where the studios claim you can, in fact, date everything.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the game "whisks players off into a world where everyday objects transform into romantic possibilities". If you've ever found yourself idly wishing you could romance your laundry basket, your vacuum cleaner, or even the very air you breathe, this is the game for you.</p>
<p>With the help of special "Dateviator" (surely that should be Avidater?) glasses, you'll chat up everyday objects around your home to see if any of them spark joy, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=srkdDOGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=HxGzgqXS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The possibilities for jokes here are endless.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is being made by Sassy Chap Games, a new studio formed by "a group of well-recognized voice actors" like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XV</em>'s Ray Chase and <i>Persona 5</i>'s Max Mittelman, among others.</p>
<p>As such, the game will feature 100 "fully voiced datable characters", as well as branching dialogue with multiple endings for each character.</p>
<p>Sassy Chap says that each romance path will have three potential outcomes, Love, Friend, or Hate, and each one will lead to a different resolution, which creates what the studio calls "an endless panoply of playthroughs".</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll give you a good idea of what you're in for, as well as which of your suddenly-not-inanimate waifus and husbandos you'd like to romance.</p>

<p>All of the characters mentioned above will have their own themes, and more than 11,000 hand-drawn images will bring them and their environments to life.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to fully interact with a 3D overworld that will change based on the choices you make throughout your run, so it won't just be the kind of static visual novel you might be used to from the dating sim world.</p>
<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it lands, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim"><em>Hooked on You</em></a>, then you owe it to yourself to keep an eye on this one.</p>

Combat, or specifically, engaging with enemies has been given a redesign to bring it up to the standards of, once again,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4,&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">however, this clashes with the act of survival horror and gives us the easiest distinction between action and survival horror design.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Power vs. Powerless">Power vs. Powerless</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've talked a lot about the power fantasy distinction in horror and action design in my book on the genre and previous posts. Depiction and intent are important aspects to comprehend if you're designing a horror game. Some people will say that any game that features "monsters" is supposed to be scary, but we know that's not the case.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom Eternal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;has monsters...demons actually, but the player is not supposed to be scared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, both the original and remake, brought to the table was a rethinking of what you could do in a horror setting. Leon in both versions is very capable -- he can headshot, he can perform wrestling moves, he can counter almost anything with his knife. So while the player is in a spooky area, fighting spooky people, the game is not meant to be scary. The player is in, or should be in, control of any situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">remaster, several things I noticed that gave me pause during the trailer was a greater focus on i-frame dodging, James's ability to stun an enemy before going in for a finishing blow like Leon, and in the extended trailer watching a nurse auto counter James after attacking too much.</span></p><p>Good horror has to strike balance between giving the player power and making them helpless (source IGN)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to think that improving the combat, or creating new combat mechanics, is going to make the game better, but it also clashes with one of the most essential tenets of good horror design -- you&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DON'T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;want to be fighting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Overcorrecting Horror">Overcorrecting Horror</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two over corrections happened with horror design in the 2010's. Following the success of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in the prior decade, designers started to really push the idea of combat as a focus for horror such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and the later Evils. Even&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>F.E.A.R.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;which is still highly regarded went for this idea of a military shooter meets Japanese horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other was a complete denouncement of the prior trend by smaller and indie studios. One of the most famous for that time was Frictional Games, who after the release of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penumbra</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series went on to hit it big with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amnesia-designer-removing-combat-opens-up-new-horizons/1100-6328973/">In interviews after the fact</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the co-founder often said they wanted to move away from combat/fighting in horror games as it was hurting the experience. Soon after, every single indie developer went a similar route with the likes of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;and more horror games than I can count today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some may put combat in as kind of a boss fight or end-game option, but for most of the gameplay, the player is not fighting or engaging with the enemies in any way. Looking back on both styles, the developers are wrong for different reasons. With the action side, the more the player is allowed to engage with enemies from a position of power, the less horror there is. You know a game is not meant to be scary, such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where most of the encounters are arena fights that put the combat front and center. With&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Callisto Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I said in my review that it was a good action game, but a terrible horror game for how combat devolved into a&nbsp;dodging mini-game.</span></p><p>Resident Evil 4 wants to have it both ways in terms of survival and action, but still leans more on being powerful than powerless (source author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the other side of the equation, having no combat or direct interaction with the enemies presents a different problem. It creates this black-or-white state&nbsp;that the player is either 100% safe or 100% dead. When the player knows that there is nothing else they can reasonably do, the sense of horror is replaced with a sense of frustration getting stuck at a spot repeatedly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a gameplay standpoint, it makes these horror games become exceptionally repetitive because there is only one "right way" to get through these encounters. If you watch high-level play of something like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you're not engaging with the game anymore, you are performing a fixed set of actions designed to counter the AI behavior of the enemy, not the enemy itself. In the past, I've equated horror like this to a haunted house, and in my opinion, that's not good horror design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the footage I saw from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers are obviously leaning towards the former, but this betrays several aspects of survival horror design that I don't see a lot of developers doing justice to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Scrapping By">Scrapping By</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Survival horror, as the name implies, is about "survival". This is not supposed to be about the Doom Slayer ripping and tearing through monsters, just as it isn't about someone being chased by cannibalistic monsters and deciding not to pick up any of the knives, swords, clubs, or chainsaws they find around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a very narrow place for where combat should fall in a survival horror game. It is meant to be a tool, but not "the tool" the player can use. If combat is too powerful, then it becomes the best option in any encounter if the player can just fight their way passed everything. If it's too weak or nonexistent, then the player doesn't have a way of interacting with the creatures. A good example of this philosophy would be the survival items from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 1 Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they allow the player to fight enemies a bit more safely than before, but they are still limited in their use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What you want to see in a good horror setting is that fighting is allowed, but you do not want to be doing it. There needs to be a credible risk to fighting enemies to the player's health, resources, or both. The horror in these games is a form of the same horror seen in every soulslike where the player is in uncharted territory with a ton of souls -- that risk that in any fight or situation, they could lose everything. Combat needs to be messy and chaotic, not something that you can hone your skills at like in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;where there is a legitimate challenge to get through the game, and games like it, hitless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That also means designing enemies whose only behavior isn't either "run at the player" or "run very fast at the player." Nemesis and Mr. X from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;remakes are close to what I'm looking for, but they still feel more like a phase in the level design, rather than an active enemy. Once you know their behavior, they stop being a threat. Looking at the footage from the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;trailer, the nurse was performing the same three-hit combo twice, which leads me to believe that combat is going to be mechanical in that respect.</span></p><p>The problem with Nemesis and Mr.X is that they still fall into set patterns for engagement (source Capcom)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a surprising twist, the closest a game has gotten to what I'm looking for in survival horror would be&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Bunker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The beast that stalks the player is something that can be engaged with in multiple organic ways -- you can set traps, use noise as bait, or just shoot the damn thing until it retreats. Being able to fight the creature or use the environment to your advantage gives the player a lot of options, and takes me to what I want to see as an evolution of horror.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Immsurvival">Immsurvival</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1sgpGoaOBk?si=yLegKBThoJqyauhV" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I'm looking for as an evolution of horror design is not about making the game hard to control or have janky movement, but giving the player a variety of weapons and means of survival, and making them completely terrified to use any of them against whatever "thing" is coming after them. Returning to the idea of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and push-forward combat, I had a crazy idea -- can you make a survival horror game where the player has infinite healing items and ammo by default, but still make it frightening to play?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want the enemy designs to have as much freedom to use the environment as they see fit that the player does -- the trapper becoming the trappie to then turn it around on the player. I'm tired of games that only have fixed breakable sections where an enemy can show up -- I want the player to feel like 360 degrees around them is unsafe at all times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good horror design is about making the player fight themselves as much as they are fighting enemies and making the player too powerful or too weak ends up with a horror game with either too much or too little bite to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more about horror design, you can&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.routledge.com/Game-Design-Deep-Dive-Horror/Bycer/p/book/9780367721749">check out my Deep Dive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

The changes are based on feedback from developers and players, altering how demos behave and appear on the Steam marketplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For starters, demos can now be added to Steam libraries without the need for an immediate install. A new 'add to library' button can be used to chuck demos into libraries from the mobile app or other places "where you may not be ready to install them immediately."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It will also be possible to install demos after purchasing the full game, making it easier for developers to test demos and help players manage their library.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another notable tweak will enable developers to create a separate store page for demos without impacting visibility. "By default, your free demo appears as a button on your base game's store page. But if you want to have a separate store page for your demo, you can now enable that in the 'edit store' section for your demo," reads a post from Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Enabling a separate store page for your demo will give you space to better describe the contents of the demo, add screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features. If you choose to enable a store page for your demo, you will also be enabling players of your demo to post user reviews that appear on your demo."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve says Steam will treat demos "mostly the same way" irrespective of whether they exist as a standalone page or not. That said, a standalone demo that garners negative reviews might be hamstrung in the same way as a full release. "Of course the flipside can be true too; if players are loving your demo, the positive review signal to other players may boost interest," adds Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sticking with visibility Valve says demos will now behave more like free games and can appear in all the same sections and lists. "For example, demos can now appear on the Steam homepage in charts such as the 'New &amp; Trending,' on the 'New on Steam' page, and on relevant tag and category pages,' notes Valve. "This means that launching a new free demo for your game will behave similarly as launching a free stand-alone game on Steam."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers will also be able to notify wishlisters when they launch a playable demo, potentially helping them bolster their marketing campaign.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can find out more about the latest changes on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">Steamworks blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>As reported <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Variety</a>, producer Roy Lee revealed today that Netflix lowered the budget for its BioShock movie adaptation, though it is still under way.</p>



<p>The update came up during a panel at San Diego Comic Con, which is currently running through July 28, 2024. Lee explained that “the new regime has lowered the budgets,” following the Netflix leadership shakeup.</p>



<p>They elaborated that as a result, the BioShock movie will feature “a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Lee also broke down Netflix’s general new compensation strategy, with bonuses based on viewership numbers. The producer added that “it motivates the producers to actually do a movie that gets a bigger audience.”</p>



<p>Netflix first announced the BioShock adaptation a couple of years ago, but Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence remains attached. Although Lee described the film adaptation as a “much smaller version” today, that could potentially benefit the story in some ways.</p>



<p>The original BioShock launched in 2007 to critical acclaim, and the series continues to thrive. </p>



<p>Reportedly, 2K Cloud Chamber recently ramped up development on the next BioShock video game. Just two weeks ago, the studio began <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-4-developer-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for 30 open positions</a> involving both cinematic and narrative experience.</p>



<p>At this time, the BioShock movie does not have a release window, though today’s update provides a better idea of the development timeline.</p>

    <p><span>New footage from ChinaJoy 2024.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,008 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Omega Force [1,233 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/omega-force">Omega Force</a> have released the first storyline information, as well as new screenshots and footage of <em><a title="Games > Dynasty Warriors: Origins [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a></em>. The new footage was shown during a <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> booth stage event at ChinaJoy 2024, which runs from July 26 to 29 at Shanghai New International Expo Center in Shanghai, China. <span id="more-901464"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Promising to deliver the most intense <a title="Genres > Action [2,039 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> of any <em>Warriors</em> title to date, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> introduces fans to a heroic martial artist destined to overcome the immense odds as he fights his way through waves of enemies across the battlefields of the ancient Three Kingdoms.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> introduces a new, deeper interpretation of the traditional Three Kingdoms storyline, which depicts ancient Chinese history. The story begins the year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the dawn of an era of great upheaval, when the protagonist (voiced by Jun Fukuyama)—a martial artist with amnesia—visits a village suffering from famine. Here, he meets Zhang Jiao, a long-haired man who offers a helping hand to people, and Guan Yu, a bearded warrior who denounces the injustice of government officials, and together they fight against the forces of corrupt officials.</p><p>The immersive story is experienced through the amnesiac protagonist, weaving through history as a single hero. Throughout the game, episodes of the Three Kingdoms are described in greater clarity and detail, delivering a clear and engaging experience not only for fans of the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> and <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchises, but for those who have not experienced them before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_901497"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history, intermingled and fighting with their own individual wills. Enemy soldiers attacking in cooperation are extremely formidable, and you must not only fight with your own skills, but also charge forward with your allies to clear the way. Once you push up the battleline and are prepared to fight, you and your allies can charge into the massive armies of enemies, experiencing a sense of realism of the battlefield in an unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers collide!</p><p>The protagonist of this title throws himself into the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies using swords, fists, and various other weapons. By meeting certain conditions, players can temporarily control Guan Yu and other officers marching forth by your side. Officers with strength worthy of “exhilarating one vs. 1,000 action” will become the protagonist’s most reliable allies.</p><p>Away from combat, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> displays the vast world of the Three Kingdoms on a continental map, enabling players to choose which battlefield to participate in. Also, players can interact with heroes and walk around freely on their way to the next major battlefield. </p></blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,531 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,731 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,734 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

Ahead of the game's release next month, Angry Demon Studios has unveiled a one-of-a-kind Xbox Series X that features a luxurious--and hopefully synthetic--fur wrapping. This will be given away to one lucky winner who'll have a hard time explaining what it is whenever they have company.</p><p>While the design probably isn't great for keeping the Xbox console running at an optimum temperature, it does look like the fur can come off easily. This isn't the only piece of interesting gear created by the Gori devs, as fans can also check out a unique and furry Xbox controller that has a rectal charging port. We promise that we're not making this up with our irresponsible Photoshop powers.--though the controller isn't actually going to be available.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341041" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341041"></a><figcaption>Your game developers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg"></figure><p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch on August 29, and while it looks like a cuddly early-2000s platformer in the same vein as Blinx, it's a <em>little </em>bit different from what you'd expect.</p><p>As an anthropomorphic version of nature's greatest smooth-brained killing machine--a ginger household cat--it's up to you to slay an adorably evil army of unicorns in this hack-and-slash adventure that looks kind of cute and excessively violent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coral-island-switch-port-uncertain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>developer Stairway Games has thrown doubt on the future of the game's Switch port thanks to the recent "restructuring" of publisher Humble Games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/coralislandgame/status/1816674043954925590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a letter</a> to "console players" and "Switch backers especially" released on X (formerly Twitter), Stairway says that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">recent chaos at Humble</a> leaves "consoles in a place of uncertainty", as the developer doesn't handle updates and changes to&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>on non-PC platforms.</p>
<p>The studio says it shares players' frustrations regarding the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>Switch port, and that there are a lot of things it's wanted to say "in the spirit of transparency", but that it's been unable to do so "because of the publishing agreement and NDA" it's got in place with Humble.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coral-island-switch-port-fate-yuri.jpg?itok=HJwhgZrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coral-island-switch-port-fate-yuri.jpg?itok=qUsXUmX0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I suspect you may not feel that way for long, Yuri.</figcaption></figure><p>Stairway goes on to say that the fate of&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>on consoles "remains uncertain", whether that's porting to new platforms or pushing updates and fixes, as Humble Games is responsible for these platforms.</p>
<p>According to Stairway, the studio only has access to&nbsp;<em>Coral Island</em>'s Steam backend, and so updates like the upcoming hotfix for&nbsp;<em>Coral Island</em>'s 1.1 update can't be released on other platforms because the developer has "no idea how to get this update out".</p>
<p>Conversations are currently underway between Stairway and its lawyer in order to "figure out how to navigate this new situation", but sadly, that means some bad news for Switch backers.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday's dramatic announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> may have less of an immediate impact on upcoming titles than first thought. 
</p>
<p>
While the SAG-AFTRA union has indeed voted for voice artists and performance capture personnel to strike from today, a large swathe of projects now appear unaffected. 
</p>
<p>
This includes any video game in development as of a year ago, including (for now) live service games, according to statements from both SAG-AFTRA and the companies the strike will hit, obtained by Kotaku reporter <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>.
</p>
<p>
Looking down the release schedule for the remainder of this year and into 2025, this will cover the vast majority of blockbuster titles whose development has stretched back several years. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, there had been concern among GTA fans and unclear reporting as to the impact of the strike on the game's publisher Take-Two. But it's safe to say GTA6 has been in development long enough not to be affected. 
</p>
<p>
This will also include games such as October's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and November's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, as well as the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Eurogamer has contacted EA, Activision, Ubisoft and Take-Two for comment.
</p>
<p>
"Due to certain provisions in the IMA [Interactive Media Agreement] contract, games that were in production at the time that the union provided the company its notice of termination are not currently subject to strike order. Most notices were sent in September 2022," SAG-AFTRA wrote. 
</p>
<p>
As for live-service games, while these could be impacted in future, there's also a 60-day grace period where work can continue for now. In other words, the strike would have to last more than two months before this kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"We served a separate notice relating to live service games, which we can strike in less than 60 days," SAG-AFTRA continued. "We will update the membership if we expand the strike order to include those games closer to that time."
</p>
<p>
A statement from the companies potentially impacted by the strike says similar, though notes an even more recent cut-off point for exemption from strike activity.
</p>
<p>
"The language in the IMA is clear that video games that were already in production prior to 25th August 2023, including live service games, are not subject to the strike and remain covered by the ongoing terms of the 2020-2022 IMA. Performers would not be in violation of the strike order if they continue working on these games."
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity said it stood "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA</a>, but wouldn't authorise its own strike.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
CEO of Paradox Fredrik Wester has admitted the publisher "made the wrong calls in several projects", following the cancellation of its The Sims competitor Life By You.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">game was cancelled back in June</a>, and the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic, was closed.

</p>
<p>
Wester commented on Life By You as part of Paradox's <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024-correction">latest financial earnings report</a>, stating the cancellation was a "difficult decision... as the game would not be able to meet our expectations."

</figure>

<p>
He continued: "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change.
</p>
<p>
"We have areas here where we need to improve, for example in production, quality and risk assessment. In 2021, we made major changes to how we invest in riskier projects, which means that we have not started new projects with the same combination of high risk and high costs as Life by You."
</p>
<p>
Along with the cancellation of Life by You, Paradox previously received criticism for the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">Cities: Skylines 2 due to its poor performance</a>. A disappointing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">DLC was rushed out and subsequently refunded</a>.


</p>
<p>
That followed the troubled development of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of 2023's The Lamplighters' League</a>, and repeated delays of Prison Architect 2 that led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parting ways with developer Double Eleven</a>.


</p>
<p>
"Despite great annoyance at our own mistakes, we have faith. Paradox's future is bright, but we need to roll up our sleeves and work hard to fully realise the potential," concluded Wester.
</p>
<p>
The cancellation of Life by You has resulted in a 90 percent decrease in operating profit for its latest quarter, while revenue decreased by 22 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Still, Wester believes Paradox's "core business has performed very well" due to ongoing efforts to update Cities: Skylines 2 and the release of Victoria 3's Sphere of Influence expansion among others.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-reveals-new-plans-for-mobile-gaming/</link>

<p>Epic Games has announced its updated strategy for mobile gaming. Fortnite will return to the iOS store in the European Union, while the Epic Games Store will be available again on Android worldwide and on iOS in the European Union. The new terms involve a 12% store fee for transactions made through Epic Games and a 0% fee for third-party payments.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we announced our new strategy for bringing our games to mobile stores. We're not only approaching the launch of Epic Games Store for mobile, we are also working to put our games on other independent stores that strive to bring fair terms to all developers, including…</p>— Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1816553539524575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, Epic Games stated that they will be “ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our games.” This&nbsp;decision, which is a response to the situation with&nbsp;Apple and Google,&nbsp;paves&nbsp;the&nbsp;way for&nbsp;Fortnite and more of their mobile&nbsp;games&nbsp;to&nbsp;be available in&nbsp;new mobile stores.</p>



<p>Epic Games expanded, stating they have “long been advocating for the rights of stores to exist and compete fairly on iOS and Android, and progress is spreading across the globe, in the form of Europe’s DMA, similar laws in the UK and Japan, regulatory investigations around the world, and victory in the Epic v Google litigation in the US”. Epic wants to take advantage of this opportunity to bring “developers a great deal” through their store and also support other stores.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-arrives-on-altstore">Epic Games Arrives on AltStore</h2>



<p>Epic Games is bringing its mobile games to AltStore on iOS in the EU as part of its strategic expansion. This is just the beginning, with support for at least two other third-party stores to arrive soon. AltStore is a trusted app store designed to side-load mobile apps on iOS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Epic Games announced that Fortnite and its other mobile titles will no longer be available on the Samsung Galaxy Store. This decision is in response to “Samsung’s anticompetitive move to block side-loading by default on Samsung Android devices.”</p>



<p>In other news, Epic Games recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-claims-apple-is-stalling-store-launch-over-button-similarities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple was stalling the store launch over button similarities</a>. They also recently acknowledged the presence of ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-epic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay-to-win’ car skins</a> in Fortnite. What are your views on Epic Games’ new strategy for mobile gaming? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has started to openly discuss switching <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> away from 5v5 team matches and back to the 6v6 team sizes that defined the original game.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/">Director’s Take blog post</a>, Game Director Aaron Keller digs into the broad debate between 6v6 and 5v5, the advantages that the current form has, its difficulties, and announcing that Blizzard will be holding some gameplay tests to look at how it holds up.</p>


<p>The key reason to switch to 5v5 was to break up a tank-heavy meta. Now, with just one tank per side, there’s just one defensive barrier for a team to break through (double shield was a big issue), making damage character feel more effective, allowing healers to do more than just buff the front line, and making ultimates and ultimate combos less of an integral play.</p>
<p>The other positive side effects were a reduction in matchmaking times as the 1-2-2 format better matches up to what people actually want to play as, easier to read matches as you’re tracking nine other players instead of eleven, and even marginally improved performance.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, players of the game have consistently banged the drum for a return to 6v6. Two tanks both allowed for stronger team compositions that could make up for a weak link, and for heightened moments of chaos when a defensive line does fold. It’s a fun factor that the vocal parts of the community want to have back.</p>

<p>However, Keller notes that, “At the end of the day, we want to make the game that players want to play.” So, if people want 6v6 again, Blizzard needs to look at that.</p>
<p>He continues, “because we operate as a service to our players, we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. &nbsp;Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we’d prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration.</p>
<p><strong>“With that said, we’re looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2</strong>. The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results. This is taking some time, however, for reasons that may not be readily apparent.”</p>
<p>At this point, Blizzard is still just investigating how these tests will look – there’s UI factors like healer vision that need to be looked at, and as mentioned, they may have to find new optimisations to keep performance as it should be.</p>
<p>If the community still wants 6v6 after these tests, and they match up to all of Blizzard’s metrics and analytics, then it could become a permanent switch or a new option.</p>
<p>Keller wraps up:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going to jump on a soap box for a moment. When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it’s clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match. We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel “the same” from game to game. While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we’d like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it. For instance, we think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue. We’ll be running at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea in Season 13. There are some gotchas to this direction, but after reading 400 pages of this blog, I hope you’re all able to see that there are trade-offs to many of the decisions that go into this game (and into any game, really).</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement comes just as Overwatch 2 is about to face fresh competition for its hero shooter crown, with Sony about to launch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> as a premium title, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> free-to-play alternative. Now, more than ever, Blizzard needs to try and keep their community on board.</p>

            <p>No Rest for the Wicked developer Moon Studios has released its first new content update for the early access release.</p>
<p>Known as The Crucible update, it brings a "whole new Crucible" (seems fitting), as well as a new fungal enemy faction known as the Gloam, a new Exalted item status, the promise of "more visceral" combat and more.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser for the update in the video below.</p>

<p>The Crucible is an endgame roguelike dungeon in No Rest for the Wicked, which thanks to this update has been revamped in a bid to improve players' experience.</p>
<p>"With this update, we've more than tripled the number of randomised chambers within the Crucible, introduced a whole new art theme, added a brand new vendor, and introduced an entirely new gameplay system called Echoes," the developer said. </p>
<p>These Echoes will allow players to "customise every run with a huge variety of buffs and effects". In turn, this means players will be able to create a "build on top of your build", leading to more in-game possibilities. </p>
<p>
"Thanks to Echoes and the randomisation of them, no two runs in the Crucible will ever be alike," the No Rest for the Wicked team said.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, players can now "rip, tear, shatter and shred opponents", which certainly sounds more visceral! These effects are more than just for visuals, as players can utilise them to overcome the "treacherous difficulty found in the depths of the Crucible".</p>
<p>If you need a slightly more serene moment after all that ripping and shredding, the No Rest for the Wicked team has also added in some new stray animals to pet.</p>
<p>Full details on No Rest for the Wicked's most recent update - including news it's Steam Deck Verified along with other Quality of Life improvements - can be found on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4338739067969013801">game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"As always, our team is hard at work on awesome new content and features. We're eager to share more details on our Early Access Road Map soon so stay tuned for that," Moon Studios closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to hear back from you. We are always listening and working meticulously on shaping Wicked to be the best it can be."</p>

<p>Back in April, Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler compared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-moon-studios-lord-of-the-rings-says-ceo">No Rest for the Wicked to Lord of the Rings</a>, stating there's plenty to come after the game's 1.0 release. However, despite what many of us want (raises hand), this does mean we shouldn't expect a third Ori game "any time soon". Sigh.</p>

The 10-year-old Dragon Age Inquisition not only requires an EA account to play on Steam, but EA online activation and Origin (now outdated) client software installation and background use as well.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>But EA and developer BioWare have decided to make the upcoming action fantasy role-playing sequel go “all-in” on Steam in news that’s already been welcomed by PC gamers. The decision comes following a backlash to Sony’s decision to force Steam users to create a PlayStation Network account in order to play games published to Valve’s platform — including single-player games.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is verified on Steam Deck, BioWare tweeted.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're making great progress towards our fall launch date, and can confirm early that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard is going all-in on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Steam</a> features!<br>⚔️We're verified on Steam Deck.<br>⚔️We'll be Steam native - meaning the EA App will not be required to play the game.</p><p>Details on…</p></div>— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1816511768044163410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is still without a release date, although BioWare has said it’s out fall 2024. The studio said it’s making “great progress” towards the fall launch date, but there’s no announcement just yet. Details on launch are coming later this summer, the developer added.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more">BioWare revealed who voices the companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, in addition to some returning actors from past games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy"><u>As previously confirmed</u></a>, all the companions are romance options for the player.</p><p>Much of BioWare’s creative and voice talent are set to appear on a panel today, July 26, at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/san-diego-comic-con-2024-everything-announced">San Diego Comic-Con</a>.

The video introduces new tactical system FC IQ, as well as player roles, new play styles for goalkeepers, and more.</p><p>The new FC IQ system, which EA describes as "a complete overhaul of the game's tactical system," will allow for more in-depth tactical play, with players having more fine control over the team's tactics. "FC IQ can be used to easily emulate a favorite manager's tactics," says gameplay producer Paul Parsons, running through an example inspired by Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti.</p>

<p>As part of this system, EA has also added Player Roles for FC 25, allowing you to set a player's role to deploy them in different ways depending on the situation and your personal strategy. "We built an out-of-game AI model in order to help identify which Player Roles fit players in FC," Parsons explains, adding that some players will have a plus, or a plus-plus indicating that the player is either accomplished or world-class in that role.</p><p>EA is also adding Smart Tactics, a system that will automatically provide tactical suggestions to the player as the game progresses. You can also share useful tactics with friends or followers using a code system.</p><p>FC IQ will be in use across all modes, including Clubs and Career Mode, which EA adds will be getting its own deep dive further down the track. "FC IQ will also influence the core systems in Career relating to Transfers, Scouting, and the Youth Academy," says producer Thomas Caleffi. "Meaning squad building and development goes way beyond just OVRs."</p><p>EA Sports FC 25 will release on September 27, 2024. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-preorder-guide-bonuses-release-date-editions/1100-6525124/" data-ref-id="1100-6525124">Preorders are open now</a>, with early unlocks and additional bonuses for players who preorder the game.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s BioShock adaptation has been "reconfigured" to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget.</p>
<p>That's according to producer Roy Lee, who told fans at a panel at San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined.</p>

<p>"The new regime has lowered the budgets," Lee added, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/">Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"So we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project."</p>
<p>Lee also told the audience that Netflix had also changed its "compensation strategy" so that, like more traditional film production studios, bonuses are attached to viewership, "motivat[ing] the producers to actually do a move that gets a bigger audience".</p>
<p>Last week, a screenshot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-screenshot-leaks-online-heres-what-it-tells-us">purportedly taken from Cloud Chamber's upcoming BioShock game</a> - codenamed "Parkside" - popped up online.</p>
<p>Whilst the image itself isn't particularly exciting - we can see a weapon, called the "ricochet shotgun" and some kind of weird glowing sphere, er, thing - we do get to see how the UI looked at the time the demo was created (thought to be around 2021), and get our first peek at some of the powers available to players.</p>

		<p>It’s time once again to round out the week with a look back at what’s been keeping our controllers, mice and keyboards busy. For me, it’s been a week of Overwatch 2, and balancing where the best place to play it on the go is, whether that’s on Steam Deck where it looks great but chews through the battery, or Switch where it looks a bit rough and ready, but gets through more than six or so rounds. I’ve had a torrid week of it though, and played resolutely rubbish, sliding down the rankings. I’m blaming being ill.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ve reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> which I really enjoyed, checked out No Man’s Sky and the new update which makes it feel like a new game, and played more Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part I Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 and more RoboCop. But he’s also been to see Deadpool vs Wolverine, which is apparently very good! <strong>Nick P</strong> has been playing a lot of the Marvel Rivals Beta telling us that it’s “REALLY solid. I’m going to put a lot of time into the full game upon release”. He’s also made a good choice and played a lot of Kunitsu-Gami, saying, “I’m in love!”. So, I think he likes it.</p>
<p>Having wrapped up his playthrough of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Aran said it’s a “Decent game overall.” He’s also been playing FM2024 and got Nottingham Forest promoted back to the Premier League after a play-off final against Bristol City that went to penalties. And finally, he’s also started Deadlink for review.</p>

<p><strong>Jim </strong>is continuing with ‘Operation Clearing My Backlog of Open World Games’. He says, “After beating Skyrim, I’ve put my Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough on pause – while I’m really enjoying my time in Night City, I’ve barely had time to touch my PS5. Or, maybe I’ve just got the Bethesda bug? Fallout: New Vegas has shot to the top of my playlist and while it’s definitely showing its age (I’m playing on Steam Deck with no mods) I’m totally absorbed in its world, weighing up which of the warring factions to side with.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> played Elden Ring this week, and he says, “It is clearly great but I don’t think I have the patience to finish it.” He’s also played Mount and Blade Bannerlord, which is, seemingly, “great.” It’s one that I’ve got sat in my ‘to-play’ pile so I need to get into it too!</p>
<p><strong>Steve </strong>has played through the “decent” Flintlock, put some time into Tchia for Microsoft Rewards and started the beautiful Kena on PS5. That’s not all though, telling us, “Alongside these I’ve continued to work through the original Breath of Fire which is great but, my god, games were obscure about progression back then.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been continuing on with his journey through SteamWorld Heist 2, and slowly but surely wrapping his head around how best to fit some nice new ethernet cables under the stairs.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played this week?</p>

            <p>I don't know what the longest-running early access game in history has been (perhaps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-zomboid">Project Zomboid</a>?) but I know that zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/7-days-to-die">7 Days To Die</a> is definitely up there. We first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/7-days-to-die-looks-virally-impressive">reported its appearance</a> back in the dark ages of 2013. For context, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> came out. Whoa! Okay, calm down, sorry, I didn't mean to panic you. Yes, the arrow of time is inviolable. We are all marching steadily towards our graves, I know. But at least now 7 Days To Die has finally released its fully baked version 1.0.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The 1.0 release comes out today and brings "more optimizations, polish, quality-of-life improvements, new content, new features, and new gameplay systems than ever before," say developers The Fun Pimps, who must surely be tired. </p>

<p>Their summary is also putting it somewhat mildly. The <a href="https://7daystodie.com/v1-0-official-release-notes/">full patch notes</a> are enormous. The world generation has been beefed up, making it faster and, theoretically, resulting in more interesting worlds. A bunch of new "points of interest" will now appear, including new theatres, high schools and hotels. There are new zombie variants (though I think this is mostly a cosmetic thing, for example, a new type of nurse zombie and a "bowling alley" zombie). There are new animal and vehicle models, lighting has been overhauled, a "new and improved Dismemberment Gore System" will make things bloody in some fresh ways, and there are now various "challenges" to act as tutorials for new players (replacing an old system of quests). There's a bunch more stuff besides this that I cannot face communicating to you, lest it add another decade to the clock.  </p>
<p>Even after all that, the developers say they're not done working on the game. A roadmap for future updates includes hints of a weather system, an overhaul of traders, new bandits, and a story mode. All that is set to take them up to the end of 2025, they say. </p>
<p>I last played the horde-blasting starvation sim ten years ago, following its first shambling onto the scene. I liked it back then, enjoying the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/7-days-to-die-diary">lonely log cabin defending</a> and simple nightly defenses of my new home (then getting absolutely destroyed by a much bigger swarm). I'll be diving back in to let you know how it holds up after all this time. It's possible a decade of half-hearted survival games has blunted the edge of my enjoyment of the genre. But I do like digging pits for zombies to fall into. Check back for fuller thoughts sometime next week.</p>

            <p>
UK actors' union Equity stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA following news of a strike, though won't be authorising a strike itself.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union announced a strike after failing to reach a deal with major video game companies over the use of AI</a> following "more than a year and a half of negotiations".

</p>
<p>
"Equity stands in total solidarity with SAG-AFTRA who have taken the brave decision to authorise a strike against US video games companies," reads a <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/campaigns-policy/international-work/solidarity-statement-advice-regarding-sag-aftra-interactive-media-industrial-action-2024">statement from Equity</a> assistant general secretary John Barclay.

<p>
"Voice and performance capture artists are a vital part of this multibillion-dollar industry, bringing to life characters that make games successful. We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members' rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation.
</p>
<p>
"In light of the strike authorisation, it is incumbent on the studios, producers and game developers that are operating in the UK to be transparent with performers and inform our members if they are commissioning work for a struck company. Excessive non-disclosure agreements should not be used to undermine the bargaining position of the creative workforce."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Equity is "very concerned about the lack of safeguards to protect performers in the unregulated world of AI alongside our members' health and safety, which is not always being taken seriously".
</p>
<p>
Barclay then states the games industry benefits "hugely" from tax relief in the UK. "In 2022, nearly £200m was paid to games companies in tax relief, and a total of £830m has been paid out since 2014," he says. "Despite this huge financial gain to games companies, pay has stagnated and does not reflect our members' valuable contribution. 
</p>
<p>
"Equity remains committed to constructive dialogue with voice studios, performance capture studios, publishers, developers and trade bodies and we urge the industry to work with the union so that we can resolve these ongoing issues."
</p>
<p>
So why isn't Equity also striking? In an FAQ following the statement, Equity explains that "industrial relations legislation in the United Kingdom is very restrictive" and the "employment status of Equity members makes it even more difficult to overcome those hurdles in this context".
</p>
<p>
It continues: "Crucially, Equity does not have a collectively bargained agreement with the major UK video games vendors, which means we are not able to enter into a formal dispute like our sister union. The union has worked hard to try and establish collective agreements in the video games industry for many years, but we have faced ongoing resistance from the industry. The lack of collective agreements for video games stands in stark contrast to the UK film and TV industry, where collective bargaining is the norm."
</p>
<p>
Instead, Equity is working on its own programme to protect the rights of performers.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-and-equity-are-battling-the-rise-of-ai-driven-deepfake-mods">Equity released its "ground-breaking AI toolkit"</a> and called for urgent government action against what it calls "performance cloning".

</p>
<p>
Another wrinkle detailed in the FAQ is that SAG-AFTRA members contracted to work in the UK for a struck company are unable to go on strike due to UK law. "As the strike has been authorised under legislation in the United States but is not lawful under United Kingdom legislation, you have no protection against being dismissed or sued for breach of contract by the producer or your engager if you take strike action or refuse to cross a picket," it reads.
</p>
<p>"SAG-AFTRA's dispute is not lawful under United Kingdom law. Whilst we stand in solidary, this is not an Equity dispute, and you are free to accept work."</p>
<p>Actors have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-remain-sceptical-about-the-use-of-ai-in-gaming">voiced their concerns about AI</a> over the last couple of years. I spoke with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> actors at the BAFTA Gaming Awards who revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">the darker side of the game's success fuelled by AI voice cloning</a>.</p>

            <p>Chaotic poker-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> quickly captured hearts and frazzled minds when it released earlier this year. However, nowhere in Katharine’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">review</a> does it address the one eternal issue: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/can-it-run-doom">can it run Doom</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, according to reddit user UwUDev, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1eby5y7/literally_nobody_asked_for_it_but_here_it_is_doom/">shared their prototype</a> for how the seminal FPS could be played within the confines of a comedy poker game. The answer, apparently, is to just turn a big pile of Joker cards into portions of a video screen. A simple solution, though one that quickly caught the <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1816567788078870924">approving attention</a> of Balatro dev LocalThunk.</p>
<p>Thus spake UwUDev: "It's super laggy and I often have big lag spikes but it works. I'll see later if I can optimize it because it's really unplayable x)". Wait, if the creator says it’s unplayable then can we truly say Doom is running? Is this a 'minimum 30fps or jog on' situation or do we lower our standards considering someone got it working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">jailbroken tractor</a>?</p>
<p>After some initial umming, I think I’d fall into the "lower our standards" camp – surely Doom does not need to actually be <em>comfortable</em> to play for official Can It Run Doom certification, as long as it merely runs. But then this Balatro mod stretches the definition of "runs" as it so heavily manipulates and reshapes the game’s systems that it arguably no longer even resembles the original; at least the tractor screen was intended as a screen. I don’t think Balatro cards were ever meant to be vessels of video output, even if it is fun how shuffling them around also moves the corresponding window of Doom footage.</p>
<p>Then, of course, you get into arguments over whether the wacky device needs to simply <em>display</em> Doom, or to handle the actual processing for it, and honestly at this point I think the fun just stops. Maybe this post should as well, so just go look at the <a href="https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/">It Runs Doom! Tumblr</a>.</p>

Anyway, yeah, they don't appeal to me at all. Not as much as "Dateviator" glasses, which come courtesy of Sassy Chap Games and their upcoming dating sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/date-everything!">Date Everything!</a> As the title suggests: you date everything, from kitchen sponges to lampshades, as they morph into absolute fitties once you've donned the special specs. It looks incredibly dumb but in the best possible way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what's been coined as a "sandbox" dating simulator, the game sees you explore a home from a first-person perspective and don the Dateviator glasses to chat up everyday objects. We're talking hoovers, cabinets, toasters, fridges - pop those glasses on and anything becomes 10/10 shaggable. While there's not much info on exactly why or how or who or what is going on, the devs do say there's a "critical path tying it all together", with all dateable objects having three "relationship resolutions": Love, Friend, or Hate. Imagine leaning in for a kiss with a nail clipper and getting pied. Unthinkable.</p>

<p>There are other tidbits of info, like there being 100 fully voiced dateable characters (things?) all voiced by strong voice actors from all sorts of games like Final Fantasy XV, Persona 5, HiFi Rush and more. Not to mention that the game will cater for a "wide array of player preferences and tastes", so everyone can get involved in… whatever this game is.</p>
<p>It has got me thinking, though. What household object in my home would I date? My coaster? My laptop sleeve? Truthfully, I think it would be my Sonic The Hedgehog lamp that isn't actually of the character Sonic, but just the words "Sonic The Hedgehog". Dear reader, what household object would you date? I am sure I won't regret asking you such a thing.</p>
<p>There isn't a release date yet, but you can follow the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Steam</a> if you're curious.</p>

Coral Island developer Stairway Games has responded to the lack of Switch port, blaming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">recent layoffs at Humble Games</a> for leaving console versions "in a place of uncertainty".

</p>
<p>
The cosy life-sim game received over $1.6m in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/faqs">Kickstarter funding</a>. However, some backers who specifically backed the game for a Switch version are angry at the lack of news for a port. Other backers have claimed requests for PS4 keys have been automatically upgraded to PS5 without consent.
</p>
<p>
At present, the game is available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (plus Game Pass), but not Switch.
</p>

<p>
Comments from backers have been shared on social media, describing the situation as "super gross". "At this point, I just want my money back," wrote one backer. "I can't get what I paid for, so I'd like to be refunded."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coral Island made $1M from kickstarter campaign which included Switch players. There is still no Switch version of the game and these backers are not being offered alternative keys. Essentially being ghosted after they helped fund the game. Why is no one talking about this? <a href="https://t.co/mmeCih248z">https://t.co/mmeCih248z</a></p>— Jupie ✨ (@jupieverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/jupieverse/status/1816135472323641831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>
Now, Stairway Games has released a statement addressing the situation, claiming "the impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles... as they are responsible for these platforms".
</p>
<p>
"To start, we share in your frustrations regarding the lack of a Nintendo Switch port of Coral Island," the statement reads. "Over the years, there's a lot we've wanted to say in the spirit of transparency, about many different things, but continue to be unable to do so because of the publishing agreement and NDA we have in place.
</p>
<p>
"The impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles, whether porting or pushing hotfixes, as they are responsible for these platforms. We've been in communication with our lawyer since we found out about the restructuring on social media to figure out how to navigate this new situation.
</p>
<p>
"For example, we have an upcoming hotfix for the 1.1 update nearing release for Steam. We have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don't have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out. We only have access to the Steam backend."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
As a result, Switch backers are now being offered a key change to Steam, effective immediately, by emailing the developer: contact@stairwaygames.com. However, this doesn't account for the fact some backers may not have a suitable PC to play the game.
</p>
<p>
"We'll keep you posted on developments once we have more information," the statement concludes. "We know it fucking sucks but we hope you understand."
</p>
<p>
It should be noted, though, the Humble Games layoffs occurred just earlier this week. The Coral Island Kickstarter was launched in 2021 and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-island-farming-sim-coral-island-leaves-pc-early-access-in-november">game released out of early access in November 2023</a>.

</p>
<p>
Until now, the only comment for Switch backers on Kickstarter was: "We're still in the game development process and going strong. We don't have any updates to share yet, but we'll keep you informed as soon as we have more to share."
</p>
<p>
The tropical island farming sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-farming-kickstarter-success-coral-island-now-in-early-access">launched into early access in October 2022</a> after its successful Kickstarter campaign. Since then, it's received plenty of updates adding new content, including its 1.1 "Story Finale: Land &amp; Sea" update this week.

</p>
<p>
It's considered a major competitor to Stardew Valley, whose solo developer earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">stated he would "never" charge money for a DLC or update</a> "for as long as I live".

Sony had said it would mainly affect the suspension physics model and tire physical calculation model, “resulting in much more natural weight shifting during cornering.” Tire response was also said to have been improved, along with more realistic tire heating and wear. “Look forward to more dynamic car movement and a further polished driving feel,” Ken Chan, senior product manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-49-brings-six-new-cars-updated-physics-simulation-model-and-more-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p><p>But following the update's release, player discovered that cars had a tendency to bounce their way down the track, or even fly off as Gran Turismo 7's new physics model broke down.

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>March 2020 seems a very long time ago, but it was start of probably the biggest world event any of us will live through. Billions of people were effectively forced to stay home for months at a time through the pandemic, and the impact of that event continues to this day as working from home is for many, normal. We have reconfigured our homes to have multiple functions, so as I type this, I’m at my desk which has three monitors, my work laptop, and my music studio PC, and my PS5 just off to the right. So, it would be damn handy if there was a sturdy chair that I could use both for work and gaming, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451520">To give you an idea of the size, here’s the C7 box next to another office chair purchased from Amazon.</p>
<p>The Flexispot C7 Air is an all-in-one solution to this problem, a premium office chair that also works if you want so slouch back and play some video games. Since the chair is packed full of features and very sturdy it comes in a rather large box and weighs 25kg, You do need to assemble it yourself, but it’s rally just a case of slotting a few things together and using the supplied tool to tighten a few bolts, it’s really quite simple. Even so, the weight and shape mean it’s best if you have a friend to give you a hand.</p>


<p>Once assembled there are plenty of features to adjust including the height, arm rests, and head support, but it’s the lumbar support that is star of the show. Flexispot have done some nifty engineering and the arc-shaped mesh support hinges from the bottom to always find the right place no matter what position you are in. This means you are always sitting in the correct position and fully supported and frankly it’s been a game changer for me and my back.</p>
<p>As soon as you sit down you can feel the gentle pressure of the cushion which pushes your back into the correct place no matter how you sit. Even if you slouch back or lean forward it adapts and Flexispot have taken all sorts of positions in to account – you can even sit cross-legged in the chair. That does seem like a bold claim but I can report that a 6ft5″ 120kg man (i.e. me) can do that, although I did have to use the attached foot rest to support my (humble brag) massive legs.<br>
</p>

<p>While you’ll likely be sitting up while working, the C7 can recline to what almost feels a dangerous angle – it’s not, I’ve tried to make the chair tip over without success. The lumbar support is still in full effect here, so even if you are technically slouching you are fully supported. It’s in this relaxed mode the chair is best for gaming, especially if you add the optional foot rest. I have played many a Destiny 2 marathon without a single ache or pain, but I think the best compliment I can give is that I fell asleep not once, but twice whilst in this position.</p>
<p>The chair is extremely well made and solid and while I can’t comment on the long term durability given the time I have been using the chair, I can tell you that back in 2021 I reviewed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/23/flexispot-e7-electric-standing-desk-review/">Flexispot E7 desk</a> and it’s still the desk I use today. I have not had a single issue with it and the C7 Air seems just as sturdy and durable. It’s also worth mentioning that the chair comes with a&nbsp; five year warranty just in case something does go wrong.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451526">The C7 and proof that even giant, grumpy looking oafs can sit cross legged in it.</p>
<p>To use an old but accurate phrase, “You get what you pay for”. I have worn out countless £100-200 gaming chairs, with their foam padding and fake leather eventual degrading through basic use and, speaking from experience, leaving lots of bits of fabric across the carpet. The Flexispot C7 Air Chair is more expensive and usually retails for £399 but the company has regular sales – in fact there is one on now and you can grab it for <a href="https://flexispot.co.uk/premium-ergonomic-office-chair-c7-air.html">£299. </a> I know that’s still a lot of money, but it’s by no means the most <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/sihoo-doro-s300-chair-review/">expensive premium chair around</a>, and a good chair is an investment now that your back will thank you for a decade from now.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A good chair is like finding the love of your life, you didn't know you needed it until it arrives. The Flexispot C7 supports you without you even noticing and is quite happy for you to fall asleep in it's arms, if it could cook me dinner then I'd ditch the boyfriend.  	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206720/steam-game-demos-update-library-store-pages<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has introduced some changes to Steam that should make it easier to find and install playable game demos. In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">new events blog post</a>, Steam said the “Great Steam Demo Update” was based on developer and player feedback, with new functionality that makes demos behave more like standalone games hosted on the platform.</p><p>For one, demos can now have a store page that’s completely separate from the main game, allowing developers to display demo-specific content like trailers, screenshots, and supported features. These pages will also display buttons to both install the demo and visit the main game’s store page, and allow players to leave demo-specific reviews.</p><p>And if a demo becomes available for a game that users have on their wishlists, or from a developer that they follow, those users can now be notified via email or mobile alerts. Demo listings can also now appear on the same lists and category pages as free games, such as the “New &amp; Trending” section of Steam’s homepage charts. Alongside free games, users may see demos appearing more frequently as Steam says it’s made “some changes to the thresholds” in order to “better balance them with paid products.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Free games and the newly supported gaming demo listings will appear more frequently in Steam’s charts.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Steam</cite></p></div><p>Other new features in this update include the ability to add demos to Steam libraries without immediately installing them, allowing demos to be installed even if the user already owns the full game, and making it easier to remove demos by right-clicking on them. When the demos are uninstalled they’ll also be removed from the user’s library.</p><p>The visibility changes introduced in this update may resurface older demos on user accounts, with Steam saying “We’ve tried our best to clean up the demos that we expect you don’t care about anymore, but we may have missed some.”</p><p>Amusingly, Steam added a note in the “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563#:~:text=Q.%20What%20is%20the%20deal%20with%20the%20Demo%20icon%3F%20Is%20that%20a%20plate%3F%20A%20vinyl%20record%3F">infrequently asked questions</a>” section of the blog for users who don’t know that Steam’s demo icon is based upon the Compact Disc, not a dinner plate. Am I so old that we’re really at the point of modernizing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16505912/floppy-disk-3d-print-save-joke-meme">save icon / floppy disk</a> gag?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
