			<p>If you're getting started with <a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/">League of Legends</a>, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the number of choices you have and how many champions there are to choose from, especially if you begin to consider the meta and off-meta builds, where some champions are played in a role that they were not originally designed for. If you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and aren't sure <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what champion</a> to pick if you want to play ADC (Attack Damage Carry), this guide will tell you some of the best ones to start with.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner-Friendly League of Legends ADCs</h2>
<p>There are a wide variety of ADCs available in League of Legends, with the roster continuously expanding. However, some of them are designated to be beginner-friendly and have significantly fewer mechanics to worry about compared to others. Here are some of the easiest ADCs you can start within League of Legends.</p>
<p><strong>Ashe&nbsp;</strong>is one of the easiest ADCs you can start within League of Legends. Compared to some of the others available, her abilities are relatively straightforward and don't require a tremendous amount of finesse. It's very easy to harass your opponent due to her range and frost capabilities, making it relatively easy to get the kill if you have a communicative support backing you up. When it gets to the late game, Ashe's Ult can be beneficial if you use it correctly, as it can fly the entire length of the map and freeze the person it hits. This can make for some very successful ganks and picks, especially if they are out of position and away from their teammates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Tristana</strong> is a lot of fun and has some excellent mobility, which can keep her safe and get her out of sticky situations should you find yourself in them. Compared to other ADCs, her mobility is better than that of a fair amount of them, especially for those who are new to the game and don't want to try and figure out how to play characters like Akshan. Leveling up Tristana's explosives is vital, as it can help her get a kill from a distance if she manages to stack damage on the bomb. It's also great at chipping away at Turrets, and she can quickly clear the lane with her damage as her basic attacks damage nearby enemies when a minion is killed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sivir</strong> is another ADC who is great at zipping down the lane, dealing a fair amount of damage, and chipping away at her opponent or the tower. Compared to other champions, Sivir has a great way of restoring lost mana, a resource that she relies on quite heavily to be able to use her other abilities. Using her Spell Shield, she has the capability to block the attack or crowd control from her opponent and gain mana back from using it successfully. It takes time to get to grips with her Spell Shield, especially if you're new to the game. Her ultimate is one of the most useful ults an ADC can have, as it speeds up both her and her allies and allows her to sprint down the lane to get into (or out of) the thick of it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Miss Fortune&nbsp;</strong>can be a real powerhouse once you get used to her abilities. It can be a little bit tricky getting used to her Double Tap ability, as you have to make sure you fire it on the right target to be able to get the crit on the other target. This can take some getting used to and doesn't always work out how you want it to. However, she has great wave clear pokes against her opponents and isn't too hungry compared to some other ADCs. Her ultimate can easily wipe out an entire team if you manage to aim it correctly, but this is another ability that may take a little bit of getting used to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the most beginner-friendly ADCs in League of Legends that you can play right now and can often purchase using Blue Essence for a decent price. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>

The Game Boy Color RPGs brought fans to the Johto region, introduced 100 new monsters, and are widely considered some of the best games in the franchise’s long history. To commemorate the anniversary, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-winter-holiday-merch-christmas-nintendo-1851675507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-winter-holiday-merch-christmas-nintendo-1851675507">The Pokémon Company</a></span> is releasing a new line of merchandise featuring Pokémon and art from the games, and there’s some real tempting stuff in the collection.</p><p>Some of the merch is game-neutral, whereas a few items have been made to spotlight characters and color schemes for either <em>Gold </em>or <em>Silver</em>. The highlights include plushes of game mascots Ho-Oh and Lugia, jackets with a reversible interior design of the Johto region map, and a trash can with the Japanese in-game message you receive when examining trash cans that roughly translates to “Nope, there’s only trash here” printed on it.</p><p>Right now, the line is only going on sale through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooixSl118ptVAz_Muj67LRmyAGy-hkGhr3M20XUPPFL4uHcvzjX&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooixSl118ptVAz_Muj67LRmyAGy-hkGhr3M20XUPPFL4uHcvzjX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese Pokémon Center</a></span> website, which always seems to get the best stuff. However, they will no doubt end up on reseller or import sites shortly after the line goes live on November 21. For now, you can click through to see all the merchandise set to go up next week.</p><p>These days, the easiest way to play <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver </em>is through the 3DS ports released in 2017. I’m still keeping my fingers crossed that Nintendo will one day put the old <em>Pokémon </em>games on Switch and then make a concerted effort to keep these games accessible moving forward, but the company’s lack of care on that front is well-documented.</p><p>Since it’s the 25th anniversary of <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em>, that means it’s also the 15th anniversary of the Nintendo DS remakes <em>Pokémon HeartGold </em>and <em>SoulSilver</em>, which launched during the original games’ 10th anniversary in 2009. Those remakes are still probably the game I’d put at the top of a ranking of the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games…oh, wait. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal

After all, Microsoft has form when it comes to mid-cycle hardware refreshes, offering a more powerful version of the Xbox One.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, though, times have changed, and while he failed to definitively rule out releasing a more powerful Xbox Series console, it doesn't sound likely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/gettyimages-2183768660-1731684332414.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer. Photo by Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Microsoft's gaming boss questioned the value of a mid-gen refresh, suggesting it is unnecessary given the diminishing returns developers are seeing with increased horsepower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think about hardware that can create unique value for our players or creators on our platform,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don’t need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t the first time Spencer has cast doubt on a possible Xbox mid-gen upgrade. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer doubled down on Microsoft’s focus on expanding Xbox’s audience via new devices, saying: "To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this doesn’t mean Microsoft is getting out of the console business. In fact, in the Rolling Stone interview Spencer confirmed: “we’ll definitely do more consoles in the future, and other devices.” What form they take, however, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-job-ad-confirms-upcoming-open-world-shooter-is-in-the-works-and-all-signs-point-to-starcraft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard is hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,” a new job ad has revealed — and all signs point to it being a StarCraft FPS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grd6c1/new_blizzard_open_world_shooter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, on November 13 Blizzard posted a <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job ad</a> for an Associate Design Director, Innovation on an unannounced game. The description goes into more detail:</p><blockquote>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting” – the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That blurb confirms Blizzard’s plan to release an open-world shooter, but what is it? In September, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">Blizzard was reportedly making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter</a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his new book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost"><u>StarCraft Ghost</u></a>, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv"><u>Diablo 4</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a>. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hay joined Ubisoft in 2011 to work on Far Cry 3, then became executive producer for the Far Cry brand, shipping Far Cry Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, and Far Cry Primal. Hay was creative director and executive producer on Far Cry 5 and executive director for Far Cry New Dawn and Far Cry 6 before joining Blizzard in 2022 as GM/VP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starcraft-remastered-and-starcraft-2-campaign-collection-confirmed-for-game-pass"><u>StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass</u></a>, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone. It looks like Blizzard is gearing up for something even bigger, though. Like, open-world bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It’s much cheaper than the Xbox Series X, but it lacks an optical drive and runs games at 1440p. That means you’ll have to rely solely on digital games, though the console is a great way to save a few bucks. It still plays all the same titles as Xbox Series X and works with Xbox Game Pass, making this current offer a great one for frugal shoppers. Remember that the deal doesn’t begin until November 21, and you’ll have until December 2 to cash in.</p>                      </div>   </div><p>Speaking of Xbox Game Pass, consider picking up this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Cloud Gaming Amazon Starter Kit</a> now that it’s on sale. Featuring an Xbox Sky Cipher Controller, 4K Fire Stick, and Game Pass Ultimate subscription, it’s a well-rounded bundle for just $75 (was $137). Along with a flashy controller and access to Game Pass Ultimate, you can choose between two different Fire Sticks--both of which support Cloud Streaming via Game Pass.</p><hr><p>Need to snag a controller for Player Two?

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 1 update just arrived, and the multiplayer shooter's new battle pass contains all manner of items to unlock and collect. One of them is a new emote called "Move Set" that appears to reference the viral breaker Raygun from the Paris 2024 Olympics this past summer.</p><p>The Move Set emote can be unlocked on Page 14 of the Season 1 battle pass. Check out the comparison video below from the account Detonated to see how the in-game emote compares to the real thing. Before this, <a href="https://www.today.com/news/sports/camryn-bynum-raygun-interception-vikings-rcna179607" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NFL player Camryn Bynum paid homage to Raygun's moves</a> with his own interception celebration.</p><p>Raygun, whose real name is Rachael Louis Gunn, is an Australian lecturer and professional breaker who competed at the Paris Olympic Games and <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/athlete/-raygun_1940107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">scored zero total points</a>. The 37-year-old's performances went viral, and afterwards, she was bullied and criticized.</p><p>Raygun was one of the most talked-about athletes from the Olympics, but after the Games, many expected her to parlay her fame into a new career path. However, she returned to her university teaching job and turned down offers to be on reality TV shows.</p><p>Raygun called the hate she received from her Olympic breaking performance <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/breakdancing-raygun-olympics-australia-social-media-reaction-1235754243/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pretty devastating."</a> The Australian breaking team defended RayGun and condemned the global online harassment campaign against her.</p><p>The Season 1 battle pass for Call of Duty includes a host of items, including a new operator, more weapons, additional skins, double XP tokens, and more. Check out the gallery below to see what's new in Season 1.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1 is now live, and includes loads of new features--one of which is a long-awaited mannequin Easter egg that players can unearth in the game's iconic Nuketown map.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who have played Nuketown before already know the drill: The map’s layout features a suburban neighborhood with model homes, winding picket fences, and freshly-cut lawns, all packed into a nuclear testing zone that gives off major Fallout vibes. Inhabited solely by mannequins, Nuketown has always been a place where secrets lurk, but Treyarch has kicked things up a notch this time around.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Warning: Spoilers ahead! Proceed with caution if you wish to experience the new Nuketown Easter egg without assistance.</em></p><p dir="ltr">To experience the Easter egg, players must shoot the head off of each mannequin. Some of them can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLTLJvSkI-M">a little bit tricky to find</a>, but once they've all been hunted down, a black-and-white "please stand by" message appears on screen for a moment. Once the message disappears, players will find themselves back in Nuketown… and no longer alone.</p><p dir="ltr">In the middle of the map, a group of mannequins can be seen peacefully sitting together, completely motionless, as if watching a television broadcast. Players who begin firing weapons at them, however, will soon face their wrath, as gunfire seemingly brings the mannequins to life. Members of the crowd will respond by throwing flashbangs at the player, but the real risk is located in the town itself. Once the Easter egg is activated, zombie-like mannequins will begin to spawn and chase players around the map. (Amusingly, the crowd of mannequins will also boo and cheer in response to players' actions.) The mannequins that aren't sitting in the stands move and groan like zombies, and if that isn't creepy enough, all the headless mannequins also remain on the map, frozen in place as the player fights off their non-beheaded counterparts.</p><p>Black Ops 6 players are having a great time with Nuketown's latest <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Mannequins" rel="nofollow ">mannequin-based secret</a>, with some <a href="https://x.com/Inkslasher/status/1857088919646466186" rel="nofollow ">posting footage</a> of their creepy nuclear test site adventures, and others <a href="https://x.com/ThePhoenixKng12/status/1857239937457828060" rel="nofollow ">sharing suggestions</a> for future Easter eggs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third and final entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will not shy away from the challenge of allowing players to fly freely around the map, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking during a panel today at G-Star 2024 going over the creation of the remake trilogy, the themes upon which each game was built, and more, as reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/638/G063881/20241115058/">4Gamer</a>, Director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small update on the third yet-to-be-named entry in the series. As far as development is concerned, the plot for the game has been completed, the concept decided, and the team is already working on it. The concept, in particular, is extremely important to the game but could not be revealed at the time.</p>
<p>The one thing about the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake that Hamaguchi-san could talk about was the map. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> provided a big map to explore, but with the introduction of the Highwind airship, the development team needs to allow players to experience the world from a higher perspective. He also added that they will not take any shortcuts to achieve this and will take on the challenge of being able to fly freely around the map.</p>
<p>Considering the vast majority of the Final Fantasy VII world was recreated for Rebirth, it will be very interesting how the development team will overcome the challenge of recreating the entire world while allowing players to fly freely around it and make it interesting even when revisiting locations that were already explored in the second entry in the series. As the development team definitely exceeded expectations with Rebirth, in my opinion, there's little doubt they will be able to do so again with the third game that will conclude the story.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we'll have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-arcane">Patrick Recommends... <em>Arcane</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Streaming On:</strong> Netflix<br><strong>Number of Episodes:</strong> 18 (nine in season one, nine in season two)<br><strong>Hours I've Spent Playing <em>League of Legends</em>:</strong> 0<br><strong>Why Aren't We Getting More <em>Scavengers Reign</em>?:</strong> I don't know, man</p><p>Let me be clear: I do not care for MOBAs. In fact, they irritate me because it means there is time and money being spent on building MOBAs when those people could, in theory, be making anything else. But this is the world we live in. People deserve happiness, even if I question whether one should find salvation within a MOBA. </p><p>Jokes aside, do not let the<em> League of Legends</em> branding scare you off. I almost let that happen, but doing so would've robbed me of one of the best animated shows...<em>ever</em>? I feel comfortable saying that. <em>Arcane</em> does not require one drop of experience with its source material, and entirely succeeds on the merits of the storytelling happening in the show. I'm sure there are easter eggs about, but it never humiliates you for not knowing a lick about<em> League of Legends</em>, and delivers a gorgeous and heart-pounding mashup of steampunk and politics.</p><p><em>Arcane</em> is almost good enough to make me consider trying the game. Almost.</p><p>On, and like the<em> Spider-Verse </em>movies, <em>Arcane</em> suggests the Pixar and DreamWorks-ification of computer animation has been holding us back for decades. There's so much more than what we've seen so far.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommendsplus-one">Rob Recommends...<em>Plus One</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Streaming On</strong>: Hulu<br><strong>Runtime:</strong> 1h38m<br><strong>Who It's For</strong>: People who loved <em>Before Midnight</em><br><strong>Cooter Status: </strong>Out</p><p>This flew under my radar until we we were at a loss for what to watch last month and just grabbed something Hulu was pushing on our home page. On the off chance you never heard of it, I'll give you my pitch for 2019's <em>Plus One</em>.</p><p><em>Plus One </em>is superficially about as by-the-numbers a romantic comedy as you can get. Two platonic friends are staring down the barrel of a wedding season from hell and decide to go as one another's dates for the entire year. Maya Erskine's Alice has just had a long relationship evaporate, and Jack Quaid's Matt is struggling with his fear that he will never meet anyone he can be confident in having a long, committed relationship with. You know what's going to happen next.</p><p>Except it happens about halfway through the film and most of the customary obstacles are dispensed with pretty quickly. An almost accidental casual hookup turns into a relationship with only a little tension and awkwardness... and then things go catastrophically and painfully wrong between Matt and Alice. Not in a cute way, not based on a simple misunderstanding that could cleared up with a conversation or a message. They go wrong because the ways Matt and Alice are messy and dysfunctional, though undeniably funny for much of the film, are neither harmless nor cute.</p><p>Most romantic comedies don't go this route. They keep their leads' flaws squarely in the relatable-but-harmless realm. The romantic pairing almost break-up because they just can't trust each other—and love itself—to open themselves up to embracing what is right in front of their eyes! The thing few of them get into is that love—or maybe the commitment part of it—really is scary. It can go bad. It <em>will </em>go bad. The question is what people decide to do next.</p><p><em>Plus One </em>gives us two characters who are protecting themselves and each other from a lot of pain and loneliness at the start of the movie, and almost against their will they open up to each other and in the process start handing the other person direct access to all their deepest fears and doubts... and almost immediately they devastate each other. For bad, self-sabotaging, but <em>entirely coherent and understandable </em>reasons. Matt and Alice might be characters in a comedy but the script from writer-directors Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer takes them very seriously <em>as people</em>. Erskine is, as always, sensational and absolutely nails both the broadest comedic moments of the film and the most painful dramatic ones, but Quaid is well-matched as a someone who is slowly revealed to be the the worst kind of man-child, convinced of his own kindness and maturity as he takes a nose-dive into his own hidden pathology. Understanding and self-knowledge arrive late for him in the form of a beautiful and hilarious scene with his father, played by Ed Begley, Jr. who deftly pivots his character from being the film's broadest source of comic relief to giving its thesis on what it really means for a relationship to succeed or fail.</p><p>The rest of the film is similarly iconoclastic. The photography (by Guy Godfree) and direction form eschew the saturated warm colors and aspirational sets of most contemporary romantic comedies and go for location shooting with a cooler and almost documentary feel. Matt and Alice spend time in shitty hotel rooms, dire motor courts, and empty parking lots and alleys. One of the big romantic breakthroughs takes place at a resort hotel perpetually blanketed by a cloying marine layer. The two characters are lunging for a relationship as the last light is fading. As funny and at times bawdy as <em>Plus One </em>is, it invites comparisons with Linklater's <em>Before </em>trilogy, and it's a good enough film that the comparison isn't an embarrassing one.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-mubi">Cado Recommends...

First up, treat yourself to the aesthetic and emotional grandiosity of <em>The Fall, </em>which has just been remastered in 4k and screened at select theaters across the country. If you were unable to make one of these screenings, at least you've got Mubi as the (as of this writing) only place you can stream the 4k remaster at home. </p><p>Perhaps you're like me and are already missing the spooky vibes of an October that came and went too quickly. Well, Mubi's got you again with my personal favorite horror movie I watched this year, <em>The Substance.</em> Show up for the commentary on the treatment of women in Hollywood, stay for the absolutely wild body horror!</p><p>Aside from these two great films, I've also added a number of movies to my watch list to try and make the best out of this month of cinema. It's been too long since I've watched <em>La Jetée, </em>time for a refresher! Oops, I never saw <em>The Godfather</em>, might as well fix that! Who doesn't love a casual rewatch of <em>Stalker</em>? </p><p>Honestly, with the amount of interesting fresh-from-the-festival-circuit movies that exist, I'm already gearing up to need a little more Mubi in my life.</p>

<p>The Splinter Cell movie that was slated to star Tom Hardy has been cancelled, according to one of the film’s producers.</p>



<p>Twelve years after it was first reported as in development, producer Basil Iwanyk was asked about the state of the movie. In his response to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Iwanyk confirmed that the movie wasn’t happening due to not being able to “get it right”.</p>



<p>“That movie would have been awesome… Just couldn’t get it right, script-wise, budget-wise,” Iwanyk said. “But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. </p>



<p>“That’s one of the ones that got away, which is really sad.”</p>



<p>The news of the movie’s demise shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Since being announced over a decade ago, there had been nary an update on it’s status. It’s likely that most fans that heard about it complete forgot by now.</p>



<p>If the cancellation of the Splinter Cell movie has you upset, however, don’t be too upset. Ubisoft is continuing work on its remake of the first Splinter Cell, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently targeting for a 2026 release date</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Splinter Cell movie being cancelled? Let us know below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment, known for fantastical RPGs like The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, returns in 2025 with a first-person RPG that many believe may rival The Elder Scrolls. That may feel a little generous, but if you’ve ever played Pillars of Eternity, then you know the team is adept at world-building and lore, making for a truly unique and captivating role-playing game experience. But for now, we must wait and prepare. To that end, here’s your first look at the Avowed system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-these-are-the-avowed-pc-system-requirements">These Are the Avowed PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>We’re still months from the release of Avowed, but Obsidian Entertainment finally unveiled the game’s system requirements ahead of time. Overall, they’re relatively approachable, especially on the low end, but man, storage space requirements have quickly ballooned in size in recent years. You’ll soon need an entire SSD for a single game, just you wait and see!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements-nbsp">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements-nbsp">Recommended System Requirements&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Graphics: AMD RX 6800 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-play-while-we-wait-for-avowed">What to Play While We Wait for Avowed</h2>



<p>Seeing as Avowed doesn’t release until February 18, we still have a few months until we can dive into the fantasy world. That’s plenty of time to beat another large-scale RPG or two in the meantime. To help you prepare, we recommend the following RPGs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Outer Worlds doesn’t take too long to complete, but you can easily spend hundreds of hours exploring every nook and cranny in all of the other recommendations!</p>



<p>What other titles would you recommend while we wait for Avowed? Let us know in the comments below, or start a thread about the upcoming RPG in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Speaking of the upcoming RPG, according to Phil Spencer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed wasn’t delayed due to the game’s quality</a> but for other reasons instead!</p>

<p><em>It's&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>&nbsp;week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>The time has finally come to close one of the most notable gaps in my gaming history. Despite more than a decade of writing about video games and even more years enjoying them, I never got around to playing <em>Half-Life 2</em>.</p>
<p>Not only have I not played it, but I've managed to keep myself in the dark about pretty much everything to do with it. I always assumed that one day I would get around to playing this classic, and I wanted the experience to be as close as possible to it would have been back in 2004. So my only knowledge about <em>Half-Life 2</em> before starting this project was 1) the game is set in the same universe as <em>Portal</em>, a game I love, 2) the protagonist is named Gordon Freeman, and he looks uncannily like a silent, spectacled young Hugh Laurie, and 3) there's something called the Gravity Gun.</p>
<p>That's it. I didn't even know exactly what the Gravity Gun did, only that it existed.</p>
<p>So, the time has come for me to learn what the fuss is all about. I've cataloged my off-the-cuff reactions as well as my more analytical thoughts about <em>Half-Life 2</em>, both as a standalone project and as a catalyst for setting new standards in design. But if you're looking for the TL;DR of whether I think the game holds up, my answer is: it depends.</p>
<h2>Beginning a classic with a clunk</h2>
<p>A red letter day indeed! Time to experience this iconic piece of video game history. I spend most of the intro sequence in the train station soaking in the atmosphere of the dystopian City 17. A few minutes in, though, I think I'm supposed to sneak past a guard. Because I'm a fugitive trying to escape this freaky Big Brother building, and I swear Barney told me to avoid detection. Instead, the guard immediately sees me and whomps me on the head for not putting a bottle into the trash. Not an auspicious beginning.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I make it to Dr. Kleiner's lab for a little bit of story exposition. I like this rag-tag group of geniuses and the whole vibe of a secret scientific rebellion. I also appreciate that it's not a static cutscene, so I can poke around the lab while I listen or observe the characters interacting.</p>
<p>After a failed teleport and getting a crowbar from Barney, I then spend a long time getting shot and dying in a train yard. Like, an embarrassingly long time. Perhaps I was assuming at this early stage that <em>Half-Life 2</em> would be like <em>Portal</em> with real guns, because I figured this area had to be a puzzle. I'm not sure how I missed the one portion of the environment that I could slip through, but I convinced myself that I was supposed to leap across the tops of the train cars, <em>Frogger</em> style. And Gordon might have many skills, but his jumping leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>Finally, I realize that there's a gap in the cars, and I move along. This canal setting is striking, but I keep being unsure which areas of the map I can access. I've heard that the level design is one of the most lauded parts of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, but this is proving to be a genuine struggle with the game.</p>
<p>When I played <em>Portal</em>, I sometimes was unsure how to progress, but because that game is presented in the austere confines of a science experiment, I felt like I was supposed to be challenged. In <em>Half-Life 2</em>, though, where there are higher stakes and I'm running for my life, getting stuck just makes me feel dumb and annoyed. And I'm doubly annoyed because this escape sequence would probably feel amazing if I didn't keep getting lost. Again, not the thrilling start I was hoping for.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Killing a barnacle by feeding it an explosive barrel is a definite high point. I may have cackled. This is the sort of clever environmental interaction I expected to see from the minds that later made <em>Portal</em>.</p>
<p>Headcrabs, on the other hand, are just obnoxious. My dinky little pea shooter pistol doesn't feel like great protection. What's a rogue physicist gotta do to get a shotgun?</p>

<h2>From airboats to zombies</h2>
<p>After a break, I return armed with a renewed determination to grok this game and, more importantly, with an airboat. For 90 percent of the Water Hazard chapter, I am feeling like a badass. I'm cruising in my watery ride, flying over ramps, and watching a silo collapse overhead. Especially in those rare moments when the 2000s electro jams punctuate my fights, I feel like a true action hero.</p>

      The airboat sequence was divisive in 2004, but this writer enjoyed it.

<p>Next I reach the Black Mesa East chapter, which is a perfect interlude. The game's approach to world-building is probably the area where my feelings align most closely with those of <em>Half-Life 2</em> veterans. It is spectacular. Heading down into the lab may be the best elevator ride I've taken in a game. Judith is talking science, and outside the shaft, I see humans and vortigaunts conducting fascinating experiments. Small vignettes like those are a perfect way to introduce more information about the rebellion. They give subtle context to a game that doesn't do much to explain itself and doesn't need to.</p>
<p>Also, Dog is the best boy. Seriously, I've seen modern games where the animations didn't have as much personality as when Alyx treats her robot protector like an actual dog, and he shakes in delight. My only sadness is that Dog doesn't accompany me to Ravenholm.</p>

          
                  </div>

      Dog is, in fact, the best boy.

      </figure>

<p>I do wish Dog had come with me to Ravenholm. I learned after the fact that this chapter is one of the most iconic and beloved, but I had the opposite reaction. Survival horror is not my jam. These whirling death traps are sweet, but I hate jump scares, and I don't love any of my weapons for the encounters.</p>
<p>That brings me to something I don't want to say, but in the spirit of journalistic honesty, I must: I don't adore the Gravity Gun. Obviously it was the game's signature creation here and probably what most of you recall most fondly, but I did not fully grasp its potential immediately. Based on the tutorial in Black Mesa East, I assumed it would mostly be a component to puzzle-solving and traversal rather than a key part of combat. I only started using it as a weapon in Ravenholm because I ran out of ammo for everything else.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't get the appeal. Slicing zombies up with a saw blade or bashing them with paint cans is satisfying—no complaints there. But I found the tool inconsistent, which discouraged me from experimenting as much as the developers may have hoped. I'm pretty sure I do as much damage to myself as to enemies trying to lob exploding barrels. I want to be able to fling corpses around and can't (for reasons that became apparent later, but in the moment felt limiting). Later chapters reinforced my uncertainty, when I couldn't pull a car to me, yet a push blast had enough power to overturn the vehicle.</p>
<p>And once again, I had a rough time with navigation. Maybe I was missing what other people would have seen as obvious cues, the way I'm attuned to finding climbing paths marked by color in modern games—controversial as that yellow marking convention may be, its absence is noted when you're struggling to read the environment with a visual language for the game that emphasizes realism over readability. Or maybe I've gotten over-reliant on the tools of the sprawling RPGs I favor these days, where you have a mini-map and quest markers to help you manage all the threads. But for an agonizingly long time, I stared at an electrified fence and wires that seemed to lead to nowhere before realizing that I was supposed to enter the building where Father Grigori first appeared on the balcony. A giant bonfire of corpses out front seemed like a clear 'do not enter' sign, so it didn't occur to me that I could go inside. Alas.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Speaking of which, Father Grigori is the best part of the section. He's a total bro, giving me a shotgun at long last. I feel kind of bad when I just abandon him to his murderous flock at the end of the chapter. I hope he survives?</p>
<h2>Familiarity and finding my footing</h2>
<p>The new weapons are coming fast and furious now. I'm impressed at how good the combat feel is. I like the pulse rifle a lot, and that has become my go-to for most long-distance enemies. I wish I could aim down sights, but at least this feels impactful at range. Although I don't usually favor the slow cadence of a revolver in other games, I also enjoy the magnum. The SMG serves well as a workhorse, while the rocket launcher and crossbow are satisfying tools when the right situation arises.</p>
<p>But my favorite weapon, far more than the Gravity Gun, is the shotgun. Especially at point-blank range and into a fast zombie's head. Chef's kiss. Maybe it's my love of <em>Doom (2016)</em> peeking through, but any time I can go charging into a crowd with my shotgun, I'm a happy camper.</p>
<p>While the worldbuilding in <em>Half-Life 2</em> is stellar, I don't think the writing matches that high. Just about every brief encounter with allies starts with someone breathlessly gasping, "Gordon? Gordon Freeman?" It's the sort of repetition that would make for an effective and dangerous drinking game.</p>
<p>I was surprised when I entered another vehicle section. I liked the airboat, even though the chapter ran a touch long, but this dune buggy feels a lot jankier. At least it starts with a gun attached.</p>
<p>I love the idea of this magnet crane puzzle. I wish it didn't control like something from <em>Octodad</em>, but I do get my buggy up out of the sand.</p>

          
                  </div>

      The "floor is lava" sequence involves placing objects with the Gravity Gun to avoid disturbing an army of angry antlions by stepping on the sand.

      </figure>

<p>Things start turning around for me once I reach the sandy version of 'the floor is lava.' That's a cute idea. Although I keep wanting to rotate objects and have a more controlled placement with the Gravity Gun like I could when I did these kinds of tasks with the Ultrahand ability during <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. I understand that <em>Half-Life 2</em> crawled so <em>TotK</em> could run, but that knowledge doesn't mean I have a better time using the mechanic. Toward the end of the sequence, I got bored by the slow pace of creating a bridge and just barrelled ahead, willing to face a firefight just to move things along.</p>
<p>At this point, however, things take a decided turn for the better when I get my other favorite weapon of the game: My own antlion army! Commanding them is so fabulously ridiculous. The scene where hordes of antlions leap over high walls to attack gunmen on the towers leading into Nova Prospekt may be my favorite moment so far in the entire game. If this is how all of you felt flinging radiators around with the Gravity Gun back in the day, then I get why you love it so. I'm sure I won't be able to keep this glorious power indefinitely, but I would happily finish the rest of the story with just antlions and a shotgun if they'd let me.</p>
<p>The Nova Prospekt area is the first time I really see a clear line connecting <em>Half-Life 2</em> to <em>Portal</em>. None of the puzzles or characters thus far gave me <em>Portal</em> vibes, but I definitely get them here, especially once turrets come into play. By this point, I'm finally navigating the space with some confidence. That might be the result of logging enough hours or maybe it was just the sense that GLaDOS could start talking to me at any moment. Whatever the reason, I think I'm finding my groove at last.</p>

    <p>
      Nova Prospekt is one of the first areas Valve made when it developed <em>Half-Life 2</em>, so it's not surprising it bears a lot of similarity to environments and vibes in both the original <em>Half-Life</em> and in <em>Portal</em>.

      </figure>

<p>Somehow I am not surprised by Judith's sudden but inevitable betrayal in this chapter. Alyx not getting along with her in the Black Mesa East chapter felt pretty telling. But then she's just going to let Judith enter teleport coordinates unsupervised? Alyx, you're supposed to be smart!</p>
<p>What do you know—now Judith has re-kidnapped Eli. Color me shocked.</p>

<h2>Onward and upward to the end</h2>
<p>It's nice having human minions. They're no antlions, but I like how the world has shifted to a real uprising. It reminds me of the big charge at the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, running and gunning through a bombed-out city with bug-like baddies overhead.</p>
<p>Snipers are not a welcome addition to the enemy roster. Not sure why Barney's whining so much. You could throw some grenades, too, my dude.</p>
<p>Barney tags along with my minions as we reach the Overwatch Nexus. Destroying floor turrets is probably the first time I've struggled with combat. These are the least precise grenades of all time. Once we make it through the interior sequence, it's time to face down the striders. I can't imagine how you'd play this section bringing down the swarm of them on a harder difficulty. My health takes a beating as I run around the wreckage desperately looking for ammo reloads and medkits. In theory, this is probably a great setpiece, but I'm just stressed out. Things go a little better once the combat is paired with traversal, and the final showdown on the roof does feel like a gratifying close to a boss fight.</p>
<p>On to the Citadel. Why on earth would I get into one of these pods? That's a terrible idea. But apparently that's what I'm going to do. I hope I'm not supposed to be navigating this pod in any way, because I'm just taking in the vibes. It's another transit moment with glimpses into what the enemies have been getting up to while the rebellion rages outside. It's eerie; I like it.</p>

<p>The Gravity Gun is the core of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, so it makes sense that a supercharged version is all I have for the final push. I appreciate that I can use it to fling bodies, but my reaction is a little muted since this was an idea I'd had from the start. But I do find the new angle of sucking up energy orbs to be pretty rad.</p>
<p>I arrive in Dr. Breen's office, and it looks grim for our heroes. Judith redeeming herself surprises me more than her betrayal, which is nice. When he runs off, I'm mentally preparing myself as I chase him for a final boss showdown. Surely, something extra bonkers with the Gravity Gun awaits me. I climb the teleportation tower, I pelt Breen's device with energy orbs, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, and…</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<h2>Context is everything</h2>
<p>In the moment, I was torn between feeling that the opaque ending was genius and that it was an absolute cop-out. It was certainly not how I expected the game to end.</p>
<p>But on reflection, that wound up being a fitting final thought as the credits rolled, because I think 'expectations' were at the heart of my conflicted reactions to finally playing <em>Half-Life 2</em>. I've rarely felt so much pressure to have a particular response. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to share the awe that so many players feel for it. I wanted to have an epic experience that matched the epic legacy <em>Half-Life 2</em> has in gaming history.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>Instead, I had whiplash, swinging between moments of delight and stretches of being stymied or even downright pissed off. I was tense, often dreading rather than eagerly awaiting each next twist. Aside from a handful of high points, I'm not sure I'd say playing <em>Half-Life 2</em> was fun.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>As I mentioned at the start, the big question I felt I had to answer was whether <em>Half-Life 2</em> felt relevant today or whether it only holds up under the rosy glow of nostalgia. And my answer is, "It depends." As an enigmatic person once said, "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world." It's all in the context.</p>
<p>Moments that were jaw-dropping in 2004 have less impact for someone like me who's played the many titles that copied, standardized, and perfected <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s revelations. Intellectually, I understand that the Gravity Gun was a literal game-changer and that a physics engine deployed at this scale was unheard of. But funnily enough, a modern player is even less likely to see those innovations as so, well, innovative when a game has as much polish as <em>Half-Life 2</em> does. <em>Half-Life 2</em> has almost no rough edges in the execution. Everything works the way it was intended.</p>
<p>Since that polish means the new ideas don't feel like experiments, and since I've seen them in other games in the intervening years, they don't register as notable.</p>
<p>Just as you don't need to be a fan of Aristotle's Poetics to appreciate drama, you don't need to love <em>Half-Life 2</em> to appreciate its legacy. As a fun game to play, whether it holds up will come down to you and your context. However, as a showcase of the technology of the time and a masterclass in world-building, yes, <em>Half-Life 2</em> holds up today.</p>

                <p>Thunderful Games, the developer of the SteamWorld series, has announced 80-100 layoffs at the company and a reshifting focus for third-party games. In a <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the company said the layoffs were part of a "restructuring." Along with the layoffs, an unspecified number of game projects were officially canceled.</p><p>CEO of Thunderful Martin Walfisz said that the decision came with regret, but this isn't the first time the company has seen layoffs this year. Back in January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-publisher-thunderful-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/1100-6520404/" data-ref-id="1100-6520404">Thunderful saw 20% of the company's staff laid off</a> in a similar "restructuring," something that Walfisz acknowledges and saw as unavoidable.</p><p>"It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience," Walfisz said. "The strategic move towards publishing games from external partners allows us to reduce fixed costs, increase flexibility, and better control our cash flow. We have many talented and dedicated employees, and it is with great regret that we are forced to part ways."</p><p>According to the press release, the projections for money saved from these reductions will gain 80-90 MSEK (approximately $7.3-8.2 million), but it doesn't expect the majority of these savings to take effect until the first quarter of 2025. The restructuring program will be implemented immediately.</p><p>As for refocusing on external games, the company said that it hopes it will help reduce fixed costs and allow for a higher turnout rate, but still retain some internal development capacity, which includes games like the SteamWorld series and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lost-in-random-review-six-appeal/1900-6417731/" data-ref-id="1900-6417731">Lost in Random</a>.</p><p>Thunderful's recent release, SteamWorld Heist 2, was released back in August and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/search/steamworld%20heist%202/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned rather good reviews</a>, including at GameSpot where it received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-2-review-like-clockwork/1900-6418264/" data-ref-id="1900-6418264">9/10</a>.</p>

After vacationing in Japan for a couple of weeks and spending very little time thinking about video games or the wider world, I returned to an industry still besieged by rampant layoffs and CEO shithousery. It was a predictable and rather depressing plummet back towards reality. Combine that with the foul news that Hannibal Lecter's biggest sycophant will be returning to the White House in 2025, and, well, I didn't quite have the energy or motivation to write this column last week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My initial idea was to break down why the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/netflix-games-exec-prepares-bowl-of-word-salad-to-announce-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">perpetual cacophony of generative AI word chunder</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has filled me with despair, but I figured there's enough anger and frustration in the world right now. Instead, I want to talk about a wholesome series of events that shows how video games can send positivity rippling throughout the cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But first, some quick context:</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokemon TCG Pocket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is doing the business right now. The mobile card battler has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-topped-30-million-downloads-worldwide">surpassed 30 million downloads</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a couple of weeks and has likely earned a fair bit of brass by limiting people to a meager two free booster packs per day. I've yet to drop cash on the title, but I'm absolutely drinking the sugary sweet cool aid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To ward off the insatiable urge to rip open virtual boosters, I threw myself into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TCG Pocket's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> multiplayer mode. After building my own custom decks (I'm running a fast-hitting Pikachu EX setup), I got stuck in and to my surprise began racking up plenty of wins. I was, in my humble opinion, a latent tactical genius who's calling in life was to become the ultimate Pokemon trainer. Unimpeded by self-doubt or any notion of reality, I decided my recent success within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TCG Pocket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would justify a splurge on the real thing: actual, tangible, mouth-watering Pokemon Cards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You see, in Japan, Pokemon cards were a dime a dozen. Pop into any konbini and you'll see booster packs loitering by the counter, begging to be taken home and tenderly torn asunder. Ideally while scoffing a custard bun and guzzling Pocari Sweat. I happily obliged. It's easy to succumb to such indulgent whims when you're half a world away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hard cut back to damp, miserable Blighty and I told myself it was over. I'd slide my Japanese cards in a binder and make a clean break. But before I could close the door on that fleeting fixation, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TCG Pocket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> quickly pulled me back in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so, filled with purpose and a desire to see if I could replicate my </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TCG Pocket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> success in the real world, I ambled down to my local tabletop game store to ask for advice on how to start playing Pokemon TCG proper. I was told to pre-order a Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box (which comes with competition-legal dice, a bunch of boosters, damage counters, and everything else you need to start battling) and the upcoming Charizard EX League Battle Deck. I was also told to head back down to the store on Monday evening to check out the weekly Pokemon League and learn the ropes. Good shouts all round.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, inserting yourself into a new space without any kind of social support can be a nerve-wracking experience at the best of times. Would I fit in or immediately be outed as an upstart pretender. Fresh meat for the salivating, card-toting wolves. Eventually, I pushed my flickering anxieties aside and returned, but only after cobbling together a haphazard 60-card deck that I felt, at the very least, would be able to knock out a few 'mons before being overpowered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I arrived (rather sheepishly) on Monday evening, the players were already downstairs excitedly discussing their latest pulls, searching for fabled illustration rares, and partaking in a few practice bouts in preparation for the real thing. I wondered how to go about introducing myself to what seemed like a rather tight-knit group, but before that thought could become even remotely corporeal I was excitedly ushered into the fold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Within moments of being initiated, I was made to feel like a part of the furniture. It was as if I'd been going there for years. A veteran player insisted I take some of their cards to bolster my deck (a quick practice game unearthed more than a few deficiencies) and taught me how to hone my approach and practice good tournament etiquette. During the tournament, each opponent I sat opposite graciously answered my flurry of (no doubt rudimentary) questions and took the time to carefully explain the minutiae of certain plays.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was absolutely battered on occasion, but there are lessons in defeat and I was eager to learn. I played four games overall, losing two, drawing one, and winning another—with that victory coming at the very end of the evening. It was the perfect cap on a wholesome foray into the unknown. The small acts of kindness I experienced sent me home feeling marginally less cynical about the world, and that's a staggering achievement given just how utterly fucked everything is at the minute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an industry that appears to be sinking under a tidal wave of corporate and neo-political bullshit, it can often feel like we're slipping under the surface while blindly scrambling for a life raft. There's a lot to be cynical about right now—and that skepticism is vital in the face of an industry that appears to grow more uncaring by the minute—but video games can still manifest positivity and foster real connections, sometimes just not in the ways you might expect.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-strike-in-protest-of-microsoft-remote-work-and-outsourcing-policies">ZeniMax union workers strike in protest of Microsoft remote work and outsourcing policies </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">// A huge number of ZeniMax staffers aren't happy with some of the decisions being made by their parent company Microsoft.

            <p>Fans think they've spotted something exciting in the latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> teaser, suggesting a new Horizon-themed set may be on the way.</p>
<p>In a new behind-the-scenes video in which Lego Horizon Adventures creators "share their experience of building Aloy's world brick by brick", eagle-eyed fans realised that the Aloy minifig shown right at the end of the teaser is not quite like any we've seen before.</p>
<p>You can see the minifig concerned at the nine-minute mark in the video embedded below:</p>

<p>As posited by <a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-teases-future-lego-horizon-sets/">The Brick Fan</a>, this minifig appears to have an "updated printing" from the Aloy included in the Tallneck <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> Lego set released a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Whilst this alone in no way implies a new Lego set is <em>definitely</em> on the way, the new Aloy variant isn't the only brick-shaped leak we've seen recently. Reliable Lego leaker Clay_Bricks goes even further, not only revealing that the set will feature Aloy &amp; Varl vs Shell-Walker &amp; Sawtooth, we've even got a kit number and a release date: 77037 and March 2025.</p>
<p>In the slideshow appended to the reddit post, we get another peek at that hitherto unknown Aloy minifig:</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In a special developer live stream today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-still-in-pre-production-bioware-passes-star-wars-the-old-republic-new-dev/">Star Wars: The Old Republic team</a> announced the next major update that will be arriving to the MMORPG, with the update being titled Game Update 7.6 - Galactic Threads. This is set to be a relatively significant update, as a lot of new features and content will be added, as well as character art modernization. The update will begin to roll out in December to players across the globe, with the story missions arriving in Star Wars: The Old Republic in 2025.</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic was first released in 2011, and since then has evolved a fair amount, with there being plenty of content for Star Wars fans to get stuck into. One of the most important features being added in the Galactic Threads update is the modernization of the character and planet art. This is something that has been in the works for a while, but updating all of the models and planets is very time consuming. While the updates on modernizing the graphics are slow, players will be able to see texture changes to models such as the Human, Chiss, Cyborg, and Miralukan, bringing improved fidelity to the game. To showcase the changes that have been made, the SWTOR team has released a YouTube video that shows off the graphical updates they have been working on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet and Character Model Modernization coming to Game Update 7.6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WN7JD4pTpks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, there is a ton more coming to the game aside from just this update. This includes new story missions that carry on straight from the Desperate Defiance storyline. Of course, these missions won't be rolled out until 2025, but players will at least be given time to get excited about them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the update will add a new boss fight called The Propagator Core XR-53, a new lair boss that will launch in Story and Veteran difficulties. Alongside this, there will be brand-new Dynamic Encounters, world content dedicated to immersing players in the exploration of the worlds they inhabit. The Dynamic Encounters will vary, depending on where you are and what you are doing. This could include having to take out Hidden Chain forces or herding together Banthas, who escaped. If you want to get stuck in, these encounters will first be arriving on Hoth and Tatooine, offering a bounty of rewards for players to earn.</p>
<p>If you want to know every last detail about what you can expect about the upcoming update to Star Wars: The Old Republic, <a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20241114-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> has all of the info about what you can expect and some of the smaller features being added to the MMORPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamemaker-25th-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Game creation engine GameMaker is 25 years old today, and to celebrate, the software suite's developers have released a free game that you can play on Steam right now.</p>

<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>is a management sim in which you must manage the development house creating GameMaker. Whoa, recursive.</p>

<p>You'll have to keep your employees happy, choose which features to add to your game creation engine, and upgrade your office in order to keep worker productivity at a maximum. Along the way, you'll also collect "posters based on the history of GameMaker".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamemaker-25th-anniversary-free-game-release.jpg?itok=H1djkgP1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamemaker-25th-anniversary-free-game-release.jpg?itok=yitBjc2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>asks how you would do managing your very own game creation suite.</figcaption></figure><p>Creator YoYo Games (which is, believe it or not, also the company responsible for making GameMaker) describes&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>as a "minigame-filled, top-down management and strategy game".</p>

<p>The game has a lot in common with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-dev-story-other-kairosoft-games-now-on-steam" rel="nofollow">Game Dev Story</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>, although this one's based more around creating creation software itself rather than the games made with said software.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>was also made in GameMaker, and YoYo Games says it intends to make the source code assets and project files free to GameMaker users soon in the form of a template for the software kit.</p>

<p>It's all part of celebrating GameMaker's 25th year on our storied planet. You can read a blog post detailing what else YoYo has in the pipeline for GameMaker as part of these anniversary celebrations <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-25" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here if you're interested</a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what GameMaker is, it's a game creation toolkit that specializes in creating 2D games across all current major platforms.</p>

<p>Some of the games that have been made using GameMaker include all-time classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/undertale" rel="nofollow"><em>Undertale</em></a>, cozy farming sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fields-of-mistria" rel="nofollow"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>, and ultra-violent arcade action game&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, to name but a few.</p>

<p>GameMaker is free to use on a non-commercial basis; the transition from paid to free was made last year, at which point YoYo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamemaker-free-non-commercial-use" rel="nofollow">also seemingly took a swipe at Unity</a>, which was, at the time, going through a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" rel="nofollow">major controversy surrounding a runtime fee</a> for developers.</p>

<p>You can download GameMaker and get started with it via the tool's <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>is currently available to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219220/GameMaker_25th_Anniversary/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

While not shocking, the reassurance comes after this fall’s big holiday Xbox console exclusive, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></span>, announced a PS5 port coming just a few months later in the spring. The multiplatform push has had some fans  doubting the platform’s future, especially when Spencer says things like there’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549">no red line</a></span>” when it comes to bringing first-party games to rival consoles, including the next <em>Halo</em>. </p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously teased</a></span> that Microsoft’s next Xbox would be the “largest technical leap” players have ever seen in a console generation. And this week Spencer confirmed that the company is working on a dedicated PC gaming handheld, though it’s still a few years off. Previous leaks pegged a new Xbox console coming in late 2026, and while plans can always change, it certainly sounds like Microsoft remains all-in on hardware for the next 5-10 years, even if the success of those devices isn’t ultimately propelled first and foremost by exclusive franchises like <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>and <em>Gears of War</em>.</p><p>And what of Microsoft skipping the mid-cycle refresh? Unlike last time when its Xbox Series X and the PS4 Pro went head-to-head, Sony’s spiffed-up, $700 gaming rig has launched uncontested this year. Spencer’s answer is that the improvements just don’t warrant an incremental update this time around. “We think about hardware that can create unique value for our players or creators on our platform,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “We don’t need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit.”</p><p>He continued, “Does a new device really give you a unique experience onscreen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits.” That echoed a comment he made to <em>Bloomberg</em> this week as well about reaching new audiences. “We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles,” Spencer said. </p><p>Those implied shots at the PS5 Pro come after months of debate about whether Sony’s second-most-expensive console ever seems worth it for slightly better resolutions at higher framerates. While experts and diehard enthusiasts are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">singing the praises</a></span> of the device for improving games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>, others have noted that even being a little too far away from the screen or dealing with daytime glare from windows all but cancels out that upgrade. </p><p>Of course, if Sony is struggling to showcase meaningful improvements with new hardware that’s $300 more than the all-digital PS5 was at launch, how exactly are we going to get the “largest technical leap you’ve ever seen” out of the next Xbox at an affordable price? Maybe machine learning, generative AI, and cloud computing, which Microsoft is currently all-in on, will provide a unique solution to that dilemma. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Blizzard is hiring for an unannounced upcoming open-world shooter game. A job ad posted on November 13 revealed this, though the requisition doesn't have too many details about what the game is.</p><p>The<a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> job ad for the Associate Design Director, Innovation</a> says this person will be the "vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations" for the upcoming unannounced "open-world shooter game."</p><p>The job calls for someone to help implement strategies that have "shown potential but have not yet permeated the AAA space." The successful candidate will work with Blizzard's engineering, art, and audio teams to help guide the project from concept to release. This wording specifically suggests whatever this game is, it might be early in development.</p><p>According to the job listing (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-starcraft-reports-blizzard-is-hiring-for-an-open-world-shooter-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), a successful candidate can expect to earn a minimum annual salary of $124,400, with the potential of reaching $230,300.</p><p>This job ad was only posted this week, but journalist Jason Schreier's new book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment, contained a passage mentioning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-trying-to-make-a-starcraft-shooter-again/1100-6526763/" data-ref-id="1100-6526763">a StarCraft shooter is, or was, in development at Blizzard</a>. Whether or not this newly posted job ad is connected to that is unknown.</p><p>The rumored StarCraft shooter was said to be led by Dan Hay, the former Ubisoft and Far Cry veteran who joined Blizzard as vice president and general manager in 2022.</p><p>As part of the iterative nature of game development, Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about 50% of the games it works on</a>, so whatever new Blizzard shooter is in development, it's not guaranteed to release.

		<p>It’s been slower going than I’d hoped with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> enhanced lineup of games, as I wrangle together all the video clips and comparison points I need. I’m close to completing our Insomniac games round-up though, and I’m convinced that they’re the single best development studio out there this generation. Who else has managed to deliver three games in four years, pushing the boundaries for console graphics and world building each time, and reliably returned to previous releases to keep on delivering new tech options? They’re at it again with PS5 Pro, and long may it continue!</p>

<p>We’ll start off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who turned in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">review of Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which wasn’t quite on the level of TT Games’ series, but certainly looks absolutely gorgeous. He’s joined that up with more Metaphor: Refantazio, and he’s been on a trip to play a mystery game. More on that soonish?</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing the curiously titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/">Max Mustard</a> on PSVR 2, which is surprisingly not a game about a hotdog stall that’s run out of ketchup. He’s also played Phasmophobia with his sister, and found that he really likes it now that he’s figured out more about how it works.</p>


<p>It’s been most Black Ops 6 for <strong>Jim</strong>, now that Season One is live, and he’s still having a great time with it. He’s also returned to New World: Aeternum and is approaching the endgame and PvP content that waits after level 60 &nbsp;– “It’s the most fun I’ve had playing a console MMO since Final Fantasy XIV and it’s good to see just how populated the world is, even if it means getting my ass handed to me in PvP zones.”</p>
<p>3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is, according to <strong>Aran</strong>, exactly what it sounds like. “It is a 3D revision of the original Don’t Die Mr Robot, and my full review should be out next week.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Steve</strong> has also played some 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot, as well as an early build of Soulframe (from the makers of Warframe), Steve reviewed “the effortlessly cool and sexy <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/sorry-were-closed-review/">Sorry, We’re Closed</a>, a game that takes the bones of a survival horror and reinvigorates them into something that feels fresh.”</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> apologised for playing Destiny 2, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> real world gaming adventure of Moving House went very well, but he now has the&nbsp;unpacking, painting, and sorting DLC to do. Maybe not quite in that order.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-pc-specs-revealed-ahead-of-february-release.1036809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian and Xbox have quietly revealed the&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>PC specs you'll need to run the upcoming first-person RPG, and they're relatively permissive, although it's likely you'll want a good rig to get the best out of this one.</p>

<p>The specs appeared yesterday on the game's Steam page without much fanfare from Obsidian itself, and since they're listed on Steam, you're only getting two presets: Minimum and Recommended, as is Steam's custom.</p>

<p>The minimum specs are pretty basic, but it's likely that you won't get much more than 30fps or so at 1080p resolution if you're running a rig with the minimum settings. Recommended users can likely expect a smoother experience, as usual.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-pc-specs-bear.jpg?itok=OB38gN88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-pc-specs-bear.jpg?itok=UgWldcl9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will need a decent PC to run it at Recommended specs.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>'s spec presets on Steam will need 16GB of RAM, Windows 10 or 11 with updates installed, and at least 75GB of file space, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-300gb" rel="nofollow">pretty reasonable</a> by modern game standards. You'll also want to install DirectX 12.</p>

<p>The game's Minimum settings will require either an Intel Core i5-8400 or an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. You'll also need an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, an AMD Radeon RX 5700, or an Intel Arc A580.</p>

<p>Moving up to Recommended, you'll need an Intel Core i7-10700K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor, as well as an Nvidia RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT card.</p>

<p>It's not clear what exactly those specs will get you; we don't have one of those tables developers sometimes release that show what kind of resolution and frame rate you can expect with each preset, so try to clear the Recommended settings by some distance if you want the smoothest experience.</p>

<p>Hopefully, it'll be better than the Xbox Series X|S version, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target" rel="nofollow">running at 30fps</a>. Console players can't simply upgrade their machines to help them run the game more smoothly, either.</p>




<p>These specs were revealed alongside&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>'s Premium Edition, which grants two skin packs, access to a digital artbook and soundtrack, and "up to 5 days early access". Let's hope it goes better than&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-early-access-bug" rel="nofollow"><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s early access period did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, it's a first-person RPG created by Obsidian, the makers of&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Appropriately enough, the game looks to be a mixture of those games, with the fantasy setting of the former (the very same one, in fact) and the first-person gameplay of the latter, albeit without guns.</p>

<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/avowed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th, although you can play it early if you pre-order the Premium Edition. The game is also launching on day one across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain Game Pass tiers</a>.</p>

Before that, you’ve got the critically demolished <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>, preceded by Uwe Boll’s monstrously dreadful <em>Far Cry</em> in 2008. (To be fair, <em>Prince of Persia</em> at least squeaked a profit, albeit not enough to prevent planned sequels getting cancelled.) Scattered amongst them are many promised projects that never quite seem to reach our eyes.<br></p><p>One of those is now known  to be <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678">was first confirmed as in development in 2012</a></span>. Set to star Tom Hardy (<em>Mad Max</em>) as ultra-spy Sam Fisher, be written by Eric Warren Singer (<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), and later attached to director Doug Liman (<em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>), it was announced at the same time as the Michael Fassbender-starring <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, although only one of them ever made it to screen.

<p>Grove Street Games’ lead has addressed the removal of their name from the credits of the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition. Fans pointed out that it was only partially removed.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/boss-of-developer-behind-gta-trilogys-original-poorly-received-launch-laments-being-removed-from-games-credits-even-though-he-wasnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Thomas Williamson, the head of Grove Street Games, recently <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">addressed</a> the removal of his company from the credits of the GTA Trilogy following the latest update. You can find his complete statement below.:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Speaking entire hypothetically: It’s a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players’ hands for years.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1857196839713263958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Several fans responded</a> to Williamson’s post, highlighting that Grove Street Games has not been entirely removed from the GTA Trilogy’s credits. They mentioned that the developers are still credited in the final credits but have been removed from the initial splash screen.</p>



<p>Recently, the GTA Trilogy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-receives-major-update-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a significant update for both PC and consoles</a>, introducing new game features and enhancements. Key highlights of this update include a new “Classic Lighting” mode and improved animations, which greatly enhance the visual quality of the games. <span>This update removed Grove Street Games from GTA Trilogy’s </span>opening credits. </p>

It’s available for the Assault, Vanguard, and Bulwark classes and is limited to Operations, Space Marine 2’s three-player co-op focused PvE mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s there that Space Marine 2 players are teaming up to form a three-pronged Neo-Volkite pistol death stream, rekindling memories of all those moments when the Ghostbusters use their iconic Proton Packs to trap ghosts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Neo-Volkite pistol is unique among Space Marine 2’s armory in that it blasts a heat ray onto enemies, dealing accumulative thermal damage. Focusing on one enemy ramps up the damage until it generates a localized explosion for huge damage to your target and all nearby enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have found that while the Neo-Volkite pistol is fun to use, it isn’t that effective especially on harder difficulties where ammo is scarce. At least, that’s the case in isolation. But what happens when all three players use the Neo-Volkite pistol to concentrate three heat rays onto the pesky Terminids? You get satisfying, Ghostbusters-style alien death, that’s what.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Crimsas demonstrated this in action, showing just how effective three Neo-Volkite pistols all trained on a single, powerful Termanid enemy (in this case a Carnifex) can be brought down to size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we now need is a mod that replaces the Neo-Volkite pistol model with an actual Proton Pack and we’ve got Ghostbusters 40k edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/109-patch-4-5-is-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Focus Entertainment has said</u></a> it’s limiting the Neo-Volkite pistol to Operations mode for now “as we continue to experiment with balancing in PvP.” It will be added to Eternal War mode in Space Marine 2’s next major update alongside a new Operations map, a new enemy, and the Dark Angels cosmetics. So, hopefully it won’t be long before even PvP is filled with a spot of Ghostbusters action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1grt0ik/neovolkite_my_beloved/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crimsas / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The patch added a number of visual features that were exclusive to the mobile versions, pleasing disgruntled fans of the groundbreaking open-world games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, a compilation of 2001’s Grand Theft Auto 3, 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and 2004’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, sparked a backlash upon its 2021 launch on PC and console. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review"><u>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to three classic games and their many legions of fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition was developed by Grove Street Games, which at the time came under fire for the poor quality of the release. The mobile versions were developed by Video Games Deluxe, the Australian studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/la-noire-the-vr-case-files"><u>L.A. Noire VR Case Files</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After this week’s update went live, users noticed Grove Street Games and its logo were removed from GTA Trilogy’s main menu and splash screen. Now, the PC and console versions align with the mobile versions, showing Rockstar as GTA’s developer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like mentions of Grove Street Games and their logos have been removed from the splash screen and main menu of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTA</a> Definitive Editions as well. <a href="https://t.co/ZmXpccyiyS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZmXpccyiyS</a></p>— TJGM (@TJGM_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TJGM_/status/1856316469954453783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this removal that Thomas Williamson, boss of Grove Street Games, has clearly reacted to in a thinly-veiled tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Speaking entire hypothetically: it's a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players' hands for years,” Williamson <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Williamson’s displeasure at recent events is clear, Grove Street Games and Williamson himself remain in GTA Trilogy’s end credits, as many X/Twitter users have pointed out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: Rumours being circulated by the community and even some news websites about Grove Street Games (GSG) having been removed from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTATrilogy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTATrilogy</a> entirely are unfounded. <br>Both GSG and Video Games Deluxe are in the final credits, only the initial splash screen was removed. <a href="https://t.co/MUkvgi2uZX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MUkvgi2uZX</a></p>— GTANet (@GTANet) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTANet/status/1857075030808461543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a messy end for GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which has endured controversy ever since it came out. Rockstar was forced to apologize for the state of the collection at launch and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-trilogy-free-game"><u>offered PC players free games</u></a> as recompense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the collection appeared to have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-remastered-trilogy-10-million-units-technical-issues"><u>sold very well despite the problems,</u></a> and Strauss Zelnick – CEO of Rockstar parent company Take-Two – eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-gta-trilogy-launch-problems-glitch-been-resolved"><u>called those issues a “glitch” that was “resolved.</u></a><u>”</u></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
