			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios has released Elder Scrolls Online Update 44 on PC and Mac (console users will have to wait until November 13). As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a>, this free update is highlighted by a major overhaul of the Battlegrounds, the game's version of instanced PvP.</p>
<p>If you've played the MMORPG before, you're probably aware that Battlegrounds was a 4v4v4 affair, mimicking the Alliance War between Daggerfall Covenant, Aldmeri Dominion, and Ebonheart Pact on a smaller scale. The three-way fight offered a lot of dynamic and unpredictable situations; however, Battlegrounds remained strictly a casual affair ever since their introduction back in 2017 with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind Chapter</a>. This is all changing with Update 44, which tweaks Battlegrounds to 4v4 and 8v8 formats with players split between two factions.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online developers have designed seven brand new PvP maps, of which four are available in the 8v8 format and three in the 4v4 format. The 8v8 Battlegrounds will feature the full breadth of modes (Capture the Relic, Team Death Match, Domination, Chaos Ball, and Crazy King) as well as power-ups scattered throughout the map to make things more hectic. The 4v4 Battlegrounds are limited to just Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Crazy King. However, they include exclusive features like Rounds, Lives, and Spectator Camera.</p>
<p>Round matches are best of three and last five minutes each round. Some matches have lives, and they are displayed in the top right corner of the player's HUD (Heads-Up Display). Lives are per person, not per team. If you run out of lives, you will not be able to respawn any longer in that match. The Spectator Camera will only work in matches where there are lives, and you can only watch members of your team who are still alive. Moreover, the 4v4 Battlegrounds also have a competitive leaderboard which is based on the medals earned in each match.</p>
<p>Both formats have added Tiebreakers to the scoring system. If a match ends with both teams tied, the match will be decided by medals won and remaining lives for tiebreakers. In the rare case of a 'true tie' on all other metrics, both teams will be considered not winning but also not losing for reward purposes. Lastly, the old 4v4v4 game mode will no longer be available in Elder Scrolls Online for queues, but it may return in the future for limited times during special mini-PvP events.</p>
<p>The oft-neglected Imperial City PvPvE zone has had some improvements in this patch, too. Imperial City keys and key fragments have been converted to Imperial Fragments, and vault treasure chests have become vendors. Furthermore, many of the area's existing vendors have enjoyed upgrades to their wares, including their quality and selection.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1ac957846eeb4ca1aef76999becc34a1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Update 44 also adds two new Companions to Elder Scrolls Online: the High Elf outcast Tanlorin and the Khajiit Necromancer Zerith-var, which come with unique passive abilities and questlines. These companions are available for free for ESO Plus members, while everyone else may purchase them with the in-game Crowns. ESO Plus members also get a 10% boost to PvP Alliance Points earned, PvP Skill Line ranks, Alliance rank, and Tel Var Stones gained from killing monsters. The patch also sees new Homes, new Furnishings, new Skill Styles, new Scripts, and a new Grimoire.</p>
<p>Last but not least, HDR is finally supported on PC (provided you have an HDR display) with extensive tweaking options: HDR Mode, HDR Peak Brightness, HDR Scene Brightness, HDR Scene Contrast, HDR UI Brightness, and HDR UI Contrast.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains Of Edith Finch</a> is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories, all devoted to the tragically short lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">a wonderful show of experimentation</a>, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While the project has yet to be formally announced, Giant Sparrow's founder and director Ian Dallas has shared a little about its wiggly inner workings with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/arts/giant-sparrow-next-game-edith-finch.html">New York Times</a>. There's also a smidgeon of info on <a href="https://www.giantsparrow.com/games/heron/">the developer's blog</a> - the URL suggests the project's working title is "Heron" - according to which Giant Sparrow are "drawing inspiration from places like Ico, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windosill">Windosill</a>, Spirited Away, and David Attenborough nature documentaries, along with the spirit of early animators like Winsor McCay and Walt Disney who used (for the time) cutting edge technology to build something that didn't feel technical at all but instead felt weirdly alive."
</p>
<p>
If the project takes inspiration from nature documentaries, it also takes inspiration from Dallas's disappointment about nature documentaries. He feels they're often rather broad and superficial, with too much cutting between creatures and places. "They work in part because it's like a distraction for a toddler," he told the NYT. Careful, Dallas, I hear David Attenborough's got a mean left hook for a guy his age. 
</p>
<p>
Giant Sparrow's designers have also found the nature documentary premise to be a bit of a glass ceiling, resulting in lukewarm concepts "like a photographing mini game, or like collecting 10 ladybugs or whatever." Hence, in part, the planned introduction of more fantastical creatures that might give rise to more complex approaches. Going by the concept artworks from the NYT piece, the menagerie currently ranges from regular chickens (complete with pooping functionality) to chickens that have gotten themselves confused with mobile homes. "When we started adding a few slightly goofy elements, that led us to some stranger and more interesting places," Dallas went on.

<p>
That said, part of the aim here is simply "to call out just how weird biology is" and encourage reflection on "how many bizarre things are going on around us all the time", rather than weaving a fairytale. 
</p>
<p>
They're also aiming for a more "exploratory and playful" world, with Dallas commenting that "single-player games often feel like a chess board - a world that's highly predictable and entirely designed to facilitate the limited set of actions a player is capable of." Here's a work-in-progress example of an in-game scenario: trying to coax a giraffe into coming over and lowering its head at the right angle, so that you can put something on it.
</p><p>
There's an element of horror, which has intensified as Giant Sparrow have investigated various creatures and realised just how bizarre, say, a butterfly's reproductive cycle is by the standards of stinky, non-holometabolous human beings. "What we have slowly found our way to is a game where animals feel gross and maybe you have this visceral reaction to, in the way that like, when a caterpillar walks over your finger there's something about all those legs moving that's really disturbing but also fascinating," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Long story short, Giant Sparrow's new game is a real blend of emotions, which is just how I like my emotions, personally. Going beyond the constraint of the nature documentary format, I'd love to know if the developers have thought about how their design expertise and experience may have structured their ideas about nonhuman creatures in advance.</p>
<p>I'm also interested to know whether the animals in the game are portrayed as passive, with the player making choices that progress the simulation, and whether there will be any interrogation of biology as a knowledge-making discipline. I have a lot of questions, yes.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, I definitely get a Jeff Vandermeer/New Weird vibe from all this. It sounds a bit like the up-market version of the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a>, in which you should definitely avoid getting too cosy with the giraffes. Incidentally, if your first thought on seeing the chicken house was "I want one", maybe check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reka">Reka</a>.

In 2025, they’re expanding further with <em>Final Fantasy,</em> featuring cards spread across all sixteen mainline franchise entries—initially teased in late summer of 2023. So far, we’ve seen Sephiroth, Lightning, and a Moogle. However, Square Enix producer Shoichi Ichikawa revealed we’d also see Cloud Strife and Noctis, along with a few summons, fan-favorite monsters, and iconic weapons.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1021272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released an official</a> update on the status of Marathon. The update came in the form of a nearly 10-minute long video on the game’s official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>In the video, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Ziegler</a> gives an update on what’s been worked on since the last update on Marathon. He covers the direction of the game as well as plans for future updates about the game.</p>



<p>The update also doesn’t include any look at official gameplay, but does come with some concept art for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/">few of the game’s heroes</a>. If you want to watch the video for yourself, you can below.</p>



<p>As far as what was covered, Ziegler discusses the game being an extraction shooter, including diving into to what an extraction shooter is for those who may be unfamiliar with the subgenre. Ziegler also talks about taking elements from the original Marathon and expanding them for a new game with a modern audience. </p>



<p>“We’re taking a lot of familiar elements, especially a lot of the mysterious and kind of eeriness and the — how do I put it —  the psychological kind of the entire IP as it exists before,” he said. </p>



<p>“But we’re layering on some elements that we think really help modernize it, and also bring it to a new story and new world that we can sort of continue to update and delight all of you with over the course of time.”</p>



<p>Regarding how the game’s been changing during development and where things currently stand, Ziegler says that changes to the game have been “aggressive” for the past couple years along with holding multiple playtests.</p>



<p>“We’ve been testing with a lot of players,” he said. “A lot of players like yourself, also with creators. It’s sort of insanely awesome and I’m filled with gratitude when I think about it because there’s so many people who contributed by telling us, ‘Hey, this thing sucks’ or ‘This thing’s great’.”</p>



<p>He then added that there are a number of things within the game that are at different states of development. Things like the game’s environments are in a more complete state while the character models continue to be iterated through.  Marathon’s enemy models, he said, are “still kind of a little bit in an early state.”</p>



<p>Back to the characters, Ziegler gave a sneak peak at a couple of the characters in development: a runner codenamed Thief and one codenamed Stealth..</p>



<p>Ziegler then wrapped up the video stating that more content reveals are coming in 2025 for Marathon. Also coming in 2025 will be an expansion of Bungie’s playtests for Marathon to include more players. There was no hint as to when that would happen, however.</p>



<p>As far as an official release date update, that information wasn’t provided.</p>



<p>What do you think of the development update for Marathon from Bungie? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a given at this point; an expectation that we all foster when a new Call of Duty title launches. It’s axiomatic: within a matter of days following the release of a new game, there <strong>will be </strong>a 24/7 playlist. On November 1, Nuketown lands in Black Ops 6 – and dataminers have found that when it does, a 24/7 playlist for the map will go live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-written-in-the-stars">Written in the Stars</h2>



<p>On Twitter, ‘SemtexLeaks’ uncovered a reference to a Nuketown 24/7 playlist in Black Ops 6, which will assumedly arrive when the map is added to the public pool on November 1. That means that players far and wide will be spending hours grinding the iconic, small-form map – just as our Call of Duty masters intended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This year’s Nuketown is a ‘reimagining’ of the original map that surfaced in 2010, and by all accounts, it looks fantastic while at the same time retaining the familiar feel of the decade-and-a-bit-old environment that has re-appeared in every Black Ops game.</p>



<p>From the code uncovered in the game’s files, Nuketown 24/7 will feature a rotation of Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Order. Except for Kill Order, which is new for Black Ops 6, this is a fairly standard rotation that players have come to expect from Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>Most of the maps in Black Ops 6 have proven to be troublesome for one reason or another, so perhaps the familiarity of Nuketown will give some players a feeling of comfort after this first week of struggling.</p>



<p>Will you be jumping into Nuketown 24/7 when it drops on November 1? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/conclave-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On a whim over the weekend, I went to see <em>Conclave</em>, a Ralph Fiennes movie about choosing a new Pope. I wish I’d watched it at home.</p><p><em>Conclave</em>, based on a 2016 book, starts with the Pope being dead, and Fiennes’ character Cardinal Lawrence in charge of running the show of picking a new one. This is not a straightforward process; through the course of the conclave, cardinals politick and backstab, secrets are revealed, and characters wrestle with their responsibility to shape the future of the Catholic Church and their own ambitions. There’s no way to explain my experience without talking about the end of the movie, which only came out last week. So I feel obligated to add a <strong>spoiler warning</strong>, even though doing so is exactly the thing I want to write about. So there you go; read on below to find out why I hate myself for this choice.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CONCLAVE - Official Trailer 2 [HD] - Only In Theaters October 25" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t915aZmyEBg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A small handful of papal candidates emerges through the film. I was rooting for the liberal-minded Bellini, played by Stanley Tucci, but it’s clear from the beginning that he doesn’t have the votes. Middle-of-the-road candidates get cut from the running as their past misdeeds or bad behavior regarding the conclave get revealed, and a lot of the drama of the film comes from a quietly intense Fiennes wrestling with his duty to the papacy and how he has to participate in the sneaking and backstabbing in pursuit of that duty. At the end, the two most viable candidates are the frighteningly conservative Cardinal Tedesco and the mysterious Cardinal Benitez, whom the Pope secretly made Cardinal of Kabul following his ministries in the Congo and Iraq. World events outside the conclave put Tedesco and Benitez in stark opposition and make the choice feel much bigger than just who the next Pope will be.</p><p>In the end, Benitez gets the most votes. But before he can be announced, Lawrence puts together the remaining pieces of his past. The Pope had paid for Benitez to go to a clinic in Geneva, and we find out in the movie’s penultimate scene that this was because Benitez learned in adulthood that he’s intersex, and the clinic visit was to get his uterus and ovaries removed. But Benitez ultimately didn’t get the surgery; he tells Lawrence “I am what God made me” and explains that he thought it would be sinful to alter God’s design. Lawrence says nothing about the conversation, and the movie ends with Benitez presumably becoming Pope.</p><p>As a trans man who is religious, I found Benitez’s position a very moving take on the usual line regarding gender-related surgeries from some corners of religion, and I loved the radical idea of a non-cis Pope. I gasped in delight when Benitez explained his situation. But the other people in my theater–on a Saturday afternoon, primarily elderly couples–didn’t have the same reaction: The majority of them laughed. Maybe it was because they saw the reveal itself as comical, or as a sign that for all Lawrence’s efforts to do the right thing he had picked the wrong Pope anyway, or just because the movie had one last secret up its sleeve. But their reaction was a shitty thing to experience, and as the lights came up, I rushed from the theater, not wanting to overhear anyone discussing the ending.</p><p>Director Edward Berger told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/conclave-movie-ending-spoilers-edward-berger-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> that he didn’t intend the end to be a shock, saying&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We didn’t want to play it for shock value, by the way. We really wanted it to feel very natural and soft. This is Benitez. This is who he is; this is part of him. We wanted it to play as subtly and as sensitively as possible, and really not go for the big twist, sensational reveal.</p><p>…I do feel that we try to deal with [the reveal] with diligence, sensitivity, and not using it as a plot device or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It’s hard for me to buy this. Characters’ trans identities coming to light has a <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-the-last-of-us-part-2s-tran-1844245756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long history</a> of being played for drama, which Berger cannot excuse himself from simply by saying that’s not what he meant to do. Though every character in the film has secrets, by coming at the very end Benitez’s naturally gets more dramatic weight. As such, it inevitably gets painted as the movie’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=conclave+ending&amp;sca_esv=db7f7e8d65832db1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJenApzwn0I1Mlr375PiuruhFDN3g%3A1730054385826&amp;ei=8YgeZ4OOMuas5NoP3qDg-Q8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDyu_omq-JAxVmFlkFHV4QOP8Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=conclave+ending&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiD2NvbmNsYXZlIGVuZGluZzILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEyCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBMgQQABgDMgsQABiABBixAxiDATIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjILEAAYgAQYhgMYigUyCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBUjjEFDuAVilDHABeAGQAQCYAUqgAdkFqgECMTG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgygAoUGwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICChAjGIAEGCcYigXCAgUQABiABMICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICERAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGMkDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYkgMYigXCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICCBAAGBYYHhgPmAMAiAYBkAYFkgcCMTKgB_ZU&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest twist</a> in coverage. Placing it at the end also means anyone writing about it–myself included–has to talk around it as a spoiler, which fits it into a long-standing trope of non-cis people’s genders being played as a <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1278714964816076800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise</a>. All of this is surely what made my theater erupt in laughter, whether Berger intended that reaction or not.</p><p>In fairness to Berger, the moment is indeed played with subtlety, with both Fiennes and Carlos Diehz as Benitez tackling it with the same tenor as the rest of <em>Conclave</em>’s secrets. Everyone’s pasts raise questions about whether they are the right choice for Pope, as well as questions about what the “right” choice even means; while Benitez’s identity would be disqualifying based on the traditions of the Church, both it and his politics fit into the bigger questions about the future direction of the Church that <em>Conclave</em> highlights through its various papal candidates. <em>Conclave</em> features an understated subplot about <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vatican-womens-magazine-women-church-world-editors-quit-climate-distrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuns</a>, which when combined with Benitez’s character, suggests gender issues in the Church are one theme the movie wants to explore, and one that fits within the movie’s bigger themes about progress versus tradition. If Lawrence had discovered the reason behind Benitez’s cancelled trip to Geneva sooner, if it had been just one more piece of information he had to wrestle with, gender might have taken center stage as the movie's defining issue. That’s a movie I, personally, would have seen, but it also would have made <em>Conclave</em> a movie about a different topic than it is. It also, let’s be honest, would have turned it into a movie that was unlikely to have drawn the audience full of elderly Brooklynites I saw it with.&nbsp;</p><p>A search headline from Slate highlights this: on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slate+conclave&amp;oq=slate+conclave&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRifBTIHCAUQIRifBTIHCAYQIRifBTIHCAcQIRifBTIHCAgQIRifBTIHCAkQIRifBdIBCDIzNjRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>, the hed reads “It Seemed Like This Year’s Safest Oscar Pick–Until It Revealed One Final Surprise.” On the <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/10/conclave-movie-ending-explained-benitez-oscars-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">page</a>, that Slate hed reads “Is <em>Conclave</em>’s Twist Ending Honorable, Offensive, Or Just Plain Ridiculous?,” and the article itself digs into <em>Conclave</em>’s choice not to use the Church’s prevalent sex scandals as its primary topic, as well as whether Benitez’s election does justice to questions about gender in the Church. Writer Dana Stevens says of her viewing experience that “The climactic reveal did provoke some scattered laughs, but those struck me as guffaws of surprise, not derision. Translated into a verbal response, that laughter might have meant something like 'You got me, Berger—whatever I was expecting, it was not <em>that</em>.'”</p><p>I appreciate this interpretation, but it still can’t avoid casting Benitez’s identity as a “gotcha.” Berger can’t control the response of the audience, and was working with the source material of the book (which I haven’t read). But I think it’s naive of him to believe the ending would play the way he says he intended it, instead of how it played out in my theater experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I would be more likely to agree with Berger’s explanation of his intentions for that moment if I’d watched <em>Conclave</em> at home, where my reaction to the ending would have been the only one. Instead, I feel like I spent $16 to be surrounded by a bunch of people laughing at a character who wasn’t cis. And now, reading about the movie, I’m inundated with sensationalist headlines about twists and surprises like I’ve read about so many movies featuring trans characters. I tried to avoid the same choice in my own headline, but I also worry I'm playing into the same problem by writing about <em>Conclave</em> and its ending at all.</p><p>All this aside, <em>Conclave</em> was a fine semi-thriller, and I can appreciate what Berger was trying to do. At the end of the day the film probably has more to say about <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/conclave-director-edward-berger-interview-the-power-of-self-doubt-long-road-to-the-a-list-those-pesky-rumors-he-will-revive-007-1236081714/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electoral politics</a> than gender. I wish seeing it had been nothing more than a way to spend some time on a Saturday.  &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">beans racing</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">penguins racing</a>, but we have not yet seen cats racing. That is because cats will not stoop to such frivolities, where it can be reasonably avoided. Cats are too self-respecting to get caught up in silly online multiplayer party games. Please. Don't insult their intelligence, their divinity, their mastery of the environment and of your emotions. Cats don't need 2-9 player scrambles across the rooms of an eccentric manor house, with customisable outfits and various minigames. What? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumping-jazz-cats">Jumping Jazz Cats</a>? No. I won't recognise it. This is a work of impossible sedition. Impossible, cute sedition. Pay no attention to the trailer below.</p>

<p>Jumping Jazz Cats describes itself as "pussycat parkour", skillfully avoiding a far naughtier way of wording the same idea. Well done, Team 17 copywriter. I would not have been able to resist.</p>
<p>"These amical mini-games are played in teams," says the game's blurb, "and include rip-roaring races, fat cat collectathons and epic showdowns between shadow cats and mighty lions."</p>
<p>It's basically a party game about sliding down rails, scratching up furniture, bounding from table jelly, and clambering up bookcases in a fright. As the owner of a cat I can only say: correct. If anything, it is not chaotic enough. There's local multiplayer for 4 people, and you can unlock certain collar tags that will buff your cat in as-yet-unexplained ways. </p><p>Jazz music also appears to be a big theme, with some minigames sporting rhythm game prompts, and other levels featuring big dreamlike musical instruments stretching across the rooms. My favourite jazz musician cat remains fellow Irish stray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRET1vsfiJM">Thomas O'Malley</a> from The Aristocats, aka Baloo but small and ginger.</p>
<p>You know, we have a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cats-in-games">the best cats in games</a>. But that was sadly written before the release of both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-kitty-big-city">Little Kitty Big City</a> (<em>Pipclosure: former RPS writer Pip Warr worked on the latter</em>). Do we need to update that listicle? I don't know. What would a cat do? </p>
<p>Yes, you're right. They'd climb the curtains, shred the sofa, and then go to sleep. The list update can wait. Just like anyone waiting for Jumping Jazz Cats, which has aloofly set its release date as "coming soon". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But bear with me. First off, it’s one of the best <em>Call of Duty</em> storylines in recent memory, but it’s also an excellent introduction to the gameplay and mechanics you’ll encounter in multiplayer. It’s similar to the Training Course, providing you with a foundation.</p><p>While the AI may not pose a significant challenge, especially on normal difficulty or lower, they will allow you to test out your aim, learn cover mechanics, time your abilities, and memorize hotkeys for gadgets and equipment, all of which transfer over to multiplayer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-recommend-id="image://8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-recommend-id="image://8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you load into the <em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer, sure, you can jump straight into the core playlist and dive into Team Deathmatch or Hardpoint.

You can and should work your way through:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Basic Movement</li><li>Essential Equipment</li><li>Omnimovement Basics</li><li>180-degree Combat Dive Drill</li><li>Combat Supine Drill</li><li>Combat Slide &amp; Dive Drill</li><li>Body Shield Drill</li></ol><p>These all prove valuable in competitive multiplayer, but especially the Omnimovement basics and combat drill mechanics.

Everyone feels faster, more fluid, than you. But they’re not. They’re using the same control schemes and hotkeys as you, but more effectively.</p><p>The best way to learn Omnimovement, aside from spending considerable time in the Training Course, is to throw yourself into the fray. Load into the core playlist, ideally Team Deathmatch, Domination, or Hardpoint—a team-oriented game mode—and practice. You’ll likely lose, and you may wind up suffering text or voice abuse from your teammates—this is <em>Call of Duty</em> after all—but you’ll find that after a few rounds of leaping around like a fool, you’re beginning to gain ground with Omnimovement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you ask anyone online, especially on social media, they’re going to tell you to stick with the meta—the best weapons in the game that everyone uses.

But they’re only a small part of the game.</p><p>Personally, I almost always use the AK-74. I like its crosshairs, powerful feel, and its sound design. Do those aspects make for a meta weapon? No, but I still frequently place in the top three on my team. The point is, find a weapon that you enjoy using, then practice with it.

Choose your loadout and enter quantum unstable zones rich with active matter—the most valuable and the most dangerous resource in all multiverse. Fight against rivals from other timelines, survive physics-breaking anomalies and try to stay alive. Harvest active matter, gather loot and extract to a safe place before the whole zone ceases to exist with everything inside it.</p><p>Active matter changes things and bends space and time, so you might encounter operatives and other survivors that lost their mind and humanity after exposure to this substance. Other players, though, would always be your most dangerous enemy. Expand your syndicate base, upgrade your arsenal and participate in fierce battles between syndicates over the key sources of active matter, as they’re your only chance to break out of the loop and gain control over your destiny.</p></blockquote><!-- zp_shiv error: no images in gallery! --><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Player-Versus-Player-Versus-Environment Extraction-Style Raids</strong> – Players go solo or in small squads inside the quantum unstable zones in their quest for active matter and other loot. Active matter can be harvested by killing AM-transformed creatures, taken away from other players or picked up directly from active matter clusters. Join this never ending hunt to improve your chances to find the way out of the time loop.</li><li><strong>Realistic Weapons and Gear</strong> – Active matter randomly brings things from other timelines to the quantum unstable zones and allows you to replicate a specific item from other timelines in the safety of your base. Despite the mysterious origin of your weapons, your arsenal is always rooted in real-world military technologies and tactics, as war seems to be the only constant in this chaotic multiverse.</li><li><strong>Gameplay-Influencing Active Matter Effects</strong> – Mind-bending anomalies that change gravitational force and space topology right in front of your eyes. Thrilling encounters with eerie SCP-inspired objects would send shivers down your spine, and creatures transformed by active matter would attack you on sight.</li><li><strong>Intense Player-Versus-Player Battles</strong> – Syndicates of operatives fight over control of a passive source of active matter, using all the weapons and other gear they can bring into battle or craft on site. Join player-versus-player battles you like and make a real impact on the fate of the multiverse!</li><li><strong>Fascinating Maps</strong> – Battles take place at locations that exist outside of space and time boundaries. Active Matter features a variety of maps, including a huge island with rusty Soviet industrial complexes and cryptic science labs that were among the first to study this new phenomena. Explore these places to find hints on the origin of active matter.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Starting with all new passes added after the current season ends, you will progress through any pass you have using XP--Festival points and Lego studs will be retired, and you'll be able to progress all of your current passes simultaneously by earning XP in any mode. This change will start with the new Festival pass--which is being re-dubbed as the "Music pass"-- that launches on Nov. 2, and the Lego Pass will be updated with this change on Dec. 1, when Fortnite Chapter 6 begins.</p><p>On top of the changes to progression, the passes themselves will be changing too. The current Festival and Lego passes, as well as the mini-pass events like this summer's Pirates of the Caribbean one, have all used the same 11-tier template that's split into free and paid tracks. New passes that start after Chapter 6 begins in December will finally abandon that template, switching to a new single track that will have both paid and free items. Likewise, the battle pass is being simplified, doing away with the battle star currency and swapping in a more straightforward progression system.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391549" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391549"></a><figcaption>Fortnite Festival will soon move on from this pass format.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg"></figure><p>In essence, the battle passes, Lego passes, and Music passes will now all have a similar format, though the Lego and Music passes will likely still be much shorter than the battle passes.</p><p>On top of all that, starting in Chapter 6, Fortnite will no longer have an option for buying levels on its passes--instead, you'll be able to buy any specific item directly, though you'll still need to buy the pass itself first. In theory, this means you could be able to show up at the end of the season and purchase the tier 100 skin immediately without having to buy out the whole pass for $100+.</p><p>The passes will still go away at their stated end dates, and you won't be able to purchase or progress them after their respective season ends.</p><p>This could be considered a quality of life boost, since it will mean that you don't need to play Festival at all to complete the pass for that mode. But these changes will likely be accompanied by the removal or severe nerfing of passive XP from Festival and Lego Fortnite--because the quests for those modes will now award XP instead of a mode-specific currency, the passive XP becomes unnecessary. Since a lot of folks used these modes to level up while AFK, it's possible that this change is being made at least in part to eliminate that practice.</p><p>That passive rate of XP gain in these modes has been quite good, but overall progression may be slower once these changes kick in. We'll have to see how it actually works before we know if this is a positive change.</p>

<p>Are you excited about Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship? The relatively new tournament series has become increasingly popular among Valorant fans. The co-ed series features both women and male players from various esports organizations. Here is the upcoming VCT Game Changers Championship format being used.</p>



<h2 id="h-berlin-s-vct-game-changers-championship-format">Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship Format</h2>



<p>The popular event will feature some of the best Valorant players in the world facing off against each other in Berlin. However, no official prize pool has been announced.</p>



<p>Still, fans are gearing up for a legendary event to see who takes home the 2024 Game Changers Championship title.</p>



<p>So, what about the format? Well, Riot Games just released the tournament format today on Twitter, let’s break it down:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10 Teams Competing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Double-Elimination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best-of-3 Brackets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Top Seeds From NA and EMEA Will Get a Buy Into 2nd Round</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Matches: Best-of-5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The series will feature competitors from the following regions of the world:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong></li>



<li><strong>Latin America</strong></li>



<li><strong>EMEA</strong></li>



<li><strong>China</strong></li>



<li><strong>APAC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brazil</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Grand Finals will be streamed live on the <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1850930070640324947">official Valorant Twitch.</a></p>

<p>Here are the official VCT Game Changers Championship dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 8 – 17, 2024.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament series is meant to give Valorant fans and competitors the gaming action they need during the official VCT off-season. The actual VCT season ended in South Korea back in August of 2024 when EDward Gaming was awarded first place.</p>



<p>Luckily, Valorant understands that waiting until 2025 for more competitive Valorant action will not go over well with fans and players. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review.1021203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a long time since I've played a game that stuck with me in the way that 2015’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/life-is-strange-series-review">Life is Strange</a> has. Its ability to tell a unique coming-of-age story about a rebellious but often shy teen without coming off preachy or overstaying its welcome was refreshing and had me thinking about it long after I discovered everything I could within the confines of Arcadia Bay. While the series has had a few sequels, prequels, and side stories since, none of them seemed to recapture the magic of those first five episodes for me – until now. Life is Strange: Double Exposure not only lives up to the sky-high standard set by the original but also manages to take it in a fresh new direction and improve on nearly every aspect from the previous games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was great to revisit Max Caulfield 10 years after the events of Life is Strange. Even though Max is well into her 20s now, she's still very much the same character she was the last time we saw her: She’ll overanalyze her surroundings, make awkward jokes to herself, and, most importantly, take way too many pictures. But with her transition to adulthood comes a whole new set of issues she needs to deal with. Instead of worrying about fitting in and trying to impress everyone she met in Blackwell Academy, she’s now a grad student and has to act as an authority figure herself. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Double Exposure Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are moments where she's clearly coming to terms with the fact that she’s no longer young, such as when she questions some of the cringeworthy things she said in the original game or reminisces about when she was an undergrad and had to cram in as much studying and caffeine as possible before finals. It was the little moments like this that stuck with me and really helped make this new chapter in Max’s story even more relatable.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Writing on The Walls</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect in a Life is Strange game, you'll need to make some tough decisions. Even though there are only a handful of major choices in each of the five chapters and not all of them will dramatically affect the overall outcome, they do all have consequences because characters will remember how you treat them and act accordingly – to a degree that previous games never managed to nail down. This time, conversations felt like I was talking to an actual person instead of playing a game of guessing the correct answer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in the first chapter, you are able to ask Amanda, the bartender of a local joint called The Snapping Turtle, out on a date if you play your cards right. On my first playthrough, I did everything I would need to in order to kickstart a romantic relationship with her by learning a handful of awful pick-up lines from other bar patrons. But on my second run, I opted not to ask her out and instead just became friends. While this didn't necessarily change anything major with the story moving forward, I appreciated that there was a stark difference in how Amanda treated Max if they were dating or were just friends. In addition to romancing people, you can be mean, flirty, or even flat-out ignore someone if you want to. Without diving too heavily into spoiler territory, this is one of the few choose-your-own-adventure-style games I’ve played where I didn't stress about making the “wrong decision” because every outcome felt natural and worth exploring rather than some being a consolation prize. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Exposure’s chapters each take around two or three hours to complete, which makes them shorter than those in some of the other Life is Strange games. This is actually a good thing, though, because I never felt like I was wasting my time dealing with a filler act or meandering around a party just to pad out the runtime. While there are a few plot points that don't really seem to go anywhere unless you dig through Max’s phone, I never felt like I was missing out on anything too important to the overall story just because I neglected to keep up with my backlog of text messages and social media posts. I like a good epic-scale RPG, too, but the fact that Double Exposure respected my time and told a story that’s tight and concise was refreshing.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That story deals with a number of seriously heavy topics. Everything from divorce to anxiety to the different ways we grieve over the loss of a loved one is covered here in a way that's so expertly written I never felt like any of these subjects were diminished or sensationalized – they just felt real. It would have been easy for Double Exposure to touch on a sensitive topic and then resolve it with a “thing bad” or “thing good” decision at the end, but instead the writing offers nuanced and appropriate approaches to its situations, many of which I’ve had to deal with in my own life. Seeing a video game character struggle to handle something like the anger and frustration one might feel after someone close to them takes their own life was an unexpected and especially well-executed bit of writing.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What really sells the writing is the incredible performances and animations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It works so well in part because every character in Double Exposure has their own backstory and is written to feel like an actual human being, faults and all. For example, Reggie, a student at the school where Max teaches, will overshare at times because he sees Max as an authority figure, while Gwen, another teacher at Caledon Univeristy, keeps private details to herself because, like in real life, not everyone immediately tells everybody they meet everything about themselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What really sells Double Exposure’s writing and story is its absolutely incredible performances and character animations. While this has always been a highlight of the series, this game has more moments where characters would tell me everything they needed to say without speaking a word thanks to their subtle facial expressions. Say something mean and a character may look at you with disgust for a moment before responding. Pull somebody away from a group and you'll see other characters briefly look disappointed that you interrupted them. While this isn't anything new in games, the way in which Double Exposure emphasizes these little touches made me actually care about my actions and how I treated people. Thanks to this attention to detail and directing, Double Exposure’s character interactions are easily the most believable and well-executed I've seen in a Life is Strange game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Reinventing Your Exit</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Without getting too heavy into spoiler territory here, Double Exposure’s mystery is one full of twists and turns that definitely kept me guessing until I reached the finale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to give Max different powers was the correct choice because her original time manipulation abilities just wouldn't have worked within the story being told here. If she could rewind time with the turn of her palm then the entire mystery could have been solved in a few moments, and that's just no fun. Instead, those powers have been replaced by a set of interdimensional travel abilities that fit this new tale perfectly. As its title suggests, Max is able to view and travel between two separate realities: one that's vibrant, warm, and full of life, complete with Christmas decorations and a more upbeat soundtrack, and another that's miserable, cold, and marked by death. These realities exist in tandem with each other and are, in many ways, polar opposites. Everything from flyers on the walls of the school halls to the music and even how people interact with Max can be wildly different between the dead and living worlds. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I never found myself getting frustrated or lost on a puzzle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzles this time around greatly benefit from Max’s abilities, too. I never found myself getting frustrated or lost, and I’m happy to say there were never any sections where I had to dodge a train or perform any sort of frustrating quick time events. Her new abilities instead allow for a slower-pace where I needed to use deductive reasoning and explore both realities in order to find a clue or spy on somebody. Need to find something for someone in the living world? It's probably nearby in the dead world. Need to sneak around an active murder investigation in the dead world? Just hop over to the living world and walk past where the guards are standing, then hop back. It’s not wildly complex stuff, but the way Double Exposure utilizes Max’s powers not only to help you find clues and explore but also to show how the world around you evolves in two separate paths at the same time makes this one of the more interesting uses of a multiverse in gaming.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Exposure's smart use of reality hopping also helps with the story in ways that no other power in Life is Strange has before. For example, someone could be dealing with some trouble in one world that informs how you interact with them in the other. Meanwhile, The Snapping Turtle in the living world is warm, people are conversing with each other, and the music is upbeat and welcoming, but its dead world version has aggressive music, there are fewer people around, and the lighting is cold and uninviting. Because I was able to explore freely and instantly see the differences between both realities, I found myself learning about the worlds, their characters, and the results of my actions in a more meaningful way rather than just searching for exposition dumps and waiting for text messages. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nick's Tough Choices Playlist</h3><p>These are all games that require you to make tough choices.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Caledon University itself is an idealistic-looking Northeastern college campus. The buildings are old and covered in a layer of snow and student art, and the cinematography when you take a moment to reflect on a park bench or overlook shows off how beautiful this location is. Unfortunately, it's also a bit smaller than the areas from the other Life is Strange Games, and while it would have been nice to explore a larger world outside of the few accessible locations on campus, Max’s house, and The Snapping Turtle, every area in Double Exposure is pretty densely packed with things to interact with and explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are also bolstered by composer Tessa Rose Jackson with some of the best original music I've heard in a video game all year. The soundtrack not only perfectly captures the emotions of each scene but also helps to amplify the tone of the world, making it feel even more alive or dead, depending on which reality you're in. The same can be said about the color grading and cinematography. The series is known for its cinematic look, and Double Exposure is no exception thanks to its rich color palette and smart camera work. Vista shots, snap zooms, and following focus on characters are all artfully executed in a way that would feel at home in a feature film. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The US Copyright Office has confirmed it will not grant video game preservationists exceptions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">statement</a>, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) said that for the last three years, it had been supporting the Software Preservation Network (SPN) in a petition to "allow libraries and archives to remotely share digital access to out-of-print video games in their collections".</p>
<p>However, despite the Copyright Office’s <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">decision</a> to prevent licensed game archivists, the VGHF said it had "no regrets about going through this process".</p>

<p>"Over the last three years, working on the petition has helped us generate important research, notably our Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States report, which proved that around 87 percent of video games released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print," the organisation said.</p>
<p>"Our combined efforts with SPN have raised significant public awareness of these issues and have already made an impact throughout the game industry and preservation communities."</p>
<p>The statement went on to say that the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) "declared that [it] would never support remote game access for research purposes under any conditions", and the game industry's "absolutist position", forces researchers to explore "extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable".</p>
<p>"We're not done fighting here," the VGHF concluded. "We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues.</p>
<p>"We encourage members of the game industry who are disappointed by the Copyright Office’s decision to ask their leadership to push for greater support for the work of libraries and archives within their industry groups."</p>

			<p>Even when it was released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was never a powerhouse hardware, but with some overclocking, the system is capable of achieving impressive scores in some benchmark tests and even running the Dolphin GameCube emulator reasonably well.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> conducted another extreme overclocking test on L4T Ubuntu, effectively putting the Tegra X1 chip on steroids. This made the system achieve some impressive scores in tests such as Membench, Cuda95, and Geekbench 6. The fully overclocked system also runs the Dolphin GameCube/Wii emulator surprisingly well, achieving more than playable framerates at 1080p resolution in Mario Kart Wii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Extreme OC Benchmark on L4T Ubuntu - (Geekbench/glmark2/Dolphin)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRogKHSt5ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the past few months, we got a glimpse of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of doing with overclocking, thanks to a few other tests. One of them proved how an overclocked system modded with<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/"> 8GB of RAM</a> is capable of running<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-above-60-fps/"> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at above 60 FPS at native resolution and even at 30 FPS at 1440p</a>. If the rumors circulating online are correct, the console's successor shouldn't have much trouble running current games with good performance and great image quality, at least in its first few years of availability, thanks to 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which should allow developers to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S</a>, and NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes treated the audience to a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-182-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double Devstream</a> for Warframe and Soulframe, and those interested heard a lot of big news about the titles. The streams provided a lot of information about the franchise and started with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/">huge reveal</a> of Warframe: 1999, being released in December. A 1999 prequel webcomic will be released in November to get fans excited for the upcoming release. Additionally, Xaku Prime Access will begin on November 13.</p>
<p>Xaku is an amalgamation of three forgotten Warframes and is now converging once again. They previously acted as beneficiaries of the Entrati family and were lost to the void. Now they are emerging as Xaku Prime, and two new Prime weapons will also be released alongside them. A Syandana and Operator suit will also be released along with Xaku on November 13.</p>
<p>The comic has been produced in partnership with community artist Karu, and explores the founding of the Hex Syndicate. Additionally, there will be a playable mini-game in the Hollvanian Mall hub, where you can experience a "90s era run n' gun side-scroller," which was developed with Sumo Digital. You'll also be able to customize the Atomicycle with multiple color schemes and 11 upcoming premium skins to make your mode of transport flashy and exciting on the streets of Hollvania.</p>
<p>Trinity and Nyx will be receiving light reworks to make their gameplay experience more enjoyable, with Trinity's passive ability being replaced with other buffs to her other abilities to help make her meta-viable. This comes ahead of their Protoframe appearance in Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The team behind Soulframe provided an update, stating that the Preludes testing access will open up widely in 2025, which will give players a look into the pre-Alpha state of the game. The Devstream also provided new insight into the game, stating that the Preludes invites are continuing to be sent out, with the team continuing to provide access to players. Each player that gets invited to the playtest will get four additional codes that they can share with friends and family so that they don't have to experience the game on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, additional changes to the combat system was mentioned, as well as the ability to acquire skills via weapon usage, changes to player progression, crafting and visual upgrades to the environments that players will get to explore.</p>
<p>During this devstream, they also honored one of the most prominent figures in the Warframe development team, Mike 'Mynki' Brennan. He was the first Art Director for Warframe, and helped provide great designs to the franchise and made Warframe the iconic IP that it is today. You can read his <a href="https://www.digitalextremes.com/news/remembering-mike-mynki-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full obituary</a> on the Digital Extremes website, where they dedicate Warframe: 1999 to him.</p>

<p>Quickscoping is an incredibly popular playstyle in Call of Duty, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> players are already testing out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snipers</a> to see which gun provides the fast ADS speeds and one-shot capabilities. </p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best quickscoping Sniper loadout in Black Ops 6, look no further, as we have all the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you’ll need to build an accurate and fast one-shot class setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-quickscoping-sniper-in-black-ops-6">Best quickscoping Sniper in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-lw3a1-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LW3A1 Frostline</a> is the best Sniper for quickscoping in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> due to its fast mobility and handling. It’s a bolt-action Sniper  Rifle, so it requires an accurate shot, which is extremely satisfying when it hits. It will one-shot enemies to the head, upper chest, and upper arms, so you’ll need to retain accuracy while quickscoping in order to drop enemies quickly.</p>



<p>The SVD may have better handling and mobility, however, it’s a semi-auto rifle, which means it lacks one-shot capabilities, making it a worse option.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-frostline-better-than-the-lr-7-62">Is the LW3A1 Frostline better than the LR 7.62?</h3>



<p>The LW3A1 is better for quickscoping, but the LR 7.62 is the best Sniper in terms of damage and one-shot kill consistency. </p>



<p>The LR 7.62 will drop an enemy in one bullet so long as you hit the arms, chest, or head. The Frostline is less forgiving, as you need to hit the upper chest and arms to secure a one-shot kill. That said, the LR 7.62 is slower and has worse handling, so as far as quickscoping goes, I prefer the fast and weightless feel of the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-attachments-for-quickscoping-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments for quickscoping in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Comb: </strong>Commando Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser: </strong>Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 7.62 Nato FMJ</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Short Barrel </strong>provides a boost to the jumping aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, which I found incredibly useful with Ominimovement in Black Ops 6, as you’ll often find yourself jumping around to avoid bullets and hit shots.</p>



<p>To increase aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, the <strong>Commando Riser </strong>Comb is a great choice, while the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> provides some flinch resistance and aim walking movement speed.</p>



<p>Arguably the most important attachment for quickscoping in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Target Laser</strong>, which drastically reduces aiming idle sway and improves your aim walking steadiness. This means that when you aim in, your aim will be more accurate to where your crosshairs were before aiming down sight, leading to more accurate quickscopes.</p>



<p>Lastly, to add some flair to your shots, the <strong>7.62 Nato FMJ </strong>Fire Mod will allow you to hit wallbangs with an improvement to penetration damage.</p>

<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Cold Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> Overkill</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best quickscoping loadout in Black Ops 6, you’ll want <strong>Ghost</strong> to keep you off the enemy radar, <strong>Forward Intel </strong>for more information on the enemy team’s position, and <strong>Cold Blooded</strong> to avoid enemy scorestreaks. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, which will reveal enemies through walls when you spawn, giving you a good idea of where to set up.</p>



<p>As for the Wildcard, <strong>Overkill</strong> is the best option, as you can then run an SMG like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> as your Secondary to cover those close-range engagements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-equipment-to-use-with-sniper">Best Equipment to use with Sniper</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical:</strong> Concussion</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong> Combat Axe</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong> Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The Concussion is perfect for breaching rooms and stopping enemies from pushing you while you have a Sniper out. It also gives you the time you need to quickscope an enemy while they’re hunting you down, stunning them in their tracks. The Combat Axe is a classic and it should be on every Sniper loadout just for style points. It’s not the easiest to hit, but once you master the COmbat Axe, it can be very useful tool for close-range engagements.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Field Upgrade, whenever you’re set up in a nice spot on any of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a>, you’ll want to cover yourself to prevent any flanker from shooting you in the back, so the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a great pick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't a surprise that people would be excited for the new Call of Duty game, as the franchise has been a mainstay in the gaming industry for years. To celebrate the launch, Activision has put a lot of work into the marketing for the game, and it's claimed by the UK network EE and BT that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has drawn the largest traffic ever for a game launch in the country. If this is true, this is a huge milestone for the franchise and for Activision, but it also doesn't come as much of a surprise, considering how much Activision spent on marketing for this game.</p>
<p>What does come as a surprise is the peak for the number of players flocking to their PC and Consoles wasn't on the day of launch for the game; instead, it was October 21, which is when everyone who pre-ordered it would be able to pre-load the game ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is also a huge game, as it's the first game to be available on Xbox Game Pass as a day-one release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone are also available to those who have Game Pass Ultimate. <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/10/black-ops-6-drives-biggest-ever-uk-gaming-traffic-on-ee-and-bt-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to ISPreview</a>, EE / BT saw a 144% increase in Xbox Live traffic on the broadband network compared to the week before. This is quite a monumental amount of traffic, but it isn't too surprising, as Call of Duty games are known for having huge download sizes. While there were reports that the game would be a whopping 300 GB, it isn't that big, thankfully. However, the game does still come in at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">sizable 102 GB</a> for pre-load,&nbsp; which, for a lot of people, will take a lot of time to install. Because of this, it makes perfect sense that the traffic for the game would increase so heavily on the pre-load day, as no one wants to be waiting around on release day trying to install a game at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any official figures released on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been performing since release, but it has only been a couple of days thus far. It will be interesting to see the metrics for the number of players who come from Game Pass, as it is a significantly cheaper way to access the game than paying for the title outright, something that isn't an option for many gamers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-simplifies-fortnite-progression-with-unified-battle-pass-xp.1021137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle pass progression will work, and if you like to play different&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences outside of the standard battle royale mode, you'll like this one.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>website, Epic says that by December 1st, all battle passes in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will progress simultaneously, and you won't need to earn different kinds of XP to make progress along their tracks.</p>

<p>Right now, for instance, to make progress in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s battle pass, you'd have to earn Festival Points, while to move along&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s battle pass, you'd need Studs. Starting from December, however, that will no longer be the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=n-vlRSaC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=PpwkTkaE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Soon, all of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle passes will use the same XP to progress.</figcaption></figure><p>This change also means that whenever you earn XP in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s experiences, whether that's the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, or any number of others, you'll gain XP for all battle passes.</p>

<p>Of course, you will still need to purchase the battle passes in question; Epic hasn't lost its mind, after all. Still, it's nice to know that you can be playing any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode and not miss out on valuable XP elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first pass to get this treatment will be the Music Pass, which will be released as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s sixth season on November 2nd. After that, on December 1st, the "Brick or Treat"&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>pass will adopt the new system, and all passes from that point on will use the new method.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this change, passes in&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Festival&nbsp;</em>will change to a single track with free and premium rewards, which is the same way the battle royale pass currently works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=3mUA-Lqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=zbEJF1Iw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>will use Epic's new battle pass progression system.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, the game is currently being used by none other than <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kamala-harris-is-courting-gamers-using-fortnite-in-the-last-week-of-the-us-presidential-campaign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris</a> in order to drum up support for the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue">board games of Hasbro</a> are also making their way to&nbsp;Epic's game<em>&nbsp;</em>in the form of custom maps. The first one's based around <em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo</em>, and others will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game. Historically this has been the kind of thing that players have had to just apply to a game’s hero through their own imaginations, so I was happy to see BioWare went the extra step to codify it for those who want to play a trans Rook.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Rather, it comes a few hours into the game when you unlock Rook’s quarters in the Lighthouse base. This isn’t something you can miss, so if you’ve started your own playthrough and haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry, you just haven’t gotten to this point in the game. When you’re setting up Rook’s room, one of the items you’ll put down is a handheld mirror. This gives Rook a moment of self reflection and you the opportunity to add some backstory to your character based on things you included in the character creator. Personally, I chose to talk about my tattoos and speak a little lore for my hero into the universe. But there’s one option that allows you to touch on Rook’s gender identity, specifically stating that your character is transgender. This isn’t tied to anything specific in the character creator, so no matter what options you choose while making them, you can still have a trans Rook in your story.</p><figure id="" data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The three options include “I’m getting there,” “I love who I am,” and “Feels good to see the real me,” so you can designate your trans identity and also color in where you think they are in their personal journey. This will unlock some dialogue options throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> that allow you to discuss this aspect of your identity with other characters, so it’s not just a thing you have to internalize. However, as far as I can tell after finishing the game, if you don’t pick this option when you’re setting up Rook’s room, it doesn’t come up again later. So be sure to go down this dialogue path when you’re examining the mirror if you want to play as a trans Rook and have it be recognized in dialogue. It just might give you a point of common connection with some characters that will enrich your story throughout.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s a grown man sporting stubble and working as a renowned chef. The social media post has since been removed, but not before garnering much attention from fans who grew up watching the animated series before it concluded in 2010.

From weeknights around the dinner table eating his mom’s ‘Spa-Peggy and Meatballs,’ to overindulging in lutefisk at church potlucks, to celebrations with family and friends at Luly’s Cafeteria, food and the people it’s enjoyed with are the foundation for his best memories. In fact, his career as a robata chef was inspired by his most cherished memory of all—weekends spent grilling with his dad.<br></p><p>A self-taught chef and one of the youngest contestants on King of the Grill, Chef Hill believes ‘good food can solve any problem.’ He draws on the influences of his childhood by combining classic Texas dishes with flavors from around the world. With Robata Chane, Chef Hill hopes to honor the art of Japanese robata and the German heritage of the Texas Hill Country while pushing culinary boundaries through his innovative fusion dishes.”<br></p><p>Pamela Adlon, the original voice actress for Bobby Hill, returns to reprise her role. Ahead of the upcoming revival, she revealed that Bobby Hill is now 21 years old, works as a renowned chef in a fusion restaurant in Dallas, Texas, and is traversing adult life with aplomb.<br></p><p>Alongside Adlon’s return as Bobby Hill, long-time fans will also recognize Kathy Najimy, Stephen Root, and Mike Judge, all reprising their original roles as Peggy, Bill, and Hank, respectively. Before his passing in 2023, Johnny Hardwick was able to record a few episodes as Dale, though it’s unclear who will tackle the role moving forward. Fans worry they’ll move forward with a silent Dale or, even worse, an electrolarynx due to his years of chain smoking.</p><p><em>King of the Hill</em> returns sometime in the near future, premiering on Hulu, though we don’t yet have an official release date. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
