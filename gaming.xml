            <p>New action games, in the style of Devil May Cry and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, need to offer more than just great graphics. That's what Hideki Kamiya thinks, and he should know - he's behind some of the genre's very best, including Bayonetta and Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371">Famitsu</a> alongside Morbid Metal creator Felix Schade (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/">Automaton</a>), Kamiya has expressed his desire to create new mechanics in his games and not just focus on making them look more visually impressive - a part of the conversation that came about after explaining how the door loading screens in the original Resident Evil were added to stop players staring at a black screen for six seconds.</p>
<p>"When I make a new game, I try to come up with a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game," he said. "For example, in Bayonetta it was the Witch Time system where dodging an enemy attack slows down time, and in Okami, it was the Celestial Brush, which lets you directly affect the game world by drawing."</p>
<p>Kamiya added that he's not really drawn to a game that is only offering pretty graphics - he's looking for more: "As a player, I want to get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer."</p><p>The genre as a whole, though, Kamiya reckons is in a good spot: "Until not too long ago, there weren't many 3D action games around, but recently there have been a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles. I think that's a result of growing demand, and as someone who also wants to make that kind of action game one day, it makes me happy to see."</p>
<p>Fans of Hideki Kamiya's work were thrilled at December 2024's announcement he was working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">sequel to Okami</a> at his Clovers studio, in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

						<h5>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </h5><p><span>October 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In recent years, the trend for core Pokémon RPGs has been to push for ever-larger sandboxes, with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> offering a full-on Breath-of-the-Wild-style open world. The newly-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> bucks that particular trend, instead restricting the critter catching to a single relatively compact city map, while introducing a number of other tweaks to the Pokémon blueprint.</p>



<p>Will Pokémon Legends: Z-A transform fans into enthusiastic city slickers? Or will you be left yearning for a return to nature? Here are the ABCs of Z-A...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A casts players as a tourist visitor to Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis last seen in 2013's Pokémon X and Y. Lumiose is in the midst of an ambitious redevelopment plan, which aims to create a city where Pokémon and humans can live side-by-side in an urban environment. As you might expect, this isn't going entirely smoothly, with some residents concerned about the growing percentage of the city being transformed into "wild zone" Pokémon habitats and rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon causing havoc.</p>



<p>You’re quickly drawn into the intrigue of Lumiose City when you’re recruited by the eager Taunie/Urbain (their gender depends on the gender of your main character) to join their band of Pokemon-training friends, Team MZ. Before long, you’re set up in a room at the quaint Hotel Z and fully immersed in the Z-A Royale, a competition held by the Quasartico Corporation to determine the best trainers in Lumiose, with ranks going from, you guessed it, Z to A. It's up to you to earn your way to the top while figuring out the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolutions and what's going on in the mysteriously shuttered Prism Tower at the heart of Lumiose City.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you shouldn’t come into Pokémon Legends: Z-A expecting Tolstoy, the story here is better than a good percentage of previous Pokémon RPGs. You also get an unusually strong cast of characters for a Pokémon game, with most of the members of your Team MZ squad, from the ever-earnest Taunie, to the spunky wannabe dancer Lida, to the fanboy fashion designer Naveen, being likable, or at least memorable.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rest of the town is populated with an array of other unique personalities, with some even being recognizable for those who played Pokémon X and Y (Professor Mable has come a long way from her role as a minor villain in X/Y). Even the game's sidequests are fairly interesting, with your typical "fetch this item or Pokémon" quests being mixed with more original stuff, like a Pokémon scavenger hunt in Lumiose City’s surprisingly-expansive Pokémon museum. This is one of the first Pokémon games in a while where I wasn't just interested in the landscape and the Pokémon I can find there, but also the game's characters and the society they inhabit. This really is one of the richest-feeling Pokémon worlds to date.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case despite the fact that the game’s map is, undeniably, quite small. You could probably run from one side to the other in a couple of minutes, but Game Freak does a lot with their limited real estate. The map is somewhat maze-like, which makes it feel bigger than it is, and the city's rooftops and even parts of its sewer system are fully explorable. There are also plenty of Lumiose City tourist traps to distract you along the way, like the aforementioned museum and scads of clothes shops and cafes. Did I miss the greater sense of geographic variety and scale we got in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet? I did at times, but not as often or as badly as I was expecting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This bustling little world looks quite nice as well. While some folks looking to drum up negative engagement had a field day trashing Z-A before its release, the reality is, this is far and away the best-looking Pokémon game to date when playing on Nintendo Switch 2. Obviously, if you're expecting this game to measure up to mega-budgeted PS5 RPGs, you're going to be disappointed, and the game's buildings do look rather flat and blocky. That said, the things people actually care about, the Pokémon and their human trainers, look super sharp (the designs for human characters are particularly good this time around). On Switch 2, everything ran at a consistent 60fps without much in the way of visual glitches. The visual difference between Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Scarlet/Violet is night and day.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, a well-designed world doesn’t mean all that much without solid core gameplay to match, and thankfully, Pokémon Legends: Z-A delivers on that front too. The game opts for a new action/menu-based hybrid system, in which battles take place in real time with trainers fully immersed in the action, but attacks are still selected manually. The system is very approachable, with a simple lock-on function and attacks being mapped to the four face buttons. Eventually, the concept of Mega-Evolved Pokémon is added to the mix, with players being able to temporarily power up some members of their party, but this doesn't complicate matters too much. This system feels like a “best of both worlds” scenario -- the rock-paper-scissors depth of the turn-based Pokémon RPGs hasn't gone anywhere, but battles now play out much quicker and with more of a sense of danger as trainers can get smoked if they don’t stay out of the fray.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This new battle system's greater immediacy also creates increased challenge and tension. This is particularly true of the battles against rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, which take the form of full-on action-packed boss battles with sometimes complex attack patterns you have to keep aware of. These battles were some of the most satisfying challenges I've ever encountered in a core Pokémon game.</p>



<p>Once you get through the game’s early tutorials, Pokémon Legends: Z-A settles into a fairly well-defined gameplay loop. The game rolls out a steady stream of rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon to tackle and at any time you can engage in some sidequests or catch yourself some critters in the city’s wild zones. Catching Pokémon borrows from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-arceus-another-time-and-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, with players able to sneak up on creatures and catch them by simply throwing a Poké Ball at them. Of course, you can also battle wild Pokémon to weaken them first, and, in fact, in a change this series has needed for decades, you can now catch Pokémon for a brief window after they've "fainted." No more being punished for landing a super-effective move!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At night, randomly selected battle zones pop up. Here, you'll take on a succession of other trainers, racking up points to earn a Challenger's Ticket, which, in turn, lets you take on a promotion battle (essentially this game's version of a Gym Leader battle). Here too, players can gain the advantage by sneaking up on opponents, and picking up bonus cards will grant you extra points if you complete specific tasks (knock out an opponent from behind, hit a specific number of water/fire/ground-based attacks, etc.)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This gameplay loop works quite well, and while it could have become repetitive, Z-A largely avoids that. The game lets you skip a large number of ranks at one point (you don't have to rank up 26 times, don't worry) and Game Freak makes an effort to mix up the game's main story missions. Yes, you're still always earning a Challenger’s Ticket to enter a promotion match, but tracking down your opponent and getting them to face you usually isn’t a simple task. You'll find yourself doing things like engaging in a competition with other mega fans of an influencer-trainer in order to win the right to face them, and doing some detective work and delving into the dungeon-like sewers beneath Lumiose to find a missing person before another trainer will face you. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels closer to the rhythms of the various Pokémon anime than most of its predecessors.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to <em>Catch 'em All</em> and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</p>

					<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </h2>

						<section>
				<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next. </p>

            <p>There appear to be a number of issues plaguing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> launch, including bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have listed</a> the highest priority of these, assured players they're being addressed, and suggested workarounds to use in the meantime.</p>
<p>Some workarounds are fairly crude, though. There are people who've found the Lasombra and Toreador clans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">once destined to be paid DLC additions</a> - are still locked when they play. The workaround? Update and reinstall the game. And there's nothing yet to solve crashes on PS5 in particular. All that's said is, "We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5."</p>

<p>The other problems and workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>There's no way to turn off motion-blur.<strong> Workaround: </strong>Try turning post-processing to low</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The game doesn't launch or gets stuck on the starting screen. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Try running the game and launcher as an admin</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>Seattle is not populating correctly (in the game!) with NPCS during quests. <strong>Workaround:</strong> Reload from the last save (an inconvenience considering you can't manually save)</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>The AZERTY keyboard does not work, or keybinding does not work. <strong>Workaround: </strong>Enable the QWERTY layout in Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Other issues mentioned include the lack of a field of vision slider, the ability to disable elements of the HUD, and "facial hair in character customisation" - which I presume means people want more than stubble as an option in the character customiser. But no workarounds or promises are listed alongside these. I assume they're there to say "we've heard you and are working on this".</p>
<p>Otherwise, Paradox, The Chinese Room, and Vampire: The Masquerade IP holder White Wolf thanked players for the support and encouraged them to keep sending in feedback via the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/bloodlines-faq#game-issues">bug report form</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">I reviewed Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 for Eurogamer</a> and sadly I didn't think it was up to much. Every area of the game felt thin and lifeless to me, pardon the pun, though I didn't have an entirely horrible time with it. Some characters were great, some of the action sequences were engaging, particularly later on, and occasionally the fantasy of being a very powerful elder vampire shone through.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is full of content, with Lumiose City packed full of shops to spend your hard-earned cash, and the Stone Emporium is one of the most important locations in the game.</p>



<p>Although not available instantly, the Stone Emporium is a go-to location to purchase items for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trading-stone-special-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special evolutions</a>, as well as fossils to revive in the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>For all the details on where to find the Stone Emporium and the stock available to purchase, our guide has you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Shopping spree. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stone Emporium in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is located on Vernal Avenue, near Wild Zone 1 and to the east of Wild Zone 12</strong>, <strong>but only unlocks once you complete Main Mission 10.</strong></p>



<p>The nearest fast travel point is the Pokémon Center on Vernal Avenue, though you can also use the fast travel points at the Pokémon Research Lab, Cafe Woof, and Cafe Classe.</p>



<p>Available stock increases throughout your playthrough, so make sure to revisit the store regularly to stock up on Mega Stones and Evolution Stones.</p>







<p><strong>The Stone Emporium is the best place in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to get your hands on Evolution Stones, along with being the only place you can purchase particular Mega Stones.</strong></p>



<p>Stock levels increase throughout the game, with some items only becoming available to purchase later on in the main story progression, and remember, you can only purchase each Mega Stone once. However, unlike previous games, you can purchase as many fossils as you want to revive at the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full breakdown of the stock available at the Stone Emporium and prices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has released the Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, which it said is designed to make the game “feel better to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This much anticipated update overhauls how Arrowhead approaches patching “to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us.” The studio said that means “more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. Arrowhead said that while new features are coming, this patch marks “a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it.” More refinements are already underway, the studio continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of balance, the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems is increased. SMGs and pistols, for example, have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons, with increased close-range damage and increased damage falloff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting changes are made to enemies across the board. The Dragon Roach, for example, has seen its spawn rate decreased, and destruction of the wings now results in instant death. Each wing has a health pool, and the Dragon Roach should be more susceptible to explosions because even if you hit the body you now also hit the wings and do more damage. Overall, there should be fewer Dragon Roaches and they should be easier to take down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the patch notes, courtesy of the Helldivers 2 Discord, below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Balancing</strong></h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General changes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Primaries, Sidearms, Throwables, and Stratagems</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improvements have been made to increase the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light vs. Medium Penetration Weapons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Light and medium penetration weapons now offer more distinct advantages.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Light penetration weapons generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies, differentiating them more clearly from medium penetration options</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMGs and Pistols</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>SMGs and pistols have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons.

Discounting them all to the same price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Buy Has Every Final Fantasy Magic Deck Under MSRP</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the positive side, this means you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRRg3?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Limit Break</u></a>, a deck that regularly sells for much more than its MSRP, for $48.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a very fun deck that’s themed around equipment and dealing combat damage, and will no doubt be an easy pickup for anyone who waited for a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the downside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PP6v?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>that means Revival Trance is also $48.99</u></a>. It’s under MSRP, sure, but this deck’s messy game plan and lack of big reprints mean you can snap it up for around $35 elsewhere if you keep an eye out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the quartet, I’ve been having more fun with Scions and Spellcraft recently, the Final Fantasy 14 deck helmed by Y’Shtola. It’s all about pinging opponents around the table for damage, which isn’t something you often get in a blue/white/black deck. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJJdX?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, arguably the best deck from the set, Counter Blitz is helmed by Final Fantasy X’s Tidus and Yuna, and lets you manipulate counters to deal big damage or keep Summons around longer. And, guess what? <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMMj4?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now, too</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each deck also comes with a ‘Collector Booster Sample Pack’ which includes two cards in foil or borderless treatment, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Publisher No More Robots has announced two new games during an eighth anniversary showcase, with these games being pretty different to each other. The first is Cruise Control, a game about managing a cruise fleet, while the second game is about job applications and the job market. That game is called Thank You For Your Application, a phrase surely burnt into the mind of anyone who has applied for jobs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cruise Control -- Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nshhSnPTpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cruise Control, your role is to build up a cruise ship, expanding its offerings, and keeping cruise enthusiasts happy. You will need to fill the ship with amenities like restaurants and gyms, plus entertainment rooms such as bingo halls, dance halls, arcades, spas, gaming halls, and cinemas. The more popular your cruise gets, the more people that will want to set sail with you so you will need to keep expanding and refreshing those offerings. A ship needs a crew though, so you will need to hire maintenance staff to keep the ship going smoothly and keeping it tidy. Cruise Control will also feature an Elite Cruises mode where you will compete with other players to climb the leaderboard. A beta test will be taking place soon, and to join you have to go the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fx82V8Tn7eM">Cruise Control Discord</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thank You For Your Application - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zbCEwIakw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thank You For Your Application looks like a game that fans of Papers, Please will be interested in. You play as a junior interviewer for Aeropolis, the biggest company in the world. Your role is to interview candidates and send thank you letters, but there is a secret to uncover too. There will be lots of interviews to do, and robots are also eligible to take jobs from humans. You will earn money but will need to be on top of things like rent, so you do not become an illegal resident. Thank You For Your Application has a branching narrative which is affected by the choices you make, and you can try out a demo for the game now by going to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881370/Thank_You_For_Your_Application/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <p>Paradox have outlined some workarounds for a number of "high priority" issues which have been draining folks' ability to get sucked into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> now the gates to Seattle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cannot-possibly-be-on-sale-now">are open</a>. Proper fixes for these and other known issues are also in the works, as is planning for post-release additions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-thank-you-and-upcoming-plans">blog post</a> which kicks off with a nice thank you, the studio quickly got down to brass tacks. "From your comments, we also know there are some players who are facing issues," they wrote. "While we continue working on the post-release plans for Bloodlines 2, we’d like to address some of those immediately and provide possible workarounds so that as many of you as possible can return to enjoying the game. As part of this process, we want to thank everybody who’s taken the time to fill out the bug report form. It helps us immensely to get an overview of what issues people are facing!"</p>
<p>They proceeded to outline some of the workarounds they've devised for "high priority" issues. Folks who're struggling to get the Bloodlines 2 to launch or are getting stuck on its starting screen are advised to try running it as an admin. Those unable to use their AZERTY keyboard or bind keys as they should might find "adding the QWERTY keyboard layout in Windows" to be a solution. Finally, if your version of Seattle isn't "populating correctly with NPCs" during certain quests, reloading your last save from the main menu's worth a shot.</p>
<p>"We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5," Paradox added. Regarding known bugs like the Lasombra and Toreador being locked at the clan selection screen on some platforms, we recommend updating and reinstalling the game."</p><p>Finally, they're aware players have indicated they're not happy with things like the the lack of an FOV slider, not being able to turn off bits of the HUD, and underwhelming beard/moustache options. Rounding out that list of gripes is not being able to turn off motion blur, with the studio recommending you "try turning post-processing to low" in that case.</p>
<p>"Your passion, feedback, and patience mean the world to us, and we’re committed to continuing to improve Bloodlines 2," the post concluded. "The story of Seattle’s Kindred is only just beginning."</p>
<p>While the work they're putting in might not revamp things to the extent it's worth substantially re-evaluating whether Bloodlines 2 lives up to its moniker as a sequel to a beloved classic, here's hoping it can poke things from the merely ok territory Dominic Tarason spoke of in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a> towards the unquestionably good realm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Mods</a> will also likely help achieve that goal.</p>

            <p>The George Foreman grill, sorry… PlayStation 3, has now been outsold by the PS5 in the US. Sony's newest machine has achieved this feat in a fraction under five years on sale (PS5 launched 12th November 2020).</p>
<p>Respected <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella shared the piece of trivia on Bluesky</a>, noting that the sales-overtake had happened during September's sales period.</p>
<p>"September 2025 US video game data fun fact - The PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base," Piscatella wrote. "So that's cool."</p>
<p>He didn't share numbers - Circana charges for that sort of thing - but did mention in replies that PS5 sales are also ahead of PS4 on "a time-aligned basis" in the US, and have been for "a very long time". "PS5 is ahead of PS4 by 4.6 percent," he wrote.</p><p>As a reference point, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">Sony's business website lists global lifetime PS4 sales</a> at more than 113.5m (as of September 2020), lifetime PS3 sales at more than 87.4m (as of March 2017), and lifetime PS2 sales - the company's best-selling machine - at more than 160m (as of March 2012). Given the dates attached to those counts, those figures have likely since changed.</p>
<p>Sony announced in its last financial report in August that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary">PlayStation 5 had sold 80.3m units</a> in total - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-lifetime-sales-on-par-with-ps4-but-sony-relying-on-third-party-game-success">a pace which has roughly been the same as PS4's</a>, on a like-for-like basis, for a while. The next batch of financial results is due 11th November.</p>
<p>However, Sony is expecting sales of PS5 to slow, both because it believes the console has passed its sales peak and, I expect, because of the challenging economic conditions and tariffs the market is facing. Console prices for this generation have never been higher.</p>
<p>It's a strange footing to be on when thinking about planning the next generation of consoles. But as I found out recently, perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is about to change</a>.</p>

			<p>There's no doubt that Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios's first new intellectual property in over twenty-five years, did not ignite as much passion in the studio's fans as its other franchises, Elder Scrolls and Fallout, have done before. Even Bruce Nesmith, who worked on Starfield as well as more successful releases like Fallout 3 and 4 and Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim over the course of his 17-year-long career at Bethesda, admitted that while a good game, the latest release of the studio isn't in the same caliber as the other two series they're known for.</p>



<p><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to FRVR</a>, Nesmith, who left Bethesda in late 2021 and is now a full-time science fiction author, said that the problem was not space, which is kinda boring by default. The issue was rather with how the game failed to populate the planets with engaging enemies and things to do.</p>



<p><em>I’m an enormous space fan, I’m an amateur astronomer, I’m up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data, but space is inherently boring. It’s literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn’t where the excitement is, in my opinion. But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don’t start to feel the excitement on the planets, that’s to me where it falls apart. I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there’s lots of cool alien creatures, but they’re like the wolves in Skyrim. They’re just there, they don’t contribute, you don’t have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I think Nesmith nailed the explanation. I also felt that the exploration loop that Bethesda fans love in Elder Scrolls and Fallout was missing for some reason. In those games, often the best experience comes simply by exploring the map without even caring about the story missions, but that's because they are littered with interesting discoveries, dungeons, and encounters. </p>



<p>Starfield really lacked in that. Whether it was due to the procedural generation system (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-have-benefited-from-daggerfall-like-proc-gen-for-dungeons-instead-of-reusing-premade-ones-says-oncelost-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was criticized by fellow developers from OnceLost Games</a>) or the fact that they felt like the space planets had to be emptier due to the lore, I cannot say. </p>



<p>Still, Bethesda hasn't stopped working on the game. They recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new story DLC, new gameplay systems, and some space changes. According to the latest rumors, all this new content should launch alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-announcement-is-rumored-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PlayStation 5 version</a> sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond was recently featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy video interview with Mashable</a> as part of the press tour for the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). We already covered her comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the next-generation console being 'very premium and very high-end'</a>, but there's also another interesting tidbit in that interview: Bond's statement about game exclusives, which she labeled as antiquated.  </p>



<p><em>We're really seeing people evolve way past that. Like the biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox. That's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. They have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience because it just opens up another way for you to play. As does cloud, as does PC, as does the consoles that we all own and have in our living room.</em></p>



<p>Bond's statement comes as no surprise given Microsoft's u-turn on exclusives. Xbox did attempt to pursue exclusives for its Xbox consoles for around fifteen years or so, even going as far as making pricey deals with Japanese developers for games like Ninja Gaiden, Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, and Ace Combat 6 to name a few.</p>



<p>However, that effort eventually dwindled down alongside the Xbox One's weak exclusives output. In 2016, Microsoft started bringing all its exclusive games to Windows PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-pushed-quantum-break-pc-delay-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Remedy's Quantum Break</a>. That was the first extension of what an Xbox was. Much more recent is their choice to port first-party games to rival consoles like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch. This major strategy shift took place in February 2024, when following a series of rumors Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Obsidian's Grounded and Pentiment, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and Tango's Hi-Fi Rush would be released on the PS4/5 and/or Switch.</p>



<p>Many more games have since followed, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Forza Horizon 5, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and DOOM: The Dark Ages. This month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2 will launch day and date on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft is really now looking to bring its games to as many devices as possible, but that's because, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-has-lost-the-console-wars-next-gen-consoles-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">candidly admitted in 2023</a>, they have lost the console wars. Sarah Bond also mentioned live service games, which certainly benefit from being available on the widest possible amount of platforms, but Sony and Nintendo, especially the latter, still put a lot of importance in non-live service games which can definitely boost hardware sales when exclusive to their console.</p>



<p>On one hand, I do wish all games were released across all platforms immediately. It would certainly be a big win for all gamers. On the other, I understand Sony and Nintendo's current stance, even though the former is already slowly moving toward multiplatform releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Players Are Arguing About Unrealistic Skins Again]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-arguing-about-unrealistic-skins-again.1332415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s first season approaches, and in the run-up to the inevitable drop, fans have started discussing the content coming in the impending update. One of the key points of contention involves a new <strong>blue </strong>skin, dubbed ‘Wicked Grin’. It’s one of the least unrealistic skins showcased so far for Battlefield 6, and some fans feel it’s the beginning of the end.</p>



<p>It has gotten to the point of a fierce debate on social platforms, with some diehard fans berating Electronic Arts and all associated studios for ‘already tainting’ Battlefield 6 with bizarre skins.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s that bad?</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-wicked-grin-skin-is-causing-fights">Battlefield 6’s Wicked Grin Skin is Causing Fights</h2>



<p>On social media, users shared images of the blue Wicked Grin skin, coming to Battlefield 6 with the season one update and assumedly being part of some Halloween-themed campaign.</p>



<p>It’s the most divisive skin yet, even more so than the skin that boasted some <strong>bright green elements </strong>that split the community down the middle a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>EA DICE announced that Battlefield 6 would be much more grounded ahead of release, and some have condemned the studio for already breaking that promise, less than two weeks after the launch of the game. Battlefield 6 has proven to be a marvel so far, with the community loving almost everything on offer, but these potentially destructive skins are not going down well with fans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, one user wrote, ‘Man, that looks f***ing dumb,’ while another asked, ‘Why is it so much to ask for just regular military uniforms? Nobody is using this s***.’</p>



<p>Others defended the skin: ‘This is cherry-picked from a large selection of mostly regular military outfits. This sub is a cesspool, so I expect no different, but this is laughably misrepresented.’</p>



<p>Some have argued that it’s ‘far more grounded’ than some of the most inane Call of Duty skins, such as the Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj crossovers that brought <strong>the strangest outfits </strong>to the Activision-backed shooter.</p>



<p>Do you think the Wicked Grin skin is so awful that you won’t want to see anyone wearing it in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-2025-what-to-expect/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-fallout-day-2025%E2%80%94here%E2%80%99s-what-to-expect.1332406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every year on October 23, the Fallout community comes together to celebrate Fallout Day, an official tribute to the franchise that recognizes the date in the game’s universe on which <strong>the bombs fell</strong>. It was the spark that ignited The Great War, bringing about the end of the world and the start of the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>This year, the rumors have been circulating like wildfire, with many believing that Bethesda Game Studios is about to reveal a remaster of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. We know a few things that are happening this Fallout Day, but what’s set to unravel as the day goes on?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-remastered-being-revealed-today">Is Fallout 3 Remastered Being Revealed Today?</h2>



<p>It’s Fallout Day, and that means a few things.</p>



<p>First, it means that Fallout fans worldwide are diving into their favorite post-apocalyptic games, soaking up the irradiated action that has evolved over the last quarter of a century. Second, it means that special streams, offers, and reveals are set to drop.</p>



<p>Later today, Bethesda Game Studios will host a special Fallout Day broadcast, and the consensus is that a new game, such as Fallout 3 Remastered or New Vegas Remastered, will be unveiled.</p>



<p>Some have even theorized that a Fallout Shelter 2 will shadowdrop.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Fallout team revealed a glimpse of what’s coming this Fallout Day:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fallout Day is almost here! Tomorrow at 1 PM ET, join us for a special broadcast packed with:</p><p>✅ Fallout 76: Burning Springs Updates<br>✅ Fallout Shelter<br>✅ Fallout 4 and Creations<br>✅ New Merch Drops<br>✅ Community In-Person Events<br>✅ And a post-show celebrating the community! <a href="https://t.co/kcNTLrSf8E">pic.twitter.com/kcNTLrSf8E</a></p></div>— Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1981020245226594611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Let’s break down that list.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 76: Burning Springs </strong>is likely a more in-depth look at the upcoming expansion, which brings Walton Goggins’ character ‘The Ghoul’ from the television show to the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout Shelter </strong>is seen by many as the sudden unveiling of a new release to expand the best-selling mobile-first game, but it’s more likely a new update of sorts or a limited-time event.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 4 and Creations </strong>is the outlier in the list, as nobody is sure of what that means. It could be more officially-backed mods finding their way into the Creations platform on Fallout 4, or it could be something else entirely. Last year, Fallout 4 received a current-gen upgrade, and nothing has really changed since then. In just a couple of weeks, Fallout 4 will hit its <strong>tenth anniversary</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe we’ll see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-this-november/">Fallout 4: 10th Anniversary Edition</a>… Who knows?</p>



<p>New merchandise is available for fans to purchase, and a limited-time 40% discount is available in the Bethesda Gear Store. Also, a special post-show has been announced, set up to celebrate <strong>the community</strong> behind Fallout. This will be backed by the Fallout for Hope charity initiative and will last at least three hours.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-fallout-day-2025-stream">Where to Watch Fallout Day 2025 Stream</h2>



<p>The easiest way to watch Fallout Day 2025 is via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda Game Studios’ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the official stream will run, and if you miss it, you can check out the VOD to catch up on what was announced.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s when to watch Fallout Day 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>1 PM ET</li>



<li>6 PM BST</li>



<li>10 AM PT</li>



<li>7 PM CEST</li>
</ul>

<p>Two new unlisted Switch 2 lifestyle commercials for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> have been spotted on Nintendo's official YouTube page. They're titled "Power Up Your Holidays", so we'll seemingly be seeing them in the lead up to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Although these new trailers are only around 16 seconds each and spend a lot of that time focused on the player, they apparently include some <strong>spoilers</strong> about Samus' new adventure – so we would advise you navigate away from this page right now if you don't want to ruin any surprises for yourself.</p>
<p>Right, with this warning out of the way, you can see two bosses. One is called Xelios (a new "spherical" boss) and the other is known as Carvex (a "plant" boss which you might have already seen). We've taken screen captures, just in case Nintendo's trailers end up disappearing. You can see them at the bottom of these videos:</p>



<p>Nintendo has also ramped up its coverage of all-things Metroid this week with a bunch of <em>other</em> Metroid-related announcements. This includes the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II</a> soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, and also some promotion of the upcoming Metroid Prime 1-3 art book. Nintendo has added a new Metroid reward to the My Nintendo Store, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Woojer Strap 4 Review—Small Size, Mighty Feedback]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-strap-4-review-mighty-feedback/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer-strap-4-review%E2%80%94small-size-mighty-feedback.1332397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I received a Woojer Strap 4 alongside the Woojer Vest 4, and I was eager to see how the two devices stacked up against one another. While the Woojer Vest 4 is reserved more for immersive VR experiences, the Strap 4 is a more compact, simpler device that offers a scaled-down feedback experience.</p>



<p>What I found was that the Woojer Strap 4 shouldn’t be discredited just because it’s a smaller thing. This haptic feedback device offers a punchy solution for <strong>feeling audio</strong>, and whether you use it for games or music, you’ll be impressed with what it can do.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Woojer Strap 4 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-woojer-strap-4-is-energy-in-a-compact-package">Woojer Strap 4 is Energy in a Compact Package</h2>



<p>While the Woojer Vest 4 (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-vest-4-review-new-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I also reviewed</a>) is a full upper body solution, the Woojer Strap 4 is a single, simple, and discrete device that offers immense versatility. It’s designed to be used however you want, and with that in mind, it can be worn in several ways. Whether you want a low-cost immersion element for VR or something to enhance your enjoyment of music, this is it.</p>



<p>The Strap 4 is less than half the price of the full Woojer Vest 4, so it’s a no-brainer if you want an introduction to the haptic world without breaking the bank. You’ll be paying around $125 for the strap, which comes in a range of colorways and themes, and there are even some special edition straps featuring branding from top games like Black Ops 7 and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Once you’ve unboxed your Woojer Strap 4, you’ll find that the setup process is so swift and simple, and the Woojer app allows full customization of the device where sound profiles, inputs and outputs, and RGB layouts are concerned.</p>



<p>Putting on the Strap 4 takes seconds, and it’s designed to fit all body types. Even my larger frame was perfectly comfortable enveloped by the Strap 4. Once on, you’ll start blasting sound through the Strap 4, noticing how the punchy transducer translates all inputted sound into powerful, vibration-based haptic feedback.</p>



<p>It’s weird at first, but stick with it.</p>



<p>On a single charge, the Woojer Strap 4 can last around ten hours, which is about the same amount of time as you’d get with the Vest 4, only the Strap 4 takes less time to recharge. It’s a diverse thing that can be connected wirelessly via Bluetooth or wired with a range of inputs that accommodate almost every kind of device you might want to use.</p>



<p>At just 240 g, you’ll hardly notice the Woojer Strap 4, but you’ll feel those audio cues without a doubt. At the highest sensitivity, the Strap 4 will hit like a 12-gauge alongside certain sound profiles. I used the Strap 4 with a variety of games, but like the Vest 4, it felt the best for me with an explosive first-person shooter like Battlefield 6 or Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>You really do feel every shot, explosion, and punch.</p>



<p>It might seem like a bit of a gimmick, but if you want the most immersive gaming solutions possible, something like the Woojer Strap 4 should be right up your street.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Strap 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-vest-4-review-new-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer-vest-4-review%E2%80%94new-generation-same-great-feeling.1332388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Woojer is back with another iteration of the Vest, an innovative haptic device that allows you to feel the games you play. It’s a somewhat comical device at first blush that reveals itself as something quite impressive on use, and having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used the Woojer Vest 3</a> a year ago, I can attest to the Woojer Vest 4 being an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>With the Woojer Vest 4, users can secure punchy haptic feedback from any audio experience, but it’s marketed much more for <strong>gaming</strong>. That’s where I connected with the Woojer Vest 4, linking up with some pulse-pounding games to get the most out of this device.</p>



<p>Is the Woojer Vest 4 worth it? Find out in this snapshot review.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-woojer-vest-4-any-good">Is The Woojer Vest 4 Any Good?</h2>



<p>I was very familiar with Woojer, having used the Vest 3 for many hours across desktop and VR gaming experiences. It was a seamless transition into the Vest 4, which takes on mostly the same form and function but boasts a few changes. I noticed that it <strong>felt more comfortable </strong>to wear, despite there being few differences in the makeup of the Vest itself.</p>



<p>As I mentioned, the Woojer Vest 4 might look funny at first glance, but there’s a lot of clever technology lurking under the surface. This haptic device boasts six transducers that offer immensely powerful and physical feedback when playing games.</p>



<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with the concept, the Woojer Vest 4 offers physical and haptic feedback in collaboration with the sound emitted from your games, music, and movies. It takes an input and cleverly translates that into vibration and shocking feedback, allowing you to feel, at multiple points around your body, the sound that you’re hearing.</p>



<p>I was eager to use the Woojer Vest 4 in a few rounds of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, so I connected the device to my PC and linked it with my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/">Astro A50 headset</a> and <strong>felt every gunshot, explosion, and rumble of tank tracks</strong>.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Woojer Vest 4, it’s that the latency is a bit off-putting for reflexive gameplay, and even the in-built low-latency mode that can be activated via the Woojer app doesn’t change much.</p>



<p>That being said, it wasn’t a deal-breaker. The Woojer Vest 4 is truly a one-size-fits-all device, and it even accommodated my much larger frame for several hours (note: battery life is advertised as 10 hours maximum). If you play VR in tandem with the Woojer Vest 4 (like I did), you’ll get a little toasty under the device, but it’s designed to be as breathable as possible.</p>



<p>If you’ve never seen or used a Woojer Vest, you’ll quickly get to grips with the Vest 4. It’s easy to use, comes with handy start-up guides, and has an app with a clean UI that makes it a wonder to use. The front-facing control unit is easy to reach, there’s a nice spot of RGB lighting, and the inputs are tactile.</p>



<p>There are so few things I found that turned me off from the Woojer Vest 4. Even the price point has come down from the near $500 heights of the Woojer Vest 3. It’s now floating around $340, which is more comfortable. Talking of comfort, the Vest 4 comes in at around 1.6 kg, which is nothing when you consider the weight is distributed around your back, shoulders, and chest.</p>



<p>If you’re a VR fan and want to make your experiences much more immersive, I’d say the Woojer Vest 4 is an easy buy. If you’re a console or desktop-based gamer, it’s perhaps less worthwhile, and if you’re interested in getting the vest for movies or music, I’d probably suggest reconsidering that decision.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Vest 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sound Blaster Katana V2X Soundbar Review]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X ‘gaming soundbar’ ticked more than a few boxes for me. It was punchy, easy to use, and it had a tasty splash of RGB that made it a tantalising pick for any gamer. When I was putting together my Katana V2X review, I put this two-part soundbar through its paces, and I’m pleased to say that it impressed me in every aspect.</p>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X from Creative is the culmination of decades of work in the audio space, and it’s a compact yet powerful thing that looks great and works with just about any device you connect to it.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full review of the Sound Blaster Katana V2X soundbar.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-katana-v2x-soundbar-is-power-in-a-small-package">The Katana V2X Soundbar is Power in a Small Package</h2>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X is a perfectly sized solution for gamers short on space but eager to achieve some of the best audio results possible. The soundbar measures just 600mm by 95mm and has a height profile of just 62mm, which means it should fit nicely in front of, under, or behind any setup, television or otherwise.</p>



<p>This soundbar comes with a company subwoofer that’s 423mm tall, 250mm deep, and 116mm wide, and despite that scaled-down size factor, I found it to be a <strong>very </strong>capable piece of equipment. It adds a tasty touch of bass to the core soundbar without needing anything more than a coaxial connection to the back of the device.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about that sound power.</p>



<p>The Katana V2X soundbar boasts tri-amplified amps and represents an evolution of the earlier models of the same soundbar. It has two mid-range drivers, two tweeters, and the bolt-on subwoofer drive, all of which combine to produce a deep audio range, cinematic diversity, and stunning clarity.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take much to run the Katana V2X soundbar, and you can connect it to <strong>almost anything </strong>via Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI ARC, optical, aux, and USB-C. I would be blasting music via my phone in one minute, then pressing a single button and connecting to a PS5 in the next.</p>



<p>This multi-functional soundbar even has built-in microphones, which is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have. It’s all customizable too, and the sound profiles, RGB strip, and saved settings can all be tweaked.</p>



<p>Creative has been in the business of audio technology since 1981, and the Sound Blaster technology has been tried, tested, and optimized over <strong>many</strong> <strong>years</strong>. It’s now at a point where the Katana V2X soundbar should be considered one of the best gaming soundbars you can get for the price.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the Katana V2X soundbar, it’ll set you back around $259 – $280, depending on where you buy it. I’d say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re looking for a compact yet powerful audio solution, preferably being twinned with a TV and home console arrangement.</p>

<p>If you haven't been keeping a close eye on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales Of</a> series, Bandai Namco is reviving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia</a> as a remaster next week. So, what about <strong>Tales of Xillia 2</strong>?</p>
<p>According to a new Famitsu interview, series director Yusuke Tomizawa has mentioned how a remaster of the sequel is "still in progress" – it just hasn't been formally announced yet, and he promises to share more information as soon as possible (translations via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> [Remastered] is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced.

</blockquote>
<p>As for the "next remastered title" in the fantasy role-playing series, the team can't "provide the specifics" just yet, but the announcement is planned to take place "relatively soon". It's also mentioned how there are "more than two titles" currently in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 has revealed its roadmap for 2026 ahead of its release and hints at some new free and paid DLC.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cozy games, PowerWash Simulator is a familiar name to all. The simple maintenance simulator took the world by storm in 2022, getting everyone to do something many hate doing: cleaning. With its huge popularity, the game teamed up with iconic IPs like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2024-every-game-shown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek</a>. A sequel was announced earlier this year, with a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed just this month</a>. Now, with its release in a few hours, Futurlabs has shown off its planned roadmap for 2026, as well as how it’ll spend 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-planning-three-major-paid-free-dlc-in-2026-teases-crossovers">PowerWash Simulator Planning Three Major Paid + Free DLC in 2026, Teases Crossovers</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have our PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap to share with you all 💦</p><p>Coming in 2025/2026 ⤵️</p><p>– 3 Paid IP DLC<br>– 3 Free Caldera Chronicles Jobs<br>– A bucket full of other planned additions</p><p>For the rest of 2025 we’re focusing on fixes, further optimisations and QOL improvements! <a href="https://t.co/eUOk2bfEzP">pic.twitter.com/eUOk2bfEzP</a></p></div>— PowerWash Simulator (@PowerWashSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from PowerWash Simulator’s <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter/X account</a>, the roadmap for 2026 is now available. As shown above, the team plans to have new paid and free DLC every quarter, starting with Q1. No specifics were given for what to expect, but the free DLC, called the Caldera Chronicles, will likely be similar to the original’s Muckingham Files. As for the paid DLC, it’ll be based on other IPs, so we may see some zany crossovers like last time. </p>



<p>Additionally, updates to the game, including community events and costumes, will be added over time. No DLC or new content is coming out in 2025, as the team plans to focus on QoL and optimization fixes. Reviews for PowerWash Simulator 2 came out today, and, for many, it maintains the charm and fun the original did. Given how much of a sleeper hit it was, its sequel may just give it the attention it deserves. Plus, with a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, it’s sure to keep many of us company (and make us clean freaks again).</p>



<p>Are you excited for PowerWash Simulator 2? What do you hope becomes DLC? Did you enjoy the original? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys’ success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-rumble-sets-november-5th-2025-release-date">Sonic Rumble Sets November 5th, 2025 Release Date</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it’ll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game’s user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won’t be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>

    <p><span>Bandai Namco following an "announce and release what's ready quickly" approach.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>A <em><a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> Xillia 2</em> remaster is underway, and the announcement of the next remastered <em>Tales of</em> game is expected relatively soon, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa said in the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu. <span id="more-1001196"></span></p><p>“We’ve formed teams with several partner development companies, and including projects from the verification stage to the late development stage, there are more than two titles in progress,” Tomizawa said in an interview celebrating the upcoming release of <em><a title="Games > Tales of Xillia Remastered [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-xillia-remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a></em>. “The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Asked if that means the next remastered project will be announced soon, Tomizawa said, “I’m unfortunately unable to provide specifics about the next title yet. But the timing of the next remastered title announcement should be relatively soon… or at least, that’s the plan.”</p><p>As for a remastered <em>Tales of Xillia 2</em>, Tomizawa said, “As mentioned earlier, we’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced. We will do our best to deliver updates as quickly as possible.”</p><p>While there has not been a brand-new entry in the <em>Tales of</em> series since 2021’s <em><a title="Games > Tales of Arise [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise</a></em>, which received a post-game story expansion called “Beyond the Dawn” in 2023, Tomizawa said, “As the <em>Tales of</em> series development team—as we always have throughout the history of the series—we continue to think about and work on new titles. Any announcements regarding a new title will take some time, but alongside the remasters, we are also planning and considering initiatives such as real-life events, merchandise, and various other promotions. Following the 30th anniversary, through the 40th and 50th, we hope to continue creating opportunities for players and characters to experience and share stories in various forms.”</p><p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246670/Tales_of_Xillia_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on October 31.</p><!-- AD: content -->
