            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260438/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-amazon-hiring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox cofounder J Allard joined Amazon last month as a vice president on the company’s devices and services team. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Allard confirmed his new role but says it’s “too early to have anything to say” about what he’ll be working on at Amazon beyond “new ideas.”</p><p>Allard will report to former Windows and Surface chief Panos Panay at Amazon, according <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/">to <em>GeekWire</em></a>. Panay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892462/amazon-hires-panos-panay-microsoft">left Microsoft</a> last year after being at the software giant for almost 20 years. Allard spent more than 20 years at Microsoft, cofounding the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;division, launching&nbsp;Microsoft’s&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Live network, and developing the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;360 console. Allard also oversaw the development of the Zune, Microsoft’s iPod competitor.</p><p>Allard departed Microsoft in 2010, following his work on the company’s canceled Courier tablet. Courier was never officially announced as a Microsoft product, but the leaked concept combined pen and touch into a digital notepad. </p><p>The Courier was reportedly canceled amid infighting between the Courier group led by Allard and the Windows group led at the time by Steven Sinofsky. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly couldn’t choose between Courier and Windows and needed Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/1/2529666/did-bill-gates-kill-courier">step in to make the final decision</a>.</p><p>Since leaving Microsoft, Allard has spent most of his time running <a href="https://project529.com/">Project 529</a>, a community service organization focused on reducing bike theft. Two Three Bird acquired Project 529 earlier this year, freeing up Allard’s time to “orient my energy towards some new ideas.”</p><div>

You could trick-or-treat with them, use them to give out candy, or just chuck them in the closet with the rest of junk in your room, only to be discovered months later like a strange artifact <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spirit-halloween-nbc-snl-saturday-night-live-skit-dead-1851662401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spirit-halloween-nbc-snl-saturday-night-live-skit-dead-1851662401">from a spookier time</a></span>. Well, the Boo Buckets are back for 2024, but not as many remember them.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,197260,197209" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>McDonald’s announced the newest Boo Buckets earlier this week. On sale with Happy Meals starting October 15, the jack-o-lantern and ghost-style faces have been replaced with smiling monsters, and there’s now a blue bucket in addition to the iconic orange, white, and green. I’m sure the kids will like them a lot more. But let’s be honest, Boo Buckets are for adults at this point, and not everyone is onboard with the UwU-fication of a once glorious nostalgia-trip.</p><p>“Tthese look awful and have those garbage fake lids that do nothing but make them harder to hold, do something right or don’t do it at all,” wrote one militant McD’s poster on Twitter. “Can you just rerelease the 90s ones that glow in the dark and have actual lids! Please!!!!” pleaded another. “Also the 90s Halloween McNuggets buddies! I’m giving you free ideas and all is old aholes in our 30s and 40s will give you money!”</p><p>The Instagram comments were even more brutal. “Fire the design department,” read one. “Where’s the glow in the dark one,” read another. “WHERE ARE THE LIDS ??!!!” begged a third. Not everyone is up in arms about the overhaul, though. Some claim they are “cute” or “REALLY EXCITING.” To those oozing with positivity I can only say, in the words of one new Boo Bucket hater, “Some of y’all never had the 1980’s Boo Buckets from McDonalds and it shows.”</p><p>The Boo Buckets were first rolled out in 1986, with several variations and iterations in the years that followed.  The unbranded simplicity was part of their charm. Just pure mashups of late capitalist pastiche and workmanlike utility. It’s also hard to overstate the omnipresent power of McDonald’s at the time, which burned itself onto every child’s retinas through truly excessive ad buys during the afternoon and weekend cartoon slots, especially around holidays like Halloween. </p><p>Which is to say that I never got a Boo Bucket growing up but was made to feel like everyone else in the world had. So it was an obvious stroke of genius when the company decided to bring the nostalgia-bait merchandise back with the original look and style in 2022. Millennial parents who were stressed to the max and looking to post an easy W with their kids could get 15 minutes of quiet and fill the gap in their own childhood with one quick trip <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-failure-tiktok-1851548668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-failure-tiktok-1851548668">to the (non-AI) drive-thru</a></span>. It was a nice dream while it lasted. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur's Gate 3 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>He said he tried to impress upon his staffers that they should not be afraid to fail. In fact, it's essential to stumble in the creative process, he said.</p><p>"It's OK to fail--failure has always been in the DNA of the studio; failing is part of creativity, and we have to remember that," he said. "I'm happy that we're out of the circus now and we can focus on what we're doing."</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he hopes Larian's next game can be "something you would be proud to show your friends, and something that you would want to play."</p><p>"That's the core. If that's there, we'll be fine," he said. "These are very talented and skilled people, so if you give them freedom and trust them to do their best, you can't go wrong."</p><p>Larian has bold ambitions for its future projects, and the company's next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">codenamed Excalibur</a>. It sounds like it's still very early days, as Vincke said earlier this year that the team is still "trying to figure out what the hell it is."</p><p>What <em>is </em>confirmed is that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">not making Baldur's Gate 4 next.</a> "We want to do big, new things. We don't want to rehash the thing that we've done already," Vincke said earlier this year.</p><p>Given the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3, the series is likely to continue with a different developer. Hasbro, which owns the IP, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">hopes to release Baldur's Gate 4 by 2050.</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-best-characters-are-now-dungeons-dragons-miniatures/1100-6526851/" data-ref-id="1100-6526851">Baldur's Gate 3's Best Characters Are Now Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures, Out Next Year</a></li></ul>

Blizzard has clarified how players can access Vessel of Hatred, and there is one answer: <strong>B</strong><strong>uy it</strong>.</p><p>Vessel of Hatred is a $40 expansion to the game, and purchasing it outright is the only way to access it at launch. Game Pass subscribers can, however, save $4 via Game Pass Ultimate, knocking the price down to $36.</p>

            <p>
Throne and Liberty - the latest South Korean free-to-play fantasy MMO to get a western release courtesy of Amazon Games - is off to a strong start this week, hovering near the top of Steam's concurrent charts (albeit still behind that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banana-clicking-game-now-9th-most-popular-of-all-time-on-steam-knocks-baldurs-gate-3-out-of-top-10">infernal Banana game</a>) despite mixed reviews.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Throne and Liberty - which promises exploration and "massive-scale combat" for "thousands of players at once" across a "dynamic" open world - is Steam's sixth most played game, with 251K concurrent players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2429640/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. That puts it just behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Banana, PUBG, and perennial Steam favourites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's a strong start for Throne and Liberty, but its early launch week peak of 326,377 concurrent players pales in comparison to Amazon's other previous releases. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, for instance, managed an all-time high of 1.3m concurrents at launch in 2022, while New World saw a peak concurrent of 914k players when it arrived in 2021. The key, of course, will be maintaining player interest in Throne and Liberty, which both Lost Ark and New World in particular have struggled to do - despite the latter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-mmo-new-worlds-aeternum-overhaul-is-having-an-open-beta-next-month">recent relaunch as New World: Aerturnum</a>.

<p>
Throne and Liberty's arrival hasn't been without incident either. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429640/THRONE_AND_LIBERTY/#app_reviews_hash">currently rated Mixed on Steam</a>, with players dinging it for a whole range of issues - from almost inevitable launch week servers woes to more fundamental complaints, including shallow gameplay design. Steam Deck and Linux players have also been frustrated by the arrival of Easy Anti-Cheat, rendering Throne and Liberty unplayable on those systems - albeit seemingly temporarily, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/throne-and-libertys-steam-deck-anti-cheat-malady-seems-cured-for-now">Rock Paper Shotgun reporting</a> the issue now seems resolved.
</p><p>
All the above only applies to Steam, of course; but if Throne and Liberty has a similar impact on consoles (it's also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 with cross-play supported) Amazon will no doubt be wanting to shout about it soon.
</p>
<p>
Throne and Liberty, perhaps surprisingly given how much corporations love the old brand synergy stuff, isn't one of the games being immortalised in Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level anthology series</a> - although the company's New World: Aeternum does make an appearance, alongside the likes of Mega Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, Pac-Man, Spelunky, and, er, Concord.

In an Instagram post, the Superman and Witcher star praised the developers at Saber for the action game set in Games Workshop’s grimdark universe, although revealed he failed to complete the campaign solo on the Angel of Death difficulty, which is the hardest of the four difficulties available.</p><p>As we can see from the photo above, Cavill was smart enough to paste over his username with the word “nope.” Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you’d never know it.</p><p>Riffing on this in their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/93-september-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a> to toxic Space Marine 2 players, Saber and Focus said you never know who you might be insulting in-game — it could even be Henry Cavill himself.</p><p>“Be loyal to the cause, be respectful,” reads the statement. “It has been reported that some players were displaying hurtful behaviors or comments in-game. We do not tolerate that and will take action to prevent it. </p><p>“First and foremost, we kindly ask you to remain respectful, mature and mannerly with your fellow Space Marines. You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be... overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are... It could even be 😏... you don’t want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don’t.”</p><p>Whether this warning acts as a deterrent or perhaps <em>encourages</em> toxic behavior from players who think they might be playing with or against Cavill remains to be seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Elsewhere, Focus revealed the hotly anticipated new PvE Operations map coming to Space Marine 2 as part of Season 2. It’s located on one of the existing planets, Kadaku, and sees the Space Marines once again fight against the Tyranids. The new Operation arrives in October. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>​The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory.</blockquote><blockquote>The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/02/capillary-towers-1727882783773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tyranid Capillary Towers in Space Marine 2's upcoming new Operation.</figcaption></figure></output><p>And finally, Focus said a hotfix will arrive "very soon" that is aimed at fixing crashes and improving stability. In the future, players can expect more quality-of-life improvements, additional customization features (such as new colors for the lenses), and, for PC players, a 4K texture pack released for free. There’s also work being done to address ongoing server issues.</p><p>Saber recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-30-adds-pc-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more"><u>Space Marine 2’s game-changing patch 3.0</u></a>, which made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-patch-30-made-a-seemingly-innocuous-change-to-the-games-ending-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-losing-their-minds"><u>a seemingly innocuous change to the game’s ending that got Warhammer 40,000 fans excited</u></a>.

He revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-will-hopefully-automatically-make-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-performance-mode-look-better-than-quality-mode-does-now-dev-says"><u>the boost he expects the PS5 Pro will give Space Marine 2</u></a>, discussed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the studio</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-is-so-protective-of-warhammer-40000-it-told-the-space-marine-2-dev-they-got-the-ankle-armor-wrong">how protective Games Workshop is over the Warhammer 40,000 brand</a>.</p><p>Season 2 runs from October until the end of 2024 and includes the aforementioned new Operations map, a new enemy, a harder difficulty level, a new weapon, and various other improvements.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The next game from Larian Studios could be at least four-to-five years away. When speaking during the SEA Game Awards, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke said that the next game from the company should be expected sometime in 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>He then said afterwards that people shouldn’t hold them to that timeline or date.</p>



<p>“I knew you’d pick up on that. It was just a joke,” he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> after accepting a Special Recognition Award a the event. “I don’t know, we’ll release it when it’s ready. They’re big games and it takes time, so don’t hold us to a date.”</p>



<p>As far as what that next game will be, that’s up in the air. It’s known that Larian Studios isn’t working on another Baldur’s Gate title after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completing work</a> on Baldur’s Gate 3. That said, the studio is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/">working on multiple games</a> right now. At least one of those games will be a brand new IP from the company.</p>



<p>“As an independent studio since 1996, we value the freedom to follow our creativity wherever it leads,” they said at the time. The studio has said that it is leaving Dungeons and Dragons “entirely”. However, it is still currently providing support to Baldur’s Gate 3 via a small team within the company.</p>



<p>When do you think the next game from Larian Studios will come? Join in the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/660/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> ends with a bit of a cliffhanger. Though Lilith is defeated and Sanctuary saved for a time, another threat, Mephisto, still looms. Seeking to put an end to the Lord of Hatred once and for all, Neyrelle traps Mephisto's essence within a Soulstone before disappearing, leaving only a cryptic note as to her intentions. Enter Vessel of Hatred, Blizzard's first expansion for Diablo 4 releasing on October 8, where players will race to find and help Neyrelle in her struggle before it's too late.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of Vessel of Hatred and alongside the debut of a new in-game cinematic highlighting the physical and mental toll Mephisto's presence has taken on Neyrelle, we got the chance to chat with game director Brent Gibson and associate narrative designer Eleni Rivera-Colon about Vessel of Hatred's cast of characters. How is Mephisto's influence affecting Neyrelle? What is Mephisto's goal, and what is he able to do while trapped within the Soulstone? What is Lorath up to? Gibson and Rivera-Colon wouldn't spoil anything but did help set the table as to what players can expect to see as they journey through Vessel of Hatred's story campaign.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred - In-Game Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In Vessel of Hatred, Neyrelle is seeking the Vault of Light, a location said to be hidden within the dense jungle of Nahantu and supposedly the final resting place of Akarat, the founder of the Zakarum faith. It's there she hopes to be able to destroy Mephisto for good, but his presence within the Soulstone corrupts the world around her, catching the attention of the Spiritborn, the guardians of Nahantu's jungles.</p><p dir="ltr">After teaming up with a new character, the wise Spiritborn elder Eru, players finally catch up to Neyrelle in the newly revealed cinematic. Soulstone in hand, she furiously recites ancient chants in an effort to control Mephisto's power. Gibson said the scene is the moment the player character is "coming to terms" with the scale of Neyrelle's situation and realizing that something must be done as she struggles to tame Mephisto.</p><p dir="ltr">"She's doing everything she can with chants to hold him in the Soulstone," Rivera-Colon said. "He's essentially trying to break out. He's going to do everything he can."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961" data-ratio="0.56226209896683" data-width="1839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961"></a><figcaption>Players will team up with a new character, the Spiritborn elder Eru, in their hunt for Neyrelle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neyrelle believed that by accepting the burden of the Soulstone alone, she would be keeping her friends safe. Taking on heavy burdens and being forced to deal with situations out of her control is something that Neyrelle as a character is used to, Rivera-Colon said.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the expansion we get to really explore what she thinks about this choice and this decision now that she's been with something like Mephisto and [the] Soulstone for so long," Rivera-Colon said. "It's going to take a heavy, heavy toll on her, and this is something she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to do."</p><p dir="ltr">As much as it's a story about Neyrelle, it's also one about Mephisto, too. Absent in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, he played a supporting role in the story of Diablo 4, aiding players anonymously in his Bloodied Wolf form on their quest to stop Lilith before eventually revealing his true identity. Gibson said one of the goals of the expansion was to hone in on the Lord of Hatred and tell the next major chapter of his story, teasing that there is "still more to come" in regards to Mephisto that Blizzard will craft over time.</p><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is one of the Prime Evils, and though he is terrifying in his own way, he's quite different compared to the demon from which the series derives its name, Diablo. Mephisto is more keen to sow hatred and division among the people of Sanctuary, finding vulnerabilities in people and turning friends and family against one another for his own nefarious purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's his MO," Gibson said. "If you think about the way he shows up in the base game, making you second guess your allies, making you second guess Lilith. What kind of influence does he have on Neyrelle right now? What is he making her second guess?"</p><p dir="ltr">Though he is still trapped in the Soulstone, his wolf projection seen in the base game returns, once again serving as Mephisto's voice and a way for him to "spread his message." His corruption seeps from the Soulstone into the world around it, with Gibson describing the Soulstone itself as being almost radioactive in nature.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a pretty big deal that Mephisto is back on Sanctuary," Gibson said. "Any time that happens, they get banished back to the abyss and have to kick and scream all the way back. Even though he's stuck in the Soulstone, the danger here is if he gets out, he's physically back on Sanctuary, and so it's important Neyrelle finds a solution to not let that happen."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959" data-ratio="0.56254272043746" data-width="1463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959"></a><figcaption>Mephisto was defeated in Diablo 2 but is finally back on Sanctuary (albeit still inside Neyrelle's Soulstone).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is trying to do everything in his power to break free, though his options are limited and so he must be careful, Rivera-Colon said. Thankfully for Mephisto, the expansion returns him to one of his old seats of power, the jungles of Nahantu where he previously corrupted the Zakarum church and battled players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>. Gibson said that Vessel of Hatred is "revisiting history" in that way, but it's clear that Vessel of Hatred is also expanding on the region and its lore, adding new wrinkles to the story of Akarat, the Zakarum, the Light, and the Spirit Realm.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Zakarum faith didn't get everything right," Rivera-Colon said. "They didn't know Akarat. So it's an opportunity to explore Akarat and Akarat's faith not just through the Zakarum faith but through the land and the impact he had on the land throughout Nehantu."</p><p dir="ltr">There's no doubt the focus of Vessel of Hatred is on Mephisto and Neyrelle. However, one of Diablo 4's main characters, the last Horadrim, Lorath, is notably absent. Gibson said that was by design, as they only had so much room for the stories they could tell in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">"Where Lorath is is a mystery," Gibson said. "That will unpack over time, but if you think about the state of the world after the base game, he had some work to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is still leaving plenty of details for players to discover come launch day, though a recent trailer may have already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-trailer-may-have-spoiled-its-final-boss/1100-6526669/">spoiled one of the expansion's boss fights</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-optimization/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is hard at work on optimizing the game and making sure that the experience will be as good as possible.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Italian outlet <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/monster-hunter-wilds-intervistata-tgs-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a>, the game producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, designer Kaname Fujioka, and director Yuya Tokuda talked about optimization, saying that, while they cannot provide more details on the matter as of now, they hard at work on it to make sure the whole experience will be optimized in the best possible way. Seeing as there have been considerable improvements in terms of performance in the Tokyo Game Show 2024 build over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom one</a>, there's no doubt the team is already doing great work on this front.</p>
<p>In the new interview, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team also commented on cross-play and cross-save functionality, confirming that cross-play can be disabled at any time, even when searching for available quests, so hunters will have plenty of freedom in matchmaking to tailor the experience. Cross-save, on the other hand, is very difficult to implement in a game like this, but the team feels the issue is alleviated somewhat by the simultaneous release on PC and consoles, giving players the ability to pick their preferred platform and still be able to play with everyone else.</p>
<p>Speaking about online play, the Monster Hunter Wilds team also confirmed that some of the trademark social elements of the series will be back, and better than ever before, in the new entry in the series. When connected to an online lobby, for example, every player inside the lobby will appear in the base camp, so the new open-world setting isn't going to impact this aspect of the series negatively. Additionally, it will be possible to start a quest in different weather conditions thanks to a sort of weather forecast system that will let players choose a weather condition and let the hunter rest until the chosen time.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will also see a major change regarding balancing that will likely lead to more build variety. Offensive skills have been moved to weapons, thus giving players way more freedom with armor pieces. Additionally, the decorations system was changed to allow for a more flexible customization system.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 29th, 2025.</p>

<p>Deletion has been suspended effective from today at 1:08am Pacific time (that's around 4am Eastern), and the suspension counts for every world in the Aether, Crystal, Dynamis, and Primal data centers.</p>

<p>Square Enix says that it will "monitor the situation in the coming days" and announce when auto-demolition will begin again once a decision has been made. We don't know when that will be just yet, though.</p>
<p>When it does happen, the auto-demolition timer will continue from where it left off when it was paused, so you'll have exactly as much time to deletion as you did before the pause happened.</p>
<p>The studio closes by saying it hopes that "recovery is swift" for those affected by Hurricane Helene, and that those affected "will be able to rejoin us in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>soon".</p>

<p>Back in the mid-to-late 2000s, Blizzard started work on a project known as Titan. The game was set to be another MMORPG from the company behind World of Warcraft (WoW), but take place in a completely new and original setting. </p>



<p>There have been a few stories about the game’s development, the problems behind the scenes, and it’s ultimate cancellation. But many of it had been hearsay </p>



<p>Now, thanks to Jason Schreier’s new book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, we have more of the story as to what happened with the project. Ahead of the book’s October 8th release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon posted details from a section</a> of the book that dives head first into Titan and its development problems.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-engine/">Blizzard’s Survival Game Was Cancelled Because of Engine Issues</a></h6>



<p>According to the book, Blizzard didn’t want to wait for another game to come and be a “WoW killer”. Instead, the intended to create another MMO to do it themselves but keep players within the same ecosystem. There had been talks of doing something like a World of StarCraft game, but the internal belief was that StarCraft could fit into an MMORPG setting. </p>



<p>The decision was to then try something new.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-team-started-small-at-blizzard">Titan Team Started Small At Blizzard</h2>



<p>Led by Blizzard vice president Rob Pardo, the team working on Titan started as a “small team of top developers” with an eventual goal to bring in the best developers, artists, and others over to the project. After a couple of years in development, it was being viewed as an “all-star team” being built.</p>



<p>The game was set on an alternate version of Earth in 2070 and was said to be “two games in one.”</p>



<p>“[P]layers [take] control of superhero-like characters who lived normal lives during the day and secretly battled against evil forces at night,” the Polygon story reads from the book. “An early presentation showed the player, as a professional chef, popping a dish into the oven before going off on a secret mission. When they returned, the dish was perfectly cooked and ready to serve.”</p>



<h2 id="h-playtests-had-concerns">Playtests Had Concerns</h2>



<p>As the game started playtesting, the game was “fun in isolation” but finding the core gameplay loop was something that just never found footing. The game’s combat had superhero classes with unique abilities but the continued engagement of players was a struggle to for the Titan team. There were also issues with the technology built specifically for Titan causing issues with the game’s development causing lag when use or problems that caused development to pause altogether.</p>



<p>It also didn’t help that Riot Games was hiring developers from the project over to work on League of Legends, which was in development at the time and released in 2009.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/">New StarCraft Shooter In Development At Blizzard</a></h6>



<p>Regarding the design of the game, it was said that things would regularly change or be moved in entirely different directions. There were also issues with a bloated art repository with artists working on something without realizing or being informed that it had already been completed in the past. </p>



<h2 id="h-finger-pointing-from-titan-developers-to-blizzard-leadership">Finger Pointing From Titan Developers To Blizzard Leadership</h2>



<p>As the struggles during development continued, developers on Titan ultimately pointed the blame at Pardo. They stated that he was viewed as an “absentee game director” due to him also overseeing StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3 at the time. It left him little time to lead the brand new IP.</p>



<p>Pardo, according to developers, would come in and out during the project’s development. When he would show up and get involved, it would often lead to months of work being thrown out after he wasn’t around for long periods of time.. The development team became demoralized as Pardo would shoot down ideas for the game without offering reasons or guidance of where the team should go next.</p>



<p>In 2013, it was then announced internally that the game was going to be rebooted before it was cancelled in 2014. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-costly-endeavour-for-blizzard">A Costly Endeavour For Blizzard</h2>



<p>After the cancellation of Titan by Blizzard, Pardo appeared to blame others for the game’s failing rather than taking accountability, according to the book. His actions throughout the development and beyond led to a loss of trust from other management at Blizzard. This had a number of executives and directors demanding Pardo’s removal from a position of leadership. Pardo took a sabbatical from the company after Titan was ended. He never returned as Pardo resigned from Blizzard at the behest of then-CEO Mike Morhaime.</p>



<p>Overall, development of the cancelled Titan project cost Blizzard roughly $80 million. However, rather than lose everything that was done, the company was able to repurpose various elements of the game into what would become Overwatch.</p>

                <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a> got their wish for a follow-up game during Sony's most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>. The next title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost Of Yotei</a>, is moving ahead with a new protagonist and a different setting. While there's still a lot to be revealed about the game, the creative team behind Ghost Of Yotei wants players to know that this spiritual sequel won't be as repetitive as the original title. </p><p>"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," creative director Jason Connell told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p><p>Part of those unique experiences will involve the player exercising more control over the choices made by the game's heroine, Atsu. Although the story is set centuries after Ghost of Tsushima, Atsu has assumed the Ghost persona as her own. Players will also get to decide how Atsu fights her battles, with the option of using traditional melee weapons or switching to firearms. </p><p>Nate Fox, the game's other creative director, shared his desire to introduce a greater sense of danger to Ghost of Yotei that was inspired from Sucker Punch's location scouting at Shiretoko National Park.</p><p>"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," recalled Fox. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying... We strive to bring that into the video game--that feeling of danger."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei doesn't have a release date, but it will arrive on PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <p>I wasn't very well yesterday, and to make myself feel better I took to the internet to see what joys I could find tucked away in some corner or another. What I ended up finding was rather unexpected, but all the same very welcome.</p>
<p>You see, I came across a trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game, an upcoming release from Bit Bot Media and Metal X Entertainment. And I think it looks kind of great, thanks to retro graphics and 8-bit chiptune renditions of The Rocky Horror Show's soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>The game is described as a "bonkers classic platformer", which will allow players to relive the "strange journey of Brad and Janet like never before". You can check out the announcement trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game below.</p>

<p>While the blurb has The Rocky Horror Video Game release date simply listed as "coming soon", according to the trailer itself it is set to arrive this month. So, something for Halloween.</p>
<p>The Rocky Horror Video Game is set to release across PC via Steam (although it doesn't appear to have a Steam page as yet), Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>So, do you think the first thing players will be asked to do when booting up the game is "Jump to the left"? I certainly hope so!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260296/microsoft-xbox-research-developers-outreach<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft wants to hear from game developers who might be skipping Xbox or those already building games using the company’s developer tools. The software maker is expanding its Xbox Research team to include the community of game developers, seeking feedback directly from developers about tools, support, and the overall pain points of the Xbox platform.</p><p>A new program, much like Microsoft’s Xbox Insider one, <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/resources/xbox-research/">is now open</a> to all members of game studios, not just technical employees. “Typically, it takes a lot of people to make and ship a game, including marketing, user research, artists, audio, PMs, community managers, and more,” <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/">says Deborah Hendersen, PhD</a>, principal user researcher for Xbox. “We want to hear from everyone who works on games or helps support game studios because if we can make your life easier, it makes gaming better.”</p><p>While the program will gather feedback about tools, performance tuning, debugging utilities, and plenty of other aspects of game development, it’s also designed for input from game studios that aren’t shipping games on Xbox. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why,” says Hendersen. “And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>Microsoft’s outreach for direct game developer feedback comes amid some noticeable delays for third-party releases on Xbox. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> launched on Xbox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993155/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-game-of-the-year">several months after</a> it first debuted on PS5, because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844418/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-series-x-s-cross-save-split-screen">technical issues</a> developing for the Xbox Series S. Capcom revealed last month that its two new fighting game collections —&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>&nbsp;— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234863/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-xbox-release-2025">will come to Xbox in 2025</a> after “technical discussions” with Microsoft.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is also coming to Xbox after its PS5 release, as its developers “are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.” Microsoft says “the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us,” and single-sourced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/29/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-an-exclusivity-deal/">reports</a> suggest there could be some kind of Sony exclusivity deal involved.</p><p>The developers of&nbsp;<em>Enotria: The Last Song </em>also publicly <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">announced an “indefinite delay”</a> to the Xbox version of the game last month, after struggling with Microsoft’s game review process. The studio’s statement about the issues <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1831359412897976811">caught the attention</a> of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who reached out to the team to help resolve the situation.</p><p>Microsoft would obviously prefer to receive this type of feedback from game developers privately, to avoid potential headlines about game developers skipping the platform due to technical issues, tooling, or even processes. Hopefully, this expansion of Xbox Research will help address the pain points that prevent some game developers from releasing Xbox games.</p><div>
