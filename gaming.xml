The page hinted at a console with a “7-inch or 8-inch display,” an HDMI port, and dual fans — things the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a> lacks — before it was apparently removed.</p><p>You can still find the FAQ on The Internet Archive, where I found snapshots as far back as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504094510/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">May 4th, 2024</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240804194607/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">yesterday</a>. In addition to those details, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/the-lenovo-legion-go-pc-gaming-handheld-is-getting-a-smaller-s-model-and-we-now-have-more-details"><em>Windows Central </em>suggests</a> that the console will be named the Lenovo Legion Go “S,” not “Lite,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165835/what-will-the-lenovo-legion-go-lite-look-like">as has been rumored</a> until now. </p><p>The current version of the Legion Go features an 8.8-inch screen and a single fan and outputs video over USB-C. The FAQ only mentions dual fans, which led <em>Windows Central</em> to speculate that the slip represents an overall refresh for the system. Lenovo hasn’t announced these details, however, so do take this all with a grain of salt.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213086/plastic-apple-watch-se-3rd-generation-colors-kid-friendly"><h2>The plastic Apple Watch SE could be for kids, and that’s actually exciting</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool"><h2>OpenAI won’t watermark ChatGPT text because its users could get caught</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs"><h2>Intel is laying off over 15,000 employees and will stop ‘non-essential work’</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/3/24212291/game-informer-video-game-industry-mourns"><h2>The video game industry is mourning the loss of Game Informer</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212078/google-gemini-olympics-ad-backlash"><h2>Google pulls Gemini AI ad from Olympics after backlash</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-cute-throwback-rpg-super-dungeon-muncher-the-dungeon-is-being-eaten-by-a-monster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-soviet-horror-trinket-kletka-is-an-endless-descent-in-an-elevator-that-wants-to-eat-you%E2%80%9D">carnivorous post-Soviet elevators</a>, now it’s retro fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Much like our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-6">The Maw</a>, the Muncher is a creature that operates according to its own understanding of time and physics. You and all the creatures within each dungeon map are locked to a grid and take turns to move, as in, say, Shiren The Wanderer. The Muncher, however, exists in real time, reaching gluttonous hands out to grasp the map’s edges and drag everything into its gullet. It’s sort of like rewinding a video of a printer, except that printers have better table manners.</p>
<p>In addition to staying ahead of the Muncher's gnashing molars, you’ll need to perform such traditional RPG duties as buying new weapons and kit from swiftly-masticated shopkeepers, finding keys for locks, and destroying or circumventing obstacles such as trees or cracked blocks. Speed is of the essence, but it looks like you can also delay or even deter your ravenous nemesis by feeding it less tasty things like toilets.</p>
<p>Super Dungeon Muncher is out today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095800/SUPER_Dungeon_Muncher/">Steam</a> and eventually <a href="https://itch.io/profile/n-nexy">Itch.io</a> and Google Play.

After dozens of hours of dealing with ugly fused weapons and broken gear, you finally get the sword of legend. But it’s still far from perfect. While it can’t break, it can lose its power and have to recharge. The Master Sword from the game’s opening prologue doesn’t have that same weakness, though, and players have spent months trying to find a way to get that version instead. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That Master Sword is called MsgNotFound and players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567">previoulsy found a way to bring it out of the confines</a></span> of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s prologue by breaking the game with glitches shortly after it launched. Nintendo patched that method out months later, however, and diehard fans have been trying to get it back ever since.

It’s not an easy process and it requires deploying dozens of glitches, but the end result is a Master Sword that you can swing as many times as you want without it ever losing its power. </p><p>The video is by El Duende 05 and is broken into seven parts that go through each step and glitch performed in detail. The road to recovering MsgNotFound was a group effort though, with special credit to user NghtmaR3 among others whose new SLD (Save Load Dupe) exploit is the step that breaks the seal Nintendo tried to put around all of these shenanigans. The whole thing feels like one of those old History Channel documentaries of archeologists trying to recreate the building of the pyramids. </p><p>Like I said, the current method is very long, requires an intricate stacking of game-logic-defying bugs, and is easy to mess up. Doing so will either force you to start over early on in the process or potentially nuke your end-game save, since one of the key things going on here is transporting the MsgNotFound Master Sword from one file to another. One phase revolves around stacking auto saves. Another has you fall through the bottom of the world. It’s almost like players are time traveling into the past and ripping the item out of its reality and taking it back with them between separate files. It’s one of the wildest things I’ve ever seen people try to pull off in a game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-recommend-id="image://e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Link falls through the world.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s how El Duende 05 describes the final steps in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> glitch jargon: “Transfer both a shield and weapon to prologue to unlock those inventories 2) Place a portacull shield in position near Ganon 3) Set up LSW next to the map origin 4) Cull Link while lifting an object 5) Navigate between dimensions with no abilities to arrive at Ganon in the prologue 6) Send the sword back to your future self.” Or you can reference the entire written guide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>.<br></p><p>This complex method works for 1.2.1, the current version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> which Nintendo graciously hasn’t patched since last August. Some players simply never updated their game and got the MsgNotFound Master Sword using the old method. Others are waiting for a more streamlined version of the latest method to be discovered before giving it a go themselves.  El Duende 05 said they expect one will be found soon enough. Hopefully, that happens before Nintendo decides to drop a new update out of the blue. We all deserve an unbreakable Master Sword in our lives. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA has just released a new deep-dive video for FC 25’s Ultimate Team game mode, detailing features such as Rush in Ultimate Team, FC IQ, expanded Evolutions community requests, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Ultimate Team Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcGJ4fe0iNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-5v5-rush-nbsp">5v5 Rush&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The developers first reveal the details about EA FC 25’s new game mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-details-new-game-mode-coming-to-ea-fc-25-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rush</a>, and how it will work in Ultimate Team. Players can join this 5v5 game mode either with 3 of their friends or through matchmaking. </li>



<li>Each team will have an AI goalkeeper, and players can choose one player from their Ultimate Team club to control them for the entirety of the match.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Winning matches earns you points, which can be used to acquire Ultimate Team rewards each week. </li>



<li>Additionally, there will be Rush events throughout the season, allowing players to fetch more rewards and use various types of players.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fc-iq-revamps-ultimate-team-tactics">FC IQ Revamps Ultimate Team Tactics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Through the improvements made towards Tactics, players have more control over how their team behaves on and off the ball in EA FC 25. Manager Items will now include Tactical Presets, so if a player wishes to apply Pep Guardiola’s tactics to their team, they can emulate that even better.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Additionally, players have more ways to apply their strategies with the addition of Player Roles, which replace Work Rates. Players can boost these roles through special items released throughout the year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-25-ultimate-team-evolutions-nbsp">EA FC 25 Ultimate Team Evolutions&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Many restrictions have been lifted from Evolutions so that players can use their favourite players more often. </li>



<li>Evolution cards have received cosmetic enhancements, too; players can now add backgrounds, borders, sounds and animations to their EA FC 25 Evolutions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>One of the community’s most requested features has arrived for EA FC 25’s Ultimate Team. There is now a storage space for the Untradeable Duplicates, which players can access through Squad Building Challenges.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Contracts have been removed for Players and Managers so they can keep playing for the club.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rivals have also received some revamps. A new point system allows players to progress even when drawing their matches. Also, Relegations are back, as the total number of checkpoints for each division is being reduced.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Live Friendlies will no longer matchmake according to your Rivals rank. Instead, it will use the form as a factor to matchmake.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lastly, there’s a new Ultimate Team stadium for players to customise.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>In other news, EA announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announced-earnings-of-1-26-billion-for-q1-of-fiscal-year-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings of $1.262 billion</a> for the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-gameplay-five-minute-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released a new video for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, showing off the world and gameplay of the first mainline series game to feature a playable Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming out for Nintendo Switch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">26th September 2024</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Traversing Hyrule Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With a focus on exploring this latest iteration of Hyrule and how Zelda can get around with her new summoning abilities, the video takes us to the searing heat of Gerudo Desert, and the village of Gerudo tribe, and the Jabul Waters, which plays host to both the Sea Zora and River Zora, who don’t always get along. Kakariko Village is at the base of Eldin Volcano, but this has been transformed by the weird rifts that kicked this adventure into gear, and you’ll have to figure out how to reach the home of the Gorons. And finally, the Faron Wetlands are all kinds of leafy and play home to the Deku.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom will throw plenty of side quests your way, such as tryiing to held an elderly man cheer up his wife with a flying plant, save someone from being trapped up a wall, gathering up Cuccos, and dealing with a… a Tornado Ghost?</p>
<p>You’ll be able to zip around the world using Waypoints as fast travel nodes on the map, but Zelda will also be able to ride a horse and hop up and over obstacles. All you need is to learn the Carrot echo and you’ll be able to summon a horse wherever you are.</p>

<p>Smoothies take the cooking of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and blend them into something a bit lighter, as you can combine gathered items to make smoothie combos. Electro Apple mixed with Floral Nectar, for example. You can also use outfits and accessories to enhance Zelda’s abilities, like Zora flippers improving her swimming.</p>
<p>Another ability was also revealed, in addition to the Echo summoning. For larger obstacles, Tri will help you with the power of Bind. This latches any object to Zelda’s movement, from a huge boulder to a half-buried chest, and even to summoned echoes, if you want to have an impromptu spiky shield. You can also reverse bond to map Zelda’s movement to other creatures and objects, switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the Link’s Awakening remake, which was a real highlight from a few years ago, which was already rather delightful, but will make for a real change in the series by having Zelda be the main playable character, using magical abilities and her wits, as opposed to combat in order to get ahead.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-fairy-tail-games-take-on-deckbuilding-and-volleyball-soon.944997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kodansha Creators' Lab has announced two brand new&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>games in collaboration with series creator Hiro Mashima, and they're both landing in the next month or two.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the collaboration between the two began when Mashima "said he wanted to have a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>game made". Presumably, he's not counting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fairy-tail">RPG created by&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>developer Gust</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a deckbuilding roguelite that will feature five playable characters from the manga, each of whom will have their own special abilities. It'll tell an original story and will revolve around exploring dungeons, building synergies, and taking advantage of your characters' unique strengths.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=b2ArHRao 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=tn0CrtG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a new roguelite heading your way later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on PC via Steam on August 26th,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is developed by ginolabo, the team behind&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/soulvars-review-biblical-demon-antivirus"><em>Soulvars</em></a>&nbsp;(which is also a deckbuilding RPG, so this appointment makes a lot of sense).</p>
<p>The second project to come from Mashima and the Kodansha Creators' Lab is&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a rather unique-looking pixel art proposition that marries beach volleyball with fighting game mechanics.</p>
<p>You'll be playing volleyball as (and against) teams of&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters, and each time you score a point, your magical abilities will become more powerful, granting you access to more spells with greater power.</p>
<p><em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>will support up to four players, and you'll be able to play either in local multiplayer or via Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>This one's taking a little longer to cook; it'll launch on September 16th.&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>is being developed by tiny cactus studio, whose work you may know from&nbsp;<em>Super Glitter Rush&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dimension Tripper Neptune: Top Nep</em>.</p>
<p>To commemorate the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>-themed art contest is also being held, so if you fancy drawing&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters in beach attire, you can <a href="https://daysneo.com/award/fairytailbeachvolleyball.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the contest and its rules out here</a> (although it's in Japanese, it looks like it's open to anyone).</p>
<p><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305500/FAIRY_TAIL_DUNGEONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on August 26th, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116680/FAIRY_TAIL_Beach_Volleyball_Havoc/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Beach Volleyball Havoc</a>&nbsp;</em>follows not long after on September 16th.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero developer S-Game says that as it believes in "making our game accessible to everyone", it has not "ruled out any platforms".</p>
<p>Confirmation came via the studio itself, which took to social media to clarify its stance after several media outlets reported an unnamed developer <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/">said</a> "nobody needs Xbox".</p>

<p>S-Game has distanced itself from the comments, saying they do not represent "S-Game's values or culture".</p>

<p>"We want to clarify that these claimed statements do not represent S-Game’s values or culture, as we believe in making our game accessible to everyone and have not ruled out any platforms for Phantom Blade Zero.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-revamped-part-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One, if not the most popular, mini-game seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be revamped for the third and final part of the trilogy, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/neo_aoshi/status/1819841781204156672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819841781204156672%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@neo_aoshi</a>, during a panel at the Otacon anime convention with producers and voice actors from the game, director Naoki Hamaguchi talked about the Queen's Blood mini-game, revealing that he has received many requests from fans regarding a real-life version of the card game. While he couldn't confirm one would be coming, he did reveal that a revamped version of the mini-game will be included in the third and final entry in the series.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series is no stranger to card mini-games like Triple Triad from the eighth entry in the series and Tetra Master from the ninth entry in the series, so the inclusion of Queen's Blood in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was extremely welcome, although it wasn't possible to challenge the vast majority of NPCs like it was possible in Final Fantasy VIII. Hopefully, the revamped version of the mini-game will allow players to play more games against a bigger number of opponents than Rebirth.</p>
<p>The wealth of mini-games is only one of the things that defines the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth experience. You can learn more about the second entry in the series, currently available exclusively on PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

<p>The intro video elaborates that fans can also expect “behind the scenes footage” and documentary-style content. </p>



<p>Wilson also teases that Swen Vincke, founder and CEO of Larian Studios, will also make cameo appearances from time to time. </p>



<p>Vincke often interacts directly with fans. In March 2024, they also made it very clear that Larian is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not planning any Baldur’s Gate 3 DLC</a> or a sequel. Though fans are disappointed, many praised the open communication.</p>



<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1820480224766963996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Vincke also teased Larian Studio’s new YouTube channel. They mentioned some of the glimpses seen in the intro video. That includes “loads and loads of fun” from smashing ice sculptures to “game celebrities catching fire.”</p>



<p>Although Larian Studios is working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new games</a>, moving beyond Baldur’s Gate 3, fans still await its major Patch 7 update. Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-been-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed</a> the closed beta for Patch 7, originally expected in late July 2024. </p>

            <p>God of War studio Sony Santa Monica is developing its first new IP in over 20 years.</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/">ResetEra</a>, a developer at Sony Santa Monica mentioned they've been working at the studio "looking after the entire character development pipeline on their new IP".</p>

<p>In the "about" section of their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glaucolonghi/">LinkedIn profile</a>, a developer supervising character development said they were "thrilled to be back" at Santa Monica after a brief departure to work at Striking Distance and Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as character supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline, on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing characters in video games together," the developer said.</p>
<p>As you no doubt expect, the dev stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the IP is or even what kind of characters they were developing</p>
<p>The studio's debut game was PS2 racer Kinetica in 2001, but since the first God of War in 2005 Sony Santa Monica's worked solely on that series (besides assisting development on other projects). A brand new franchise, then, is an intriguing prospect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-launches-new-official-figurine-collection-with-aloy-varl-kratos-atreus-and-jin-sakai">Sony recently revealed a new range of figurines called "The Shapes Collection"</a> that includes characters from God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with toy company Spin Master, Sony says the "highly detailed figures deliver the interactive storytelling element of these titles in an all-new way, extending the gaming experience from digital to physical".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might be a brand-new adventure, but the upcoming game brings back some well-known areas for fans to explore. A new trailer for the Switch exclusive shows off familiar spots like Gerudo Desert, Kakariko Village, and Hyrule Castle.</p><p dir="ltr">Focused on exploring Hyrule, the new Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom video highlights some of the major regions in the game. Gerudo Desert is "prone to frequent sandstorms," for instance, though there is an oasis where the princess can get some rest by creating a bed echo. There's also Kakariko Village within the Eldin Volcano area, a town that dates back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on SNES.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DolGuwvAnfg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One intriguing plot point touched on in the new trailer is a conflict happening in Jabul Waters between the Sea Zora and River Zora tribes. Both groups seem friendly to Zelda, but not each other. Meanwhile, Deku scrubs can be found in the Faron Wetlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo noted that traversing the map in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be made easier in two major ways. First off, waypoints are littered across the land, allowing for fast-travel by warping. Then, the princess can call horses by creating a carrot echo to ride across Hyrule. The steads can even trample over enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda won't just have horses to help her, either. The Bind ability seems integral to her adventure, letting the princess move massive objects while she runs around. This can also be used to pull treasures out of the ground or even reposition foes (maybe off of cliffs). Additionally, there's a reverse bond for Zelda to be transported by moving objects.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, there are smoothie shops across Hyrule. Zelda can blend together different ingredients to create scrumptious drinks for her own benefit, such as replenishing hearts with a Mixed Milk Smoothie.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-starring-zelda-launches-september-26/1100-6524358/" data-ref-id="1100-6524358">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced</a> not even two months ago at a Nintendo Direct. It will be the first mainline game in the franchise with Zelda as the protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-features-a-playable-link-according-to-esrb-rating/1100-6524962/" data-ref-id="1100-6524962">though an ESRB rating has mentioned Link is playable</a>.

Nintendo has released a new trailer highlighting some of the new powers she’ll have and all the places she’ll get to use them. </p><p>Princess Zelda will have the whole of Hyrule to explore in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. She’ll traverse the harsh landscape of the Gerudo Desert, the calming waters of Jabul, the jungles of the Faron Wetlands, and the scorching lava floes of Eldin Volcano. And to get around the wide world of Hyrule, Zelda will be able to summon a trusty steed to her side, just like Link.</p><p>Zelda’s got a couple of new powers that will aid her in her quest to save Hyrule from dangerous rifts that threaten to consume the land. In addition to being able to summon copies of creatures or objects called echoes, she’ll also be able to bind or reverse bond objects. With the bind power, Zelda will tie an object to her movement, letting her move giant obstacles or enemies out of her way. For reverse bond, Zelda herself will move along with the object, helping her get over big gaps or climb tall cliffs.</p><p>It’s a little more than a month before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out for Nintendo Switch owners.

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-starts-filming-in-october-matthew-lillard-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesRadar</a>, film actor Matthew Lillard gave fans a major update during a new interview, teasing that filming on the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie could begin in October 2024.</p>



<p>Lillard appeared on YouTube channel JayBee &amp; Milly for an interview, and briefly spoke about his availability. He stated that he’s doing a TV show right now and “doing FNAF in October.” </p>



<p>In the first film adaptation, Matthew Lillard portrayed William Afton. Five Nights at Freddy’s earned the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-opening-weekend-is-the-biggest-for-a-live-action-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest opening weekend</a> for a live-action video game adaptation. So, Blumhouse naturally greenlit a 2025 release window for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in May 2024. </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/FNAF_ScottGames/status/1820217342489735365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, FNAF_ScottGames also revealed a production image for the anticipated sequel. The post has fans speculating on the character under construction.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans identify the character as Toy Bonnie, opening the door for a lot of potential story beats. Toy Bonnie remains a fan favorite character, who originally appeared in the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 video game. </p>



<p>The toy animatronics are beloved characters, and they are tied to crucial elements of the larger mythology. It’s unclear if Toy Bonnie and corresponding characters will appear in flashbacks, given the game series timeline.</p>



<p>The original Five Nights at Freddy’s movie did include a lot of fan service. However, it still took many creative liberties. </p>



<p>The update teasing Toy Bonnie shows a lot of progress on Five Nights at Freddy’s 2. Actor Josh Hutcherson previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-story-is-already-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story was in development</a> back in January 2024. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it's showing off the game's version of the timeless land of Hyrule, as well as how you can get around it.</p>
<p>Titled "A Tour of Hyrule", the trailer describes&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s world as "a land of plentiful abundance" in which you'll discover "diverse regions" filled with "interesting people".</p>
<p>First, we get to see the iconic Gerudo Desert, which has made an appearance in several&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games including <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time"><i>Ocarina of Time</i></a>,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, and, most recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. It returns here, complete with a town where you'll meet members of the Gerudo tribe.</p>

<p>Eldin Volcano and Kakariko Village are also making a return, and naturally, Eldin is where you'll find the Gorons, as well as their favorite treat in the form of rock roast.</p>
<p>The final new area we're introduced to is the Faron Wetlands, a swampy area that is home to the Deku Scrubs, who are rumored to have a "voracious sweet tooth", according to the trailer. As you can see, you'll be well-served if you're hoping to spot classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>staples in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Following the new areas, we're then introduced to&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s quest log, which works similarly to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>'s, as well as its travel waypoints, which are fast travel points you can revisit once you've discovered them.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a horse, which you can use to hop over small walls and send smaller enemies flying. You'll be able to summon it from anywhere in the overworld.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">launching next month</a>, then you should check out the trailer in full. It also touches on new abilities, items you can equip, and the crafting-adjacent smoothie system, plus more.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>arrives <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Echoes-of-Wisdom-2590490.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on September 26th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom continues to look brilliant in this latest trailer from Nintendo that gives you a whistlestop tour of its version of Hyrule. 
</p>
<p>
From Hyrule Castle to Gerudo Desert and Kakariko Village, the upcoming Switch game will let Zelda see all the sights, plus hang out with Gorons, Deku Scrubs and both flavours of Zora. 
</p>
<p>
As well as fast travel points, Zelda will also be able to explore on horseback to hop over small echoes. Just create a carrot "echo" - using your ability to conjur up objects you've seen previously - and your trusty steed will come running.

<p>
Other sections of the trailer gave a look at other new powers, such as Bind - the ability to make objects or enemies move as you do. It's handy for moving boulders, or even monsters, right off of cliffs. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, Reverse Bond lets you attach yourself to moving objects, including animals such as flying gulls or wall-climbing spiders, to explore further.
</p>
<p>
Cooking also appears to be present - of a kind - although here you'll be making smoothies. Business-orientated Deku Scrubs will let you blend ingredients you've collected for helpful boosts - such as giving resistance to elemental effects or recharging hearts.
</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creatures-of-ava-review-mystery-of-avatar-with-song-in-its-step<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> was a game that I went into expecting some fun animal collecting and puzzle solving, For the most part, that's what I got, but one major aspect of the game that I didn't expect to come away from was a shift in perspective about conservation, Climate Change, and how we always view it from human-kinds eyes.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> puts you in the shoes of Vic, an employee of the Aleph corporation, whose mission on the dying planet of Ava is to research the lifeforms that inhabit it, capture some to save them from the planet's destruction, and investigate the hostile 'Wither' that is infecting all life.</p>
<p>Early on in your adventure you meet Nim'ar, a member of the Naam race, who is investigating the ancient sites of Ava looking for information on how to stop the 'Wither' from continuing to take over the planet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=fMjbQJJw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=r4m9DkMn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nim'ar is one of the Naam, a race that is able to hear the songs of the creatures and the planet itself</figcaption></figure><h2>Save The Creatures, Save Ava</h2>
<p>Through your journey, you won't just be working to preserve the flora and fauna of Ava from the Wither, but you'll also be investigating ancient ruins for Nim'ar. If you're already roaming the planet looking for different species, it can't hurt to also follow up on some leads of how it may have been combatted in the past.</p>
<p>As soon as I set foot on the planet of Ava my mind was drawn to parallels with the <em>Avatar </em>film franchise. Not only in the creation of a fantastical world filled with unique flora and fauna but also in the Naam race and the way they're a part of a hive mind with all other creatures and Ava itself.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting approach to the story, that Ava arriving had the best intentions but we are just humans showing up declaring that we'll save everyone without really understanding the problem or asking those on the planet if they even want to be saved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=LXgpKjqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=moRQzx9n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vic isn't just investigating ancient ruins, but also the ruins that her own company has left behind</figcaption></figure><p>As the story was building I as the player was feeling at odds with the job that I was there to perform on behalf of the company, and how much of a 'savior' complex our character has. As more was learned about Ava I definitely could see how Vic's thinking was shifting, but even then the turns that the story takes I couldn't have predicted. They left me feeling quite humbled as a human in the presence of nature.</p>
<h2>Explore Four Biomes</h2>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> has Vic exploring each of the four areas of Ava. Within each, you'll be learning the song of the animals - as a way to tame and have them assist you in your exploration - seeking out new creatures to tame and transport back to your base, and exploring the ruins to help Nim'ar learn about how the ancient civilizations dealt with the Wither.</p>
<p>Whether you're following the primary quest line, hunting down any of the side-quests, or just exploring at your own pace you'll encounter countless little puzzles to tickle your brain with.</p>
<p>You might see an interesting item through some brambles. To reach that you'll first need to remove the Wither from a nearby beast, play its song to ingratiate it to you, and then use its ability to break away the bramble. As you get further into the game puzzles might require you to utilize the abilities of two or three creatures at a time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=IjhWXWqf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=UPwXDWCP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Raga has a variety of abilities that you can use to reach new areas</figcaption></figure><p>To cleanse the Wither from a creature you need to form a link to it with your ancient staff, once a connection has been made the creature's infection will slowly whittle down. You can use abilities to drain the infection faster, raise the creature into the air, or even slow the creature down to make the process easier. You can cleanse multiple creatures at a time by creating a beam chain between them all.</p>
<p>While you're cleansing the creatures you have to be careful as they will fight back. They could charge at you, blast you with shockwaves, or dig up from under your feet. You'll need to be watching everyone's movements and dodging accordingly while maintaining your connection.</p>
<p>Cleansing feels like the gameplay of the poltergust of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a328c3b-49f3-48a6-9879-9ac7c3863b9d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/luigis-mansion-3-review"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> but with a lot more going on than just 'don't break the chain'. For each combat scenario, you'll need to be balanced making a steady pace toward your objective, cleansing the creature, while also dodging left and right, and watching out for your ability cooldowns. At no point would I say that the process was difficult but enjoyably challenging.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-13.jpg?itok=3a_3eVgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-13.jpg?itok=xQSdxB7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your beam has been established it's a game of avoiding taking damage</figcaption></figure><h2>Relaxing Exploration Of Ava</h2>
<p>Reaching a new area I always made it my goal to just pick a direction and start exploring. Whether I found new creatures to pet or take photos of, upgrades for Vic, or the main plot I was having not only a wonderful but a relaxing time.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel pressured to progress the story, and the world never felt so large or daunting that I wasn't happy to explore every inch of it. This might be one of the most relaxing games I've ever played because of it.</p>
<p>Each new area you travel to is also sizably smaller than the one before, meaning that as the story reaches its natural crescendo your progress isn't stopped because you still have 1/4 of the game to get through. I felt my time and attention was respected in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=A3U3RsrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=queYZUoF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While I appreciate a clear 'point of no return' I would much rather not be locked out of half of the game</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> that did frustrate me as someone who enjoys collecting in games, but also in making story progress is the number of "point of no returns" that are present in the game. Starting with the second biome once you're done with the story quest of that area you lose access to it.</p>
<p>Because of this, at any point in time, you only ever have access to two out of the game's four areas. You'll be presented with a helpful 'point of no return' screen, but it also felt like I was being shamed by the game for wanting to progress the story while I hadn't taken a photo of all of the wind chimes in the area.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to think that in a game that has so many fun puzzles stashed away in its world, you can lock yourself out of half of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=icPwHy0A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=NQaEre5r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through your adventure, Vic will see Ava in a very different way</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Creatures of Ava</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is going to be one of those games that sit with me for a long time. While completing the story and scouring the world might not promote replayability, especially with how much of the game you lose access to as you play, the message of the game is one I'm going to continue to muse on.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> shows a beautiful world on the verge of death, and while science is trying to protect and preserve it, starts to ask big questions about how we understand and interact with nature from a very specific human point of view.</p>
<p>The gameplay was relaxing and rewarding, with so many interesting nooks and crannies of the world to explore. I also enjoyed that <em>Creatures of Ava</em> never overstayed its welcome. It arrived, politely shared with me an interesting story about a strange and fantastical world, and then left leaving me with delightful things to ponder.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Creatures of Ava is a wonderful adventure that wraps together an interesting story about humankind's view of nature, exploration of a beautiful alien world, and interesting creature taming mechanics. While I'd wish to continue exploring this game a major detriment is how you get locked out of half the game as you play through it.
