			<p>Hell is Us is very focused on its puzzles and exploration gameplay, but there's also a fair amount of combat to deal with. Progression blockers are mostly linked to puzzle solving, but there are a few points in the game where Rogue Factor gives you a combat challenge to move through to the next major story beat, and it's in those instances where you'll want to be prepared.</p>



<p>There are several elements that can go into your combat loadout in Hell is Us, but only a few of them really make a difference. This guide will give you a breakdown of one of the best loadouts possible in the game to give you a dominating presence among the creatures that stalk Hadea.</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-guide-best-loadout-to-dominate-combat">Hell is Us Guide - Best Loadout to Dominate Combat</h2>



<h3 id="h-combat-basics">Combat Basics</h3>



<figure><figcaption>If you break an enemies stance, you get the chance to watch a finishing move.</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, a few basics about combat in Hell is Us. You have a few different weapons you can choose from, but they're not all made equal for the combat situations Hell is Us throws at you. You're more often than not facing multiple enemies. It's less common that you'll have to deal with only one Hollow creature at a time, and that's due to an elevated variant of enemies that have something called a Haze with them.</p>



<p>Haze's are based on four core emotions that the narrative and lore in Hell is Us focuses on: Rage, Grief, Ecstasy, and Terror. They're color-coded, and there are different tiers of Haze enemies to face, though you won't know what tier you're facing until it appears.</p>



<p>Because of Hollow enemies with Haze, you'll constantly be fighting multiple enemies at once. You have to defeat the Haze before you can damage the Hollow, and each will move independently, so you can be focusing on the Haze, only to be attacked from behind by the Hollow. That's why you'll want to have weapons and abilities that help you crowd-control situations more than anything.</p>



<p>You can block attacks by holding the block button, but parrying is far more effective, and has the chance to break your enemies' stance and perform a killing blow. You have a stamina bar of your own along with your health bar, but part of the trick to Hell is Us is the fact that the less health you have, the less stamina you have available. Keeping both up is paramount to survival.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Haze's have their own attack patterns you'll have to learn in order to defend yourself against them. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>Regarding your weapons, you have a few different weapons to choose from, each of which can be altered by one of the four core emotions. Altering the weapons based on the different emotions locks the weapon into only being able to use abilities tied to that specific emotion, and alters its visual appearance. So when you find a pair of Twin Axes, and you make them Terror Twin Axes, their appearance will change, and you'll only be able to attach Terror-based abilities to them.</p>



<p>The four different weapons you can choose from are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sword</li>



<li>Greatsword</li>



<li>Polearm</li>



<li>Twin Axes </li>
</ul>



<p>Each of them can be made into Rage, Grief, Ecstasy, and Terror variants. You can also use them in their neutral forms if you want to, though that's not exactly recommended.</p>



<h3 id="h-loadout-basics">Loadout Basics</h3>



<p>Your loadout in Hell is Us is comprised of five parts: your weapons, of which you can have two equipped at any time. Your defensive gear, which, to be entirely fair, has little impact on combat. Your relics, a passive and an active one, the abilities (called Glyphs) tied to your weapons, and your Drone's abilities (called Modules).</p>



<p>Those are all the parts you can modify, besides what items you can have equipped at any time. A lot of those item slots might be filled with key items for your investigation and exploration, so I won't be going into what items you should have equipped, except to say that it's a good idea to have Lymbic Batteries and Medkits on you for tricky situations.</p>



<p>Lymbic Batteries refill the gauge that lets you use your weapons' abilities, and Medkits heal you without having to use the Healing Pulse mechanic. There are other consumables that can be helpful, but none are more significant than the batteries and medkits.</p>



<p>You can equip one passive relic and one active relic at a time, and two defensive gear items at a time. Each weapon can have three abilities attached to it that are mapped to your D-pad, combined with a press of the left trigger, with the fourth space saved for your active relic, which will be available to you no matter what weapon you have equipped. You can also have four different abilities equipped to your Drone, which, like your abilities on the D-pad, are equipped to face buttons plus a press of your right trigger.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-loadout-to-dominate-combat">The Loadout to Dominate Combat</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Hell is Us loadout screen. </figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, this loadout won't exactly be available to you immediately from the beginning of Hell is Us, but you'll be able to build up to it, and there are elements of it you can build early on, like focusing on levelling up the Twin Axes you'll find early in the game.</p>



<p>All weapons are levelled up through a combination of experience points gained through use (or a consumable called a Tuning Stone to fast-track levelling), and increasing their Grade at the Blacksmith in Jova, which is the first major city you'll visit.</p>



<p>Here's everything you'll need for the loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li>Weapons: Twin Axes of Terror, Polearm of Rage
<ul>
<li>Twin Axes Abilities: Frightful Ambush, Feed on Fear, Recoil</li>



<li>Rage Polearm Abilities: Rage Spike, Berserk, Animosity</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Drone Abilities
<ul>
<li>Distract</li>



<li>Whirlwind</li>



<li>Surge Step</li>



<li>Death from Above</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Active Relic: Aster's Band of Domination</li>



<li>Passive Relic: Mark of the Betrayed</li>



<li>Defensive Gear: Bracers of Rage, Bracelet of Ecstasy</li>
</ul>



<p>Below are explanations of every element of it, and why they each make a significant part of the loadout that'll have you dominating combat in Hell is Us:</p>



<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: </p>



<ul>
<li>Polearm of Rage</li>



<li>Twin Axes of Terror</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Twin Axes of Terror in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Twin Axes are the fastest weapon in the game, making them ideal for parrying attacks. You'll find a pair of Twin Axes in the very first area of the game, and while they won't do as much damage per hit as the sword you start with, their speed outweighs that disadvantage, especially when you can increase their damage through levelling.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Polearm of Rage in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Polearm, for anyone who has played Dark Souls or Elden Ring, is similar to a Halberd in that it can be used like a spear, but also gives you a wide horizontal range of attack, letting you damage multiple enemies in front of you at once. It has a faster parry timing than the Greatsword and more range than the standard Sword, while also still being capable of heavy attacks. All of this is what makes it a top choice, along with the Twin Axes. Between both weapons, you're covering your needs for crowd-control, agility, and strong attacks to deal huge damage in a single blow. You'll also find a Polearm early on, in the second area you visit in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Rage Polearm Abilities:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rage Spike
<ul>
<li>This lets you fire a lance that shoots out of your Polearm at enemies, and is one of the few abilities that lets you attack from a range. The lance will also explode on impact for extra damage. You'll find the first level of this Glyph by closing the Timeloop in Acasa Marshes. You'll find the top-level 'Elite' version of it in the Marastan Vault of Forbidden Knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Berserk
<ul>
<li>This Glyph will put you in a state of rage that keeps you from being stunned, staggered, or knocked back for 40 seconds, and is a great way to keep the pressure on your enemies. You'll find the base version of it in Vitalis' secret office. You'll find its Elite variant by closing a Timeloop in Jeljin.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Animosity
<ul>
<li>This chain's enemies to you and pulls them in closer in melee range, while also stunning them in the process. You find the base level of this Glyph in the Sendra Forest Vault of Forbidden Knowledge. You'll find the Elite version of it by closing the Timeloop in Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Terror Twin Axes Abilities:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Frightful Ambush
<ul>
<li>Another area-of-affect ability, creating a pool of damage around you that damages your enemies and has the added bonus of stunning them. You'll find the base version of this Glyph by solving the Blood Queen’s Story Room mystery. You'll find the Elite version of it in the Marastan Vault of Forbidden Knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Feed on Fear
<ul>
<li>This links you to a targeted enemy and lets you drain their health to heal yourself from range, and is another one of the limited ranged attacks available in Hell is Us. You'll find the base version of this Glyph in the Senedra Forest Vault of Forbidden Knowledge. You'll find the Elite version of it by closing a Timeloop in Auriga Museum. </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Recoil
<ul>
<li>Makes you jump backwards and stun enemies near you. Again, another solid crowd controlling method that keeps you in control of the flow of combat encounters. You'll find the base version of this Glyph in Vitalis' secret office. You'll find its Elite version by closing a Timeloop in Marastan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Active Relic:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Aster's Band of Domination Active Relic in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Aster's Band of Domination
<ul>
<li>This stuns all nearby enemies for 10 seconds, and is one of the more useful active relics purely because it has the shortest cooldown of only 3 minutes, whereas most others take 9 minutes to recharge. You'll find this relic in the Vyssa Hills Vault of Forbidden Knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Passive Relic:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Mark of the Betrayed Passive Relic in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Mark of the Betrayed
<ul>
<li>This is the key to the whole build, because it absolutely changes the way you'll play the whole game. With this in your loadout, you'll deal 200% damage for the next 10 seconds. If you can chain link successful parries, then you'll take almost everything down in three to four strikes. You'll find this Relic by closing a Timeloop in Acasa Marshes.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Alt: The Blood of the Phelange
<ul>
<li>I mention this because it is also effective, but the barrier to activating it is a bit more of a fence to hop over. You increase the damage dealt with each attack after every kill by 25% for 30 seconds, though, of course, it's easier to hit a successful parry and keep your damage output up than having to wait for a kill, especially when you will have the odd time where it's just one major enemy in front of you, making this passive ineffective. Consider it an alt, but Mark of the Betrayed is what you should use. You'll find this Relic by closing a Timeloop in Vyssa Hills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Drone Abilities:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Distract Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Distract
<ul>
<li>This is the first ability or 'Module' you'll get for your drone in Hell is Us, and it's effective the whole game. With crowd-control being such a big part of combat, being able to take at least one enemy off the board by distracting them and keeping them stunned until you attack that specific enemy. You get the base version of this Module almost immediately after you fight your first Hollow in the game. You'll find the Elite version of it by completing the Locked Computer mystery in the Research Department of the Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Whirlwind Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Whirlwind
<ul>
<li>This ability spins you around really fast and lets you hold out your arms and attack enemies around you, which is a tactic that covers plenty of ground, either with the Twin Axes or the Polearm. You'll find the base version of this Module just ahead of the tunnel you enter to check out the ON convoy in Acasa Marshes. You'll find the Elite version of this it in the OMSIF training area's supply room in Auriga Museum. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Surge Step Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Surge Step
<ul>
<li>This ability is like having an extended dash, as the drone will pick you up and almost throw you out of the way of an oncoming attack. You'll find the base version of this Module on a fallen ON agent in Jova, near the Blacksmith shop in the Acasa Marshes area. You'll find its Elite variant in the Drone workshop in the Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Death from Above Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Death From Above
<ul>
<li>This one is another which is what it sounds like. It's a ground-pound for those who first learned about slamming attacks from platformers. The drone picks you up, and you do a strong attack slamming into the ground, dealing a large chunk of damage to enemies. You'll find the base version of this Module near Agatha's body in Vyssa Hills. You'll find the Elite variant of it in a OMSIF crate in Marastan in the backyard of a house on the path to the Deimos Division camp. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Defensive Gear:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Bracers of Rage in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Bracers of Rage
<ul>
<li>This gives you some health back with each hit you deal against an enemy. You'll find them by completing the Aster’s Safehouse secret. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Bracelet of Ecstasy in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Bracelet of Ecstasy
<ul>
<li>All of your attacks take less stamina to perform, a helpful trick to have up your sleeve, considering how stamina and health are tied. You get this by solving the Caddel's Brothers Treasure mystery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond swapping out the base versions of these Glyphs and Modules for the stronger ones, it should go without saying that to improve your damage output, you should be levelling up your weapons. But these are the bones of what gives you the best loadout in the game to help you absolutely dominate combat encounters in Hell is Us. Plenty of these pieces can be found in the game's early hours as well, so you'll have the full game to turn it into the powerhouse it evolves into by the end of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet more industry layoffs have been announced, and this time, it's the turn of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Midnight Suns&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis Games to let some of its staff members go.</p>

<p>Said layoffs were confirmed by Firaxis' parent company 2K to the folks at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>. Of course, 2K describes the staff cuts as the studio "restructur[ing] and optimiz[ing] its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity".</p>

<p>Naturally, 2K stopped short of confirming just how many staff members were laid off, but Game Developer, citing "sources close to the situation", says that "dozens of people" have been let go in this layoff wave.</p>

Despite that, however, Zelnick expressed faith in the game, suggesting it had high "lifetime value".</p>

<p><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>was released in February this year, and upon its debut, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with a mixed reception</a> from players, who cited a poor user interface and significant gameplay changes compared to previous franchise installments as their reasons for leaving negative reviews.</p>

<p>Firaxis subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game</a> and to implement updates based on player feedback, but despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-update-110-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">some significant patches</a> arriving since&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>'s launch, it seems this wasn't enough to save these Firaxis employees from the chopping block.</p>

<p>These layoffs aren't even the first that 2K has put into effect this year. Last month, it was reported that&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>studio Cloud Chamber <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">had run into difficulties</a> regarding the upcoming&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>, with&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>producer Rod Fergusson subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-rod-fergusson" rel="nofollow">confirming his appointment at the studio</a> (as well as layoffs).</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-called-the-msi-claw-an-embarrassment-so-imagine-my-surprise-its-successor-is-the-best-windows-handheld-yet.1289805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">no one should buy</a> MSI and Intel’s original handheld gaming PC. I literally called it an embarrassment, and the company blacklisted me after that. MSI stopped pitching me news, and stopped answering my emails, even after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">began to write off its dud of a handheld</a>.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find: MSI and Intel have gone from worst to nearly first. In many games, it’s <em>twice</em> as fast as the original Claw. And with new drivers that bump its performance up to 30 percent higher since launch — I tested — the newer $1,000 <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Claw-Gaming-Handheld-Thunderbolt/dp/B0DLPYC184?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> might just be the best Windows handheld you can buy.</p><p>The Claw 8 has become a fixture in my life as I carve and puzzle through the hauntingly beautiful painted worlds of <em>Clair Obscur:</em> <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Blue Prince</em>, respectively. I have a lot of other handheld review units floating around, but I rarely want to reach for a different one.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Let’s get this out of the way<strong>: </strong>it’s called the “AI Plus” because this “AI Engine” is supposed to automatically configure performance using Intel’s NPU. But it’s very dumb in practice and not a reason to buy.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Yes, it runs Windows, and if you’ve read any of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">my handheld reviews</a> you’ll know how I feel about that. Windows 11 has become a bloated mess filled with annoying upsells and unwanted AI cruft, is annoying to navigate by controller alone, and often wakes up poorly from sleep. I can’t count the number of times I’ve sworn at Windows handhelds for popping awake in the middle of the night, or spontaneously deciding it was time to turn their remaining battery life into hot exhaust in the middle of my sealed backpack.</p><p>But the MSI Claw 8, with Intel’s Lunar Lake, isn’t as bad as the Windows norm. When you combine that with the newly improved performance, the longest battery life of any handheld in all but the most lightweight games, and an excellent 8-inch screen, it’s enough to knock <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X off its high perch</a> — at least until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">the Xbox version</a> arrives this October.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->999</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Best battery life in a handheld</li><li>Excellent performance after updates</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Fewer Windows annoyances than usual</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>$1,000</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Iffy rumble for games</li><li>AI tuning feature doesn’t work well</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus is the biggest mainstream handheld, at nearly a foot long, 5 inches tall, and an inch thick, and it’s the only current-gen handheld with an Intel chip. Last year, both size and Intel pedigree were liabilities — but thankfully every handheld maker is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial#:~:text=Handheld%20ergonomics%20was%20one%20bright%20spot%20going%20into%202025.">paying more attention to ergonomics</a> this year, and Intel’s Lunar Lake is a big improvement.</p><p>Scalloped grips and balanced weight distribution make the Claw comfortable for me to hold, it no longer looks like a ROG Ally knockoff, and while it isn’t light at 1.75 pounds (795g), that’s only a quarter-pound heavier than the Ally X. That’s despite the Claw having an extra inch of diagonal screen real estate and the same 80 watt-hour battery capacity as Asus.</p><div id=":Rkbcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw is wider, taller, and roughly as grippy as the Asus ROG Ally X…</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And it’s bigger and grippier than the Lenovo Legion Go S, which also has an 8-inch screen.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I honestly found it tough to go back to playing <em>Expedition 33</em> on the Asus ROG Ally X after using the Claw 8, partially because its screen is more colorful and more spacious (with a far smaller bezel), and partially because the game ran smoother. (I beat the game, including the entire Endless Tower and four of the game’s toughest boss fights, on the Claw 8.)</p><p>But before all that, I had to tangle with Windows 11 — and was surprised how little detangling was needed.</p><p>The first time I fired up the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, I couldn’t believe how fast Windows setup had become. Instead of the typical 45 minutes of annoying upsells and mandatory updates, I was able to get to the Windows desktop just seven minutes after I pressed the power button.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>MSI’s “Quick Settings” are now part of the Xbox Game Bar in Windows.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s still slower than setting up a SteamOS handheld, but fast enough I thought there must be some mistake! (Did this really get past Microsoft certification?) Another curiosity: When I hit the button that pulls up the Claw’s quick settings menu to adjust brightness, volume, and my processor’s TDP (giving it more wattage/gas), it launched a new widget in the Xbox Game Bar with those handy controls instead of a dedicated MSI process! Did somebody accidentally slip me a preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">of Microsoft’s “best of Xbox and Windows together”</a> that’ll ship on the Xbox Ally later this year?</p><p>But I won’t lie and say the Windows experience was flawless after that. MSI’s Game Bar widget turned out to be incredibly sluggish and unreliable out of the box. It got better after I changed the Windows power mode from “Balanced” to “Best Performance,” but it still isn’t nearly as fast as Asus’ Armory Crate, which has gotten extremely responsive since the Ally first launched, or as reliable as SteamOS, which doesn’t require a separate utility at all.</p><div><h2>Here’s how much MSI has improved:</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus (Aug ’25)</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus (Jun ’25)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 3-mo improvement</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain (August)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain (June)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 7 (Meteor Lake, Jun ’24)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 Lunar Lake vs. Claw 7 Meteor Lake</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>49</td><td>34.69%</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>59</td><td>32.20%</td><td>25.5W (~3.1h)</td><td>29W (~2.8h)</td><td>33</td><td>136.36%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>69</td><td>21.74%</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>53</td><td>58.49%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>79</td><td>7.59%</td><td>38W (~2.1h)</td><td>39.5W (~2h)</td><td>54</td><td>57.41%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>86</td><td>83</td><td>3.61%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>59.26%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>48</td><td>6.25%</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>57</td><td>5.26%</td><td>25W (~3.2h)</td><td>26W (~3.1h)</td><td>32</td><td>87.50%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>65</td><td>9.23%</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>49</td><td>44.90%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>72</td><td>5.56%</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>41</td><td>85.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>77</td><td>79</td><td>-2.53%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>49</td><td>57.14%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>66</td><td>19.70%</td><td>22.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>81</td><td>14.81%</td><td>29.5W (~2.7h)</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>45</td><td>106.67%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>91</td><td>15.38%</td><td>31W (~2.6h)</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>49</td><td>114.29%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>100</td><td>14.00%</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>48</td><td>137.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>119</td><td>107</td><td>11.21%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>58</td><td>105.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>33.33%</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>36</td><td>33.33%</td><td>26.5W (~3h)</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>29</td><td>65.52%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>41</td><td>26.83%</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>38</td><td>36.84%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>43</td><td>25.58%</td><td>42.5W (~1.9h)</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>39</td><td>38.46%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>56</td><td>44</td><td>27.27%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>37</td><td>51.35%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>51</td><td>7.84%</td><td>21W (~3.8h)</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>60</td><td>10.00%</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>32</td><td>106.25%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>68</td><td>7.35%</td><td>35W (~2.3h)</td><td>35.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>38</td><td>92.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>74</td><td>9.46%</td><td>42W (~1.9h)</td><td>41W (~2h)</td><td>39</td><td>107.69%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>81</td><td>75</td><td>8.00%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>42</td><td>92.86%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>0.00%</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>24.5W (~3.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>37</td><td>0.00%</td><td>28W (~2.9h)</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>41</td><td>2.44%</td><td>34.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>42</td><td>4.76%</td><td>40W (~2h)</td><td>39W (~2.1h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>46</td><td>45</td><td>2.22%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting. </em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>And no, I can never, ever trust the Claw 8’s power button to keep it asleep. I always have to explicitly put the system into hibernation mode instead, which is thankfully the first option in that Game Bar widget. (Microsoft really needs to get out of its own way and let manufacturers set the power button to hibernate instead of Modern Standby.)</p><p>It’s also a little frustrating to go back to a world where I have to manually download the latest Intel graphics drivers because they never showed up in MSI Center’s updates tab. But once I installed those new graphics drivers and learned to avoid the power button, I was rewarded with some of the highest performance and the best battery life I’ve seen from a handheld yet. It’s just better at the whole turbo mode thing, with higher frame rates and higher TDP options than the Ally X with Windows, and it’s more power-efficient than the SteamOS Lenovo Legion Go S, even if Lenovo’s Steam handheld got higher frame rates in half my benchmarks.</p><div><h2>Claw 8 vs. Ally X vs. Legion Go S vs. Steam Deck performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 fps</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Windows, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (SteamOS, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED fps</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Ally X</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Legion Go S</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Deck</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>57</td><td>26.92%</td><td>0.00%</td><td>15.79%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>71</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>9.86%</td><td>-7.14%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>80</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>5.00%</td><td>-8.70%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>89</td><td>96</td><td>N/A</td><td>-4.49%</td><td>-11.46%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>86</td><td>89</td><td>92</td><td>57</td><td>-3.37%</td><td>-6.52%</td><td>50.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>41</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>24.39%</td><td>-10.53%</td><td>2.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>59</td><td>73</td><td>N/A</td><td>1.69%</td><td>-17.81%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>65</td><td>79</td><td>N/A</td><td>9.23%</td><td>-10.13%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>71</td><td>82</td><td>N/A</td><td>7.04%</td><td>-7.32%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>77</td><td>71</td><td>86</td><td>50</td><td>8.45%</td><td>-10.47%</td><td>54.00%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>59</td><td>74</td><td>61</td><td>33.90%</td><td>6.76%</td><td>29.51%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>84</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>10.71%</td><td>1.09%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>91</td><td>99</td><td>N/A</td><td>15.38%</td><td>6.06%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>93</td><td>100</td><td>N/A</td><td>22.58%</td><td>14.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>119</td><td>93</td><td>102</td><td>61</td><td>27.96%</td><td>16.67%</td><td>95.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>31</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>29.03%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>60.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>20.00%</td><td>60.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>43</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td><td>20.93%</td><td>62.50%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>46</td><td>33</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.39%</td><td>63.64%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>56</td><td>46</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>21.74%</td><td>64.71%</td><td>124.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>57</td><td>5.77%</td><td>-11.29%</td><td>-3.51%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>65</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>1.54%</td><td>-20.48%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>70</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>4.29%</td><td>-17.98%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>76</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>6.58%</td><td>-12.90%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>81</td><td>76</td><td>96</td><td>57</td><td>6.58%</td><td>-15.63%</td><td>42.11%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>28</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>10.71%</td><td>-16.22%</td><td>-6.06%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>30</td><td>47</td><td>N/A</td><td>23.33%</td><td>-21.28%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>28</td><td>50</td><td>N/A</td><td>50.00%</td><td>-16.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>34</td><td>52</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.41%</td><td>-15.38%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>46</td><td>34</td><td>55</td><td>33</td><td>35.29%</td><td>-16.36%</td><td>39.39%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>We’re not talking about a step change in performance here: this pricy $1,000 handheld still doesn’t have near the frame rate of a similarly priced gaming laptop. It’s just enough extra power to make games feel smooth on this handheld that were borderline choppy on its peers, like <em>Expedition 33</em> (even then, these handhelds need AI upscaling to get there).</p><p>But I <em>didn’t</em> have to sacrifice battery life to get that extra power. I often even push the Claw 8’s chip to 30 watts, a power mode that the Asus ROG Ally X doesn’t offer unless plugged in, for an extra frame rate advantage — while getting roughly the same battery life as the Ally X gets at its 25W unplugged maximum.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>MSI Claw 8 vs. Asus ROG Ally X ports and width.</em> <em>The Claw still has handy raised dots on each port to find them by feel.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And though the Steam Deck has long reigned as the efficiency champ, I found the Claw 8 can even beat the Steam Deck on both performance <em>and</em> power use when set to the same 15-watt TDP, often draining its battery 2 or even 3 watts slower. When you combine that with its big 80-watt-hour pack, it handily beat competitors in my <em>Dirt Rally</em> drain test, lasting nearly 19 minutes longer than the Asus ROG Ally X with Bazzite, 28 minutes longer than the Steam Deck OLED, and 80 minutes longer than the Legion Go S with SteamOS and AMD’s Z1 Extreme chip.</p><p>Below, you can see how battery life might compare at each performance tier. For example: the Claw 8 and Legion Go S with SteamOS both offer the same 66 frames per second when you offer their chips 15 watts of electricity, but you’ll probably get 3.9 hours of battery from the Claw versus 2.3 hours from the Legion. That’s because MSI’s Intel chip is drawing less power from a larger battery.</p><div><h2>Battery life vs. performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 fps</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Windows, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Ally X battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (SteamOS, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED fps</h3></th><th><h3>Deck battery drain</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>52</td><td>24W (~3.3h)</td><td>66</td><td>24W (~2.3h)</td><td>57</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>25.5W (~3.1h)</td><td>71</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>84</td><td>30.5W (~1.8h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>80</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>92</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>38W (~2.1h)</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>96</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>41</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>57</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>50</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>25W (~3.2h)</td><td>59</td><td>29W (~2.7h)</td><td>73</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>65</td><td>35W (~2.2h)</td><td>79</td><td>38W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>71</td><td>N/A</td><td>82</td><td>44.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>22.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>59</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>74</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>61</td><td>22W (~2.2h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>29.5W (~2.7h)</td><td>84</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>92</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>31W (~2.6h)</td><td>91</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>99</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>100</td><td>45W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>31</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>24</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>25</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>26.5W (~3h)</td><td>40</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>30</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>43</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>32</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>42.5W (~1.9h)</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>33</td><td>45.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>21W (~3.8h)</td><td>52</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>62</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>57</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>65</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>83</td><td>31.5W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>35W (~2.3h)</td><td>70</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>89</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>42W (~1.9h)</td><td>76</td><td>N/A</td><td>93</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>28</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>37</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>33</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>28W (~2.9h)</td><td>30</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>47</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>34.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>28</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>50</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>40W (~2h)</td><td>34</td><td>N/A</td><td>52</td><td>44W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>All this said, you still can’t ease off the gas <em>quite</em> like with AMD chips, at least not out of the box. Officially, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is a 17W–37W chip, and while MSI lets you set the chip’s TDP as low as 8 watts, I still saw the Claw empty my battery at a rate of at least 11W in<em> Balatro</em>, the magic poker game I use as my best-case-scenario test. That means at minimum screen brightness, with wireless off, I’m getting around seven hours max — whereas the Steam Deck OLED can get nine hours and the Asus ROG Ally X can manage 10 in such lightweight games.</p><p>I have some quibbles with the Claw’s hardware. Though the speakers are above average, the rumble is annoying and weak. Hall effect joysticks and dedicated gyro modes are nice, but aiming felt sloppy out of the box, like MSI didn’t bother tuning either to a console controller standard, and I still haven’t quite nailed it with tweaks in either individual game settings or MSI Center. It’s also not the fastest handheld to charge or download games, despite its two Thunderbolt 4 ports and Wi-Fi 7, though not slow either.</p><div><p>But the real hurdles for the Claw 8 are that $1,000 price — and that MSI might only have one more whole month atop the Windows heap. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility">Microsoft and Asus’ Xbox Ally is coming October 16th</a>, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a revamped OS</a>, and it could reshape the whole handheld market.</p></div><div><div><p id="handheld-power-explained"><h2><strong>Handheld power, explained</strong></h2></p></div><p>You might have noticed I write about two different kind of wattage measurements (W) in my handheld reviews: 1) the TDP of each handheld’s chip, which basically translates to how much power you’re letting it use, and 2) the handheld’s total battery drain.</p><p>That’s because of a sea change in how portable gaming works. Unlike traditional laptops, today’s handhelds let you <em>configure</em> their processor’s TDP at a moment’s notice, even while you’re in the middle of a game, to give you more oomph. But when you do that — or when a manufacturer sets a higher default TDP so their handheld seems faster out of the box — it’ll drain your battery faster.</p><p>How much faster? You can find the answers in my charts, along with estimates of how quickly your battery will go from 100 percent to zero if you choose that TDP in a given game. And make no mistake, some games won’t run well on a handheld unless you choose a high TDP.</p><p>But the battery drain wattage is <em>not</em> the same as TDP, because it doesn’t account for all the rest of the handheld’s systems, including its storage and screen, that each game might push differently. Frame rate per watt drained is what to look for if you care about battery.</p></div><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review]]></content:encoded>

Right now, the 1TB model is down 19% from $135 to just $110, the 2TB model is down 35% from $230 to $150, and the 4TB model is down from $405 to $280.</p>
<p>Creators were front of mind when Samsung developed this external solid state drive. It doesn’t matter if you are a photographer in need to backing up your pictures, a video editor managing a ton of projects and footage, or anyone else dealing with big files all day long — the T7 Shield can keep up with you. This SSD has fast read and write speeds. You’re getting up to 1,050 MB/s read speeds and up to 1,000 MB/s write speeds. That clocks in two times faster than the T5 from Samsung. It also happens to be nearly 10 times faster than an HDD would be. This means you’ll be able to move files between your work station and external drive quickly and easily.</p>

<p>For the videographers out there, the Samsung T7 Shield is an especially useful tool for your toolkit. This model lets you record in 4K at 60fps directly onto the drive, using a camera, smartphone, or tablet. It’s even compatible with the iPhone 15 Pro. No need to anxiously delete stuff from your camera roll before you can get the shot.</p>
<p>You have a choice of three different colors with the T7 Shield—pick between either black, beige, or blue. What I love about this is if you need to get multiple, just grab them in different colors. This way at a glance, you’ll quickly be able to remember which one is for what.</p>



<h2>Ruggedly Reliable</h2>
<p>As the name states, this is the Shield model of Samsung’s T7 SSD. It’s designed with a strong, rubberized exterior wrapped around a solid aluminum body. It’s got an IP65 rating, making it both water and dust resistant and it can even withstand a fall of 9.8 feet. Your data is well protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/">Right now, Amazon has the 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB models of the Samsung T7 Shield on sale for as much as 35% off.</a> Grab one before they go back up.</p>

			<p>Releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games on Game-Key Cards may be a forced choice for some developers due to raditional cartridges' technical limitations.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, Ubisoft Snowdrop Engine audio architect Rob Bantin provided some interesting insight on why a developer may choose to release a game on a Game Key Card, revealing that the Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target they were going for in the Star Wars Outlaws. The game is powered by the Snowdrop engine, which heavily relies on disk streaming for its open-world environments.</p>







<p>While this is a critical limitation, it shouldn't impact every Nintendo Switch 2 game moving forward. In a second message, the Snowdrop engine developer said that if a game is designed from the ground up for the system, the carts' performance limitations may not force a Game-Key card release, but as Star Wars Outlaws was built around the SSDs of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there was no choice but to release the game in Game-Key card format.</p>







<p>Judging from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws footage</a> released online so far, it seems like Ubisoft definitely made the right call, as even with some noticeable visual downgrades over the other versions of the game, the Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game is really solid, keeping a steady 30 FPS framerate even in open-world areas while also featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">ray-traced effects</a>. Now that the console is out and its specs widely known, hopefully more developers will be able to work around some of the cartridges' technical limitations and release more proper retail releases, which Nintendo Switch 2 owners seem to love, looking at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">sales data of games like Cyberpunk 2077</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game Key Cards have already stirred controversy among Nintendo fans, as they serve as a download-key holder rather than containing the full game on the cart. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">While they can be resold and aren’t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws looks like a respectable third-party game on the Switch 2, as gameplay footage of it so far has shown off a consistent 30fps performance. While it's naturally not as good-looking as the PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S versions, the fact that Ubisoft has managed to get the game running generally well on the Switch 2 bodes well for the system and potential upcoming releases from the company. In comparison, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">Elden Ring's Switch 2 performance isn't great at all</a>, according to reports.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launched for Switch 2 on September 4, a year after it was first released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game includes both of its DLC expansions--Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune--but the game might be a one-off considering that it wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/">Company CEO Yves Guillemot recently blamed the Star Wars brand</a> being in "choppy waters" as one of the reasons why the game didn't reach Ubisoft's sales expectations, although its worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">reviewers and fans criticized the game</a> for its badly paced intro mission and various technical issues when it first launched.</p><p>Most of these issues have been addressed since then, and the post-launch expansions have been well-received.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a27af05310361/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For those of you who managed to bag a Switch 2 on 5th June, you've had that big dock set up near the TV for exactly three months now. Are you tired of 'clacking' those Joy-Con into the system yet? Nope, us neither.</p>
<p>In that time, we've seen over 50 games come to the platform, large and small. While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/developers-reportedly-still-struggling-to-get-switch-2-dev-kits">some devs are still struggling</a> to get dev kits, other tiny outfits have managed to secure a Switch 2 release. Nintendo is keeping its hands tight on the eShop reins and being very particular in who it allows on the platform, it seems - presumably to prevent a deluge of titles that might distract from the platform holder's early offerings.</p>
<p>So, compared to its predecessor (which is still getting new games on a weekly basis, in amongst all the unspeakable slop), the rate of new releases is much slower. And the fact that many S2 games are reworked versions of old software or ports from other platforms means 100% new experiences have been thin on the ground. For multiplatform gamers who don't have a backlog to keep them busy, it's possible you'd look at the lineup of available Switch 2 games below and feel...disappointed.</p>

<p>Then again, it's hard to argue with the quality, old or otherwise! With several all-timers in there, there's plenty to play, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> definitely injects some much-needed 'brand new' into the library. (We're still working on our review, by the way - we'll have it with you as soon as we can.)</p>
<p>But what do you think of the Switch 2 library as it stands? Are there any gems in there which have flown under the radar and surprised you? Have all the big hitters landed for you? How would you rate the games in your collection so far?</p>
<p>Now that we've crossed the threshold of 50 games, we'll be publishing our reader-ranked list of the system's best games very soon, so take a look at the lineup below and feel free to rate any games you've played accordingly. (If you've rated any game previously, thank you! It will show up in red already, so no need to do so again - unless you wanted to revise your opinion, of course.)</p>

<p>And finally, let us know what you think of the overall software catalogue up to now by scoring the overall offering:</p>

<p>For our money? The library so far is an incredibly solid base to build on — and there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">some very exciting games coming</a>. With record-breaking console sales in a suboptimal economic environment, Switch 2 is doing very nicely after three months. There's work to do, but the future's bright in Nintendo Land, so here's to that!</p>
<p><em>Thanks for rating. Okay, back to Silksong with you.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/poll-three-months-in-how-would-you-rate-switch-2s-library-so-far]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of those fresh rides is a bridge layer, and you best believe it'll end up wedged somewhere improbable with its wheels spinning helplessly once I get my hands on it. How can you mess up motoring towards a gap, and pressing the 'commence bridgening' button? It'll be possible.</p>

<p>Alongside that bridge layer in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2104890/view/521974992851698336?l=english">Rebuild expansion</a>'s offerings are two new Central European maps. The first,  Contamination, is all about cleanup duty following a train crash dumping something not nice in a river thanks to some earthquaking. Then, there's Wash-Out, which as its name suggests is a rather wet venture into a "reclaimed wasteland" to get an oil processor up and running again.</p><p>Developers Saber Interactive have split 100 new missions between the two, many of which will likely amount to pick thing up or unfuck this please, as is the runner series' tradition. I'm a tad disappointed in the fact that aside from the all-new Vostok MU-97 'Ant' bridge layer, the other four extra vehicles are just revamped versions of rides from the base game. There's a bridge layer conversion for the Tayga dump truck, plus beefed up variants of the Thunder scout, Tuz 119 scout, and Mule T1 crane lorry.</p>
<p>That's it for the stuff included in the expansion, but there's also some free stuff on top of that, in the form of the Wayfarer ST7050 fuel truck and some advanced difficulty options. The latter includes "tougher fuel management, harsher convoy conditions, and stricter recovery rules, while adjusting costs and economy for a more demanding, realistic experience".</p>
<p>While these are features some players have been asking for since release, back when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/roadcraft-review-streamlined-building-biz-beset-by-bumbling-ai-bobs">I reviewed it</a> I quite liked the fact that it omitted some of the nitty gritty management you've got to juggle in a lot of these games. It was something that helped set the RoadCraft experience apart from its muddy siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game">Expeditions</a>, both of which are still getting fairly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1465360/view/543367091067028490?l=english">regular</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477340/view/541115291253342913?l=english">additions</a> for those who want an excuse to hop back into them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Brendy summed the RoadCrafting experience up thus in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roadcraft-review">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>RoadCraft is a podcast game, in the same vein as Truck Simulator or Elite: Dangerous. There's a big place for games like this in the world, sims that excel in delivering a specific kind of wonderful and comforting boredom. Slow tasks that act as a reassuring sedative in the manic whorl of life. But RoadCraft's start-and-go flow makes it a bumpier ride for me. I was falling asleep, but I never quite drifted off into its promised dreamland.</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see what he means about the constructadriving sim having a bit of a mixed-up ethos when it comes to taking it slow all of the time, or being able to speed along if you wish. As the Brendo also wrote, whether you enjoy RoadCraft'll likely depend on how much time you're willing to give it, especially when things go wrong.</p><p>If you've dug this sort of thing before and can clear the calendar, this Rebuild expansion looks a decent reason to fire it up. If only to see whether the bridge layer's as satisfying to use as the stump mulchers and tree harvesters.</p>

              <p>Happy Silksong Weekend to all who celebrate. If you’re not playing the most anticipated game of the decade right now, I can only imagine it’s because you don’t own any gaming console or PC to play it on. So, here! Let me help you. <strong>The Xbox Series S is a wonderful option for an entry-level game system and right now it happens to be on sale</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">It’s MSRP is $380, but for a limited time, you can grab one for 13% off at just $329.</a></p>
<p>Now for the elephant in the room… Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the latter of which was priced at just $300. A few months back, Microsoft made and announcement confirming plans to raise the price of its consoles and games. The Xbox Series S went up by $80 to $380. So while this discount brings console down lower than the current list price, this Series S is still $29 more than it had been for five years (ignoring any other discounts over that time). It stinks, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p>This model comes with a controller and hold 512GB. It’s disc-free so you’ll be downloading all your games onto that internal storage or onto an external SSD which you can purchase separately. It may not have 4K gaming, but it can still produce higher than standard HD resolution at 1440p. Plus, it’s got HDR support to ensure that the darks look dark and the bright colors pop. It can handle refresh rates of up to 120FPS so performance is still pretty great.</p>
<p>Like it’s counterpart, the Xbox Series X, this console has a feature called Quick Resume. No longer do you need to worry about finding a save point when you want switch to a different game. You can suspend your gameplay in the background, hop into something else, then return to it later right where you left off. My apologies to any game dev who works on title screens because I only ever see those once.</p>



<p>Quick Resume is possible because of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, which also allows for super-fast load times.</p>
<p>You can enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right on the Xbox Series S. Download apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max. While your games are locked to 1440p, you can still stream video from Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and more in full 4K.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">For a limited time, the Xbox Series S is down to just $329.</a></p>

              <p>If you found that headline confusing, try to imagine the constant bemusing misery that arrives at the door of seemingly the only other Mark Zuckerberg, an attorney who is finding his life made increasingly complicated by the shared name. So even though it’s not actually Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg that’s suing Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the mop-haired billionaire remains the cause of the consternation, because for Indiana lawyer Mark Zuckerberg, sharing the Facebook creator’s name is causing him massive issues in both his work and personal life, and indeed costing him lots of money.</p> <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/mark-zuckerberg-sues-mark-zuckerberg/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Mark S. Zuckerberg—a bankruptcy attorney from Indiana—is repeatedly having his paid-for Facebook posts removed by Meta, and his accounts closed down, on the inaccurate basis that he’s falsely impersonating Mark E. Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook—and he’s not getting his money back. He’s had enough.</p> <p>Speaking to Indiana’s WTHR, Mark S. explained that he and Facebook’s Zuck are the only two people he can find who share the name, meaning his situation is rather unique. Four times Facebook has suspended the attorney’s business account and deleted his firm’s advertisements, based on the belief that he’s deliberately trying to pass himself off as the tech billionaire, and then failing to return his resulting lost costs. So this Zuckerberg is now suing that Zuckerberg to get his money back, his legal fees paid, and potential lost money as a result of Meta’s actions.</p>

  <p>“All my competitors advertise on Facebook,” says our new favorite Mark Zuckerberg, “so I have to do it too.” Speaking to the Indianapolis news station, he says he pays for ads, “they take my money, but then they shut me down.”</p> <p>Meta gave a statement to WTHR saying, “We know there’s more than one Mark Zuckerberg in the world and we are getting to the bottom of this.”</p>

 <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s life isn’t only affected in this way. It seems sharing his name with one of the most controversial figures in the world comes with a personal cost, too. He has in fact <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/">dedicated an entire website to the topic</a>, on which he talks about how even his personal Facebook account has been suspended five times, despite providing three forms of identification each time he re-opens it, and when it’s working he’s the constant target of hacking attempts, while his phone blows up with notifications every night. (Dude, come on, just turn the notifications off. And don’t even have the app on your phone. No one should. It’s looking at data from all your other apps.) His office receives daily phone calls from furious people demanding tech support, and he says he “routinely” receives death threats and harassment via Messenger.</p> <p>In fact, at one point he was <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/docs/20250821111936235R.pdf">accidentally sued by the State of Washington</a>, which somehow mistook him for the other guy. And that must suck. Short of changing his own name (and really, the world should surely be able to cope with two people using it), he’s left resorting to legal action to at least not have it cost him money. Oh, and the attention it’s attracting in the press probably won’t do him much harm, either.</p> <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s site ends on a lovely note:</p> <p>“Like I said, I don’t wish Mark E. Zuckerberg any ill will at all. I hope the best for him, but let me tell you this: I will rule the search for ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mark+zuckerberg+bankruptcy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy</a>‘. And if he does fall upon difficult financial times, and happens to be in Indiana, I will gladly handle his case in honor of our eponymy.”</p>

                <p>Nintendo has just kicked off its Switch 2 era of gaming, but the company is also saying goodbye to its 3DS line of handheld gaming consoles. While Nintendo continued supporting the 3DS and its various models via a repair service in Japan, even after the systems were discontinued, Nintendo began to slowly wind down these operations over the years. The New Nintendo 2DS XL was the last console to be officially supported in this way, but the company has announced that this is coming to an end.</p><p>"As we have run out of parts needed for repairs, we have discontinued repair services for the New Nintendo 2DS XL as of September 4, 2025," Nintendo said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-ends-repair-support-for-new-2ds-xl-meaning-all-3ds-models-are-now-no-longer-supported/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Repairs for all other Nintendo 3DS series systems have also been discontinued."</p><p>This effectively brings the Nintendo 3DS era to a close, as Nintendo no longer has the parts necessary for it to perform repairs on units submitted to its Japanese facilities. The company ended support for the original 3DS handheld in August 2024, and it ran out of parts for the Nintendo 2DS not long after.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo closed the eShops for the 3DS and Wii U console back in 2023</a>, with repair support for the Wii U ending last year. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-is-the-last-week-your-3ds-and-wii-u-games-will-work-online/1100-6522326/">3DS doesn't have online-play functionality anymore either</a>, it's still home to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-3ds-games/2900-3935/">rich collection of games</a> that are available in a physical cartridge format.</p><p>The 3DS was a solid performer for Nintendo, as it went on to sell 75.9 million units worldwide during its run. The evolution of the best-selling Nintendo DS handheld offered an interesting 3D screen gimmick, but later models, renamed to 2DS, would drop this feature entirely. At one point, Nintendo even sold a 2DS that didn't have a clamshell design and was geared toward younger members of the family.</p><p>Meanwhile, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a solid start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/">Sales of the Switch 2 are outpacing sales of the original Switch in the US</a> by a wide margin, with 2 million units sold as of August 27. Globally, the Switch 2 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">more than 6 million units in the seven weeks after launch</a>, even with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/">relatively high price</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

Since being acquired by the Xbox maker in November 2018, the Irvine outfit has released an impressive roster of titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A sequel for the latter will be dropping in October.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio's other sophomore effort, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is already available in Xbox Game Preview and Steam Early Access. But what pushed Obsidian to revisit the little-becomes-large world of Grounded with so many other irons already in the fire?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two words: Insect mounts.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During an interview with Game Developer on Gamescom 2025 show floor, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game director Chris Parker and creative director Justin Vazquez from Eidos-Montreal—which is co-developing the sequel alongside Obsidian—suggested the title might not exist if players hadn't insisted upon bestriding bugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This was the main feature we wanted to bring to the game," says Vazquez. "It was the number one request from the community and it was the biggest justification as to why we wanted to create a new world in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even if the team had wanted to do it in the first one, the world wasn't built to support it."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vazquez explains that mounts, appropriately named 'Buggies' by the dev team, had to be designed hand-in-hand with the environment itself. "We often say we couldn't have done Buggies without the park, and we couldn't have done the park without Buggies," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, it might sound like a mechanic that's fairly easy to implement. But adding mounts to a title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> impacts the experience in a massive way. Parker explains that if you make Buggies too fast, then traversing on foot instantly becomes punishing. But, if they feel too sluggish, you'll have players questioning why they were included in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once you've figured out how fast you want the Buggie to go, then you have to figure how far apart you want the different point of interest in the world" he continues. "Then you have to tune both of these things hand-in-hand at the same time. You have the same sorts of issues with combat. Once you start fighting stuff, you're balancing for both on-foot combat and Buggie combat."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Parker says that Buggie combat had players feeling "invulnerable" during early tests and nobody was dismounting to explore as a result. The development team quickly readjusted, but then found they'd made Buggies too weak. In the playtests that followed, nobody used Buggies at all.&nbsp;"You get into these tug-of-wars with balance that was really quite challenging," adds Parker.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/unlocking-the-vault-designing-shadow-complex" target="_self" data-discover="true">How 'playful paper prototyping' paved the way for Shadow Complex - Unlocking the Vault #1</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early access development is about unearthing &quot;identifiable and actionable problems&quot;">Early access development is about unearthing "identifiable and actionable problems"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early access is a blessing and a curse when fighting those battles. Vazquez says the more time you spend in early access, the more feedback you receive. That can be incredibly useful, but as production gathers pace and more and more systems come online, it can also become overwhelming.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why it's vital to be intentional when introducing new features to players—even when you're in the middle of that early access process. "That's the balance we have to find. When is a feature complete and ready enough that we feel getting it into players hands will be valuable and still feel like a complete experience for them, but isn't so finished that there isn't room for the community to give their feedback and put their stamp on it?" Vazquez adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Buggie is a really good example, because originally we had a ton of ideas about all the different Buggies we wanted to do, but one of the first big questions we asked ourselves was 'how many do we want to do before we get them into players' hands?' The decision was made to do just two as well as possible and hand those over to players so we could get really meaningful feedback that will help influence our future Buggies."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-developers-can-learn-from-the-indie-social-co-op-games-topping-the-steam-charts" target="_self" data-discover="true">What developers can learn from the indie social co-op games topping the Steam charts</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parker says separating useful feedback from the cacophony of noise is a "tricky process." He explains Obsidian has a comms group that helps the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">team sort through everything the community is saying. The studio also uses Discord bots to let fans vote on gameplay features and other additions. The development team then gathers once a week to discuss those requests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kind of reprocess [the feedback]," says Parker. "We need to understand, when a player finds something good or difficult or whatever, whether that's a symptom of another problem. [...] By addressing this thing, will we fix that? There's a lot of philosophical conversation that goes into that."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Vazquez, early access is about translating the feelings of players into "identifiable and actionable problems" the development team can address.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How long will it actually take to balance all of those equations is anybody's guess. Parker explains he's unsure whether there's an "optimal" early access timeframe, but says it's important for people to have dates and goals to shoot for so they can evaluate their progress. He does, however, confirm that he doesn't want </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to still be kicking around in early access in five years time, so expect a full launch before 2030.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> has today received its fourth update since release, as developer Build A Rocket Boy attempts to turn around the game's fortunes.
</p>
<p>
Available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Update 4 brings improvements to the user interface, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. However, more is due in the fifth update, with the studio promising "a major performance, combat and Enemy AI system improvement".
</p>
<p>
MindsEye was heavily criticised at launch for its poor performance, among other issues. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">Build A Rocket Boy acknowledged problems</a> and stated it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". At the end of June, shortly after release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch">layoffs were confirmed</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct a ‘Call of Duty’ movie and even pitched for it.</p>



<p>For those who have been living under a rock, Paramount and Activision have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-is-officially-making-a-call-of-duty-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed on a deal</a>, and the former has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. However, we still don’t know who will be writing and/or directing the film or who will star in it. A new report reveals that the Call of Duty movie was almost directed by Spielberg. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-movie-nearly-had-steven-spielberg-as-its-director">Call of Duty Movie Nearly Had Steven Spielberg As its Director</h2>



<p>The details about Spielberg wanting to direct a Call of Duty movie through Puck’s latest <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/#selection-2355.0-2381.131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">newsletter</a>. According to three of their sources, “Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct the&nbsp;CoD&nbsp;movie and his Amblin teamed with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz to present the filmmaker’s vision for one of the world’s biggest gaming franchises.” </p>



<p>The report adds that Spielberg is “famously a big gamer” and has a special love for the Call of Duty franchise. However, when bringing Spielberg on, Activision would have to abide by his rules, which include top-of-market economics, final cut, and full control over production and marketing. These requirements “spooked” Activision, and they opted for David Ellison’s pitch instead, as it provided them with more control over the movie.  </p>



<p>Nevertheless, as this information does not come from an official source, readers should approach it with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-will-drop-100-gb-in-an-upcoming-ps5-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop 100 GB</a> in an upcoming PS5 update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Forget the weather or the date, you know we’re in a new season because of the games coming out. That’s right, it’s straight into silly season, with Silksong’s launch crashing all the console and PC stores yesterday, Hell Is Us, Cronos: The New Dawn and more! I’ll personally be making a start on Indiana Jones’&nbsp;The Order of Giants DLC today.</p>
<p>But maybe it’s actually spooky game season already? I’d say it traditionally starts in October, but Laura has other ideas, as she’s been playing Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. She says, “It’s fun switching between characters and I’m enjoying getting into Banishers lore. Plus Red has the most luscious Scottish accent, so what’s not to love?”</p>

<p>Adding weight to the spooky games in September theory is Steve, who’s reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> from Bloober Team –&nbsp;“I enjoyed it a lot and will play NG+ on when I find the time.” But time waits for no man, so he’s also been playing the “aggressively mediocre” Lost Soul Aside for review, a bit of Davy X Jones as it heads into Early Access, and has jumped into the classic action adventure of Otherskin. Ha, and he’s made a start on Silksong as well, so there’s that!</p>
<p>Aran has been continuing on with Wild Hearts and reckons he’s getting to the ending, so he’s grinding his way through gear upgrades before tackling the finale. Gringing away to improve his own skills is Ade, who’s sticking with Marvel Rivals, has joined a faction and is even thinking he might take part in an upcoming PlayStation Tournament thingy.</p>


<p>It’s been BlazBlue Entropy Effect for Jason, who says that “it slaps” and demands to know “Why did nobody tell me about it sooner?” He’s also been playing He Is Coming, but cannot get a win in the Kingmaker mode.</p>
<p>It’s been a struggle for Nic, who’s little one is poorly and had no time to play games because of it –&nbsp;I helpfully suggested Dr. Mario or the old Trauma Center games –&nbsp;and Gamoc’s also had a somewhat sucky time of it, but has snuck in some The Rogue Prince of Persia, Ghost of Tsushima, HIrogami and Discounty, albeit only in smaller doses.</p>

<p>And finally, Dom has played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/madden-26-review/">Madden 26</a> and Star Wars: Outlaws on Switch 2, and you’ll soon get to read about just how impressed he is with the latter this afternoon, while Jim played some Sword of the Sea which, “to nobody’s surprise, is a cross between Journey and ABZU.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> shines on Nintendo Switch 2, which seems to provide a better handheld experience than the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>A new video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> compares the extremely successful second entry in the series by Team Cherry running on Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam Deck, highlighting how the two systems handle the game. The differences aren't massive, unsurprisingly, but they are big enough to make some players gravitate towards either of the systems, as the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a superior handheld experience thanks to its bigger screen with 120 FPS support, while the Steam Deck offers better versatility in docked mode, capable of pushing past 120 FPS with ease at multiple resolutions. The game's native support for the Steam Deck's 1280x800p resolution is also rather welcome, as well as the slightly faster load times, compared to the Switch 2 version. All in all, there's no clear winner, but for handheld play, it seems like Hollow Knight: Silksong is best experienced on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been in the works for a long time, and the almost complete silence Team Cherry held since the game's announcement only added to fan excitement, which literally exploded yesterday when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">the game finally launched on PC and consoles</a>, overwhelming Steam and other digital stores as users rushed to download the game. Needless to say, the game is setting out to be a smashing success and of the most popular releases of the year, as it managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">beat its predecessor's Steam concurrent users record in mere minutes.</a></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developers Team Cherry are "working to improve" the game's Simplified Chinese translation, following "quality issues" which have seen its Steam user reviews from those speaking the language drop to "mixed".</p>
<p>As you can easily see thanks to Steam's recent introduction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-now-has-language-specific-review-scores-which-might-make-identifying-certain-review-bombs-easier">language-specific review splits</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/#app_reviews_hash">the mixed reviews</a> are unique to the 6,382 people who've left verdicts in Simplified Chinese so far. For every other language, including Traditional Chinese, the impressions being left are either mostly or overwhelmingly positive, though it's worth noting that a sizeable number are more shows of support for Team Cherry than proper reviews, being based on less than an hour's playtime.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team Cherry have clearly spotted this, with the studio's marketing and publishing director Matthew 'Leth' Griffin having <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963798473700168146">posted a message</a> to Chinese-speaking Skongers. "We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>," he tweeted. "We'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support."</p>
<p>Issues with this translation of metroidvania were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595157852293939174/">flagged online</a> as early as its recent Gamescom demo in late August, with one user describing it as "terrible" and adding "if there are no changes in the official version, I am afraid there is a risk of bad reviews".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another user in that thread added: "If the demo’s text reflects what we’ll see in the final release, I must say the translation style in the demo differs greatly from the first game. Many lines feel unnatural, and some are even quite awkward or confusing in Chinese."</p><p>According to our Guides Writer Jeremy, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">half-Chinese and categorises his knowledge of the language as moderate with speaking fluency</a>, the unnaturalness of the translation appears to stem from the use of classical grammar, a bit like an English translation which uses words like 'thee' and 'thou'. Shakespearean Skong. Sounds like it could be a fun time, were you not just trying to lose yourself in a game you've waited ages for.</p>
<p>Wherefore art thou, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">Eric Barone cameo</a>?</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry's planned translantion tweaks do let Chinese players enjoy jumping about as Hornet as much as many other Steam reviewers appear to be, without being subjected to bardly prose.</p>

              <p>The Switch 2’s game key cards have <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">proven a source of extreme consternation</a> since the launch of Nintendo’s latest console. Physical carts in plastic boxes that don’t actually contain the game at all, making a mockery of game preservation and the entire purpose of owning a physical copy of your game. The reason for their use is usually presumed to be cost, given how expensive a 64GB Switch card is for a publisher (apparently $23 each!), and that Nintendo <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">right now</a> is not offering a smaller option to publishers. However, in the case of Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> it seems it’s&nbsp;due to a more significant weakness of the Switch 2.</p> <p>So far, tech geeks are super-impressed with how Ubisoft has managed to get such a large, complex open-world game working on the handheld console. As much of a step up from the original Switch as the Switch 2 might be, it’s still not exactly cutting-edge technology, and the requirements to be able to run on a handheld device can be restrictive. So great work by all involved! However, <em>Outlaws</em> has become yet another entry in the very long list of games releasing with nothing but a game key on an otherwise blank cart, and understandably people are narked about spending $60 to buy a pile of empty plastic.</p> <p>More than anything else, it’s the knowledge that Nintendo absolutely&nbsp;<em>will</em> one day switch off the eStore that processes the keys to allow the games to be downloaded. As with every previous generation of digital store, the servers will go away, and the purchased games will disappear into the ether. This leaves people either looking at emulation (which Nintendo deeply loathes), or re-buying the same game again when it’s released as a “Classic” download on the newer device (where, hilariously, Nintendo makes it available via emulation). This all enormously sucks. So yes, one day your copy of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Switch 2 will be nothing but a very bad-tasting SD card.</p>

 <p>Except, it seems in this particular instance this isn’t an act of cost-cutting on a premium-price game. (For whatever reason, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-max-cartridge-size/">Nintendo has only offered 64GB cards for the Switch 2</a>, driving up production costs and encouraging many to resort to key cards instead.) However, according to Rob Bantin (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">thanks <em>Nintendo Life</em></a>), the audio architect on <em>Outlaws</em>‘ engine Snowdrop, it’s because the streaming speeds between the Switch 2 carts and the console just aren’t fast enough to run the game properly. And that seems like it could be a big deal.</p> <p><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lxx7nqqits2t">posted on BlueSky</a> to report how impressed he was with the port, reposting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m_cu6LfAuA"><em>VGC</em>‘s video about the tech</a>, adding that&nbsp;<em>DF</em> has its own video on the way. Others replied, one person pointing out that the game is somehow only 20.2GB, but another expressing disdain that it’s a key card. After a bit of back and forth, Rob Bantin entered the conversation and revealed all.</p>   <p>“Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments,” said Bantin. “And we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for.” In other words, the game needs to be fully installed on the console’s SSD drive to be able to run properly. The audio architect continued, “I don’t recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion – probably because it was moot.”</p>   <p>It’s hard to know how big of an issue this is going to be for the Switch 2 over the next seven or eight years of its likely life, but given a 2024 port can’t run off the card because of speed limitations, other larger, open-world games could share some similar issues. We’re talking about games releasing in 2030 after all. However, Bantin offers some optimism. “I think if we designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different,” he added. “As it was, we’d build [sic] a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call.”</p>

 <p>We’re stepping beyond my nerdy understanding here, but from my research the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwgdn433kc27">Switch 2 cards are limited</a> to 400MB/s transfer rates, while the <a href="https://www.thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sd-express/nintendo-switch-2-powered-with-silicon-motion-sm2708-sd-express-controller-for-800mb-s-speeds/#:~:text=The%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20console,the%20normal%20NVMe%20SSD%20protocol.">Switch 2’s SSD can offer close to 900MB/s</a>. So that’s a obviously a significant difference. However, it’s crucial to note that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> runs from its game card at 400MB/s, and there are few complaints there. So if games are intentionally designed for the Switch 2’s card limitations, this might not be a frequent issue? But, again, it does mean that releasing a cross-platform game could require a huge amount of heavy lifting to make a version that runs from a card, when the PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions will all be installing to SSD. (Why Nintendo doesn’t allow SSD installation from game cards is another massive question, and seemingly a very obvious solution.) And, let’s not forget, the Switch 2 will be overlapping the second half of its life with the inevitable PlayStation 6 and Xbox Series 2.</p> <p>It’s all a pretty pickle for developers looking to release big games on the Switch 2, without pissing off audiences and rendering their games ethereal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"First game I've bought day of release in a decade."</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The splash damage caused by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>’s massive launch impact has spread beyond huge Steam concurrents and struggling storefronts to the parts of the internet where video game pirates hang out — and there something interesting is happening: the pirates are urging each other to buy the game instead of downloading the cracked version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry’s hotly anticipated Hollow Knight sequel finally came out on September 4, 2025 priced $20, six years after it was announced, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-storefronts-including-steam">instantly crashed storefronts including Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the storefronts recovered, player numbers swelled to the point where Silksong hit an incredible launch day peak of 535,213 concurrent players on Steam, enough to make it the 18th most-played game ever on Valve’s platform. The true player count across all platforms will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong also launched DRM-free on GOG, so it was no surprise to see a cracked version available to download in the hours after launch. What was a surprise was the response from some veteran video game pirates, who urged their peers to support Team Cherry and buy the game instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First game I've bought day of release in a decade probably,” said pyrokzg on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1n8bkmo/that_was_fucking_fast/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the piracy subreddit</a> in response to a thread upvoted 7,000 times. “Not even the decade for me. It's the very first,” added Vamsi-Thopu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why is this happening? Clearly, there is a huge amount of goodwill from across the internet directed at Team Cherry, the small indie developer that saw the original Hollow Knight blow up to such an extent that it was able to take its merry time with this ambitious sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s also a feeling that Team Cherry does things the right way. For a start, there’s a DRM-free version available at launch, but the Australian studio was also keen to honor the promises it made with its original Hollow Knight Kickstarter all those years ago. There’s even a free upgrade for the Nintendo Switch 2 version. In short, Team Cherry are the good guys, and the feeling is they deserve their success.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a 3-4 person team that has done right by their fans at every turn,” said No-Shape6053, also on the piracy subreddit. “Making sure the PC release is DRM free. Making sure all original backers of Hollow Knight get Silksong free on their choice of platform. This is a time where if we can afford to support them, we should.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Support the devs if you can, they deserve it,” added iTzNowbie. There’s plenty more where that came from, too. “The only game I will feel bad if I ever pirated it,” said beastfire24. “Hey the game is pretty cheap. This one, we should not pirate,” said Sythrin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, some have expressed surprise at the collective urge not to pirate Silksong, which itself prompted a discussion about why this is happening with Silksong but hasn’t happened with similarly beloved indie games in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Usually people here claim that the title, price, or the indie status makes no difference to them, but I guess that Silksong is just that respected,” offered MixaLv.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m surprised too,” added ALIIERTx. “Many times people are like, ‘I don’t care if I pirate from indie developer,’ but on this one everyone is pretty defensive against piracy. I’m fascinated.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses to this reinforce the Team Cherry angle. "Team Cherry has built themselves an amazing reputation," suggested Someone_Existing_1. "Because they’re only a three-person studio, they can keep their games super cheap due to far less employees needing pay. Also they aren’t greedy f***s like most companies, so their DLCs are all free and there’s no microtransactions or online-only bulls**t."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's Silksong coverage, which includes the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-1693-days-of-videos-the-superfan-behind-youtube-channel-daily-silksong-news-can-finally-rest"><u>story of the superfan behind the YouTube Channel Daily Silksong News, who can finally rest after an incredible 1,693 days of videos</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting out Silksong?

This lightsaber is Vader's version of the latter — meaning it was used for the fight sequences in both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/screenshot-2025-0ss9-05-111504-1757067447913.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Darth Vader's lightsaber.

			<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> movie directed by Steven Spielberg could have been a thing, but Activision eventually refused the legendary director's pitch for a very specific reason.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/">Puck News</a>, Steven Spielberg, who's a big gamer and a fan of the Call of Duty series, wanted to direct the movie based on the franchise, which sounded like a pretty great idea, considering how much some of his movies have influenced the franchise. Teaming up with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz, the director's team pitched his vision to Activision, which was reportedly spooked by the famous Spielberg deal, including top-market economics and full control over final cut, production and marketing. Instead, the publisher now owned by Microsoft went with David Ellison's pitch to retain more control over the movie, handing the production to Paramount.</p>



<p>Given the series's immense popularity, a Call of Duty movie was long overdue. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">Announced earlier this week</a>, the first movie based on the Activision series could only be the beginning of a cinematic universe across film and television series, although, for the time being, the focus will be on this movie, whose director has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>The next entry in the series, which will be facing some serious competition this year with the highly anticipated Battlefield 6, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The game is primarily developed by Treyarch, with support from Raven Software for the campaign development, which promises to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-reveal-analysis/">shake things up quite a bit</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One on November 14.</p>

        <p>Begun, the "Koyukification" has</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Late last month, players of Nexon's tactical schoolgirl gacha fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-archive">Blue Archive</a> were horrified to discover that their universe had undergone Koyukification. For context, Kurosaki Koyuki is one of Blue Archive's recruitable characters, a twin-tailed pinkhead known for her immense natural code-breaking skills, her passion for gambling, and her mischievous persona. 
</p>
<p>
On August 31st, Blue Archivists logged onto discover that Koyuki had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleypires.bsky.social/post/3ly2cxqdos22w">multiplied like a virus</a>. Cafes and arcades teemed with duplicates of the character. Her snaggle-toothed rictus filled the game's recruitment banners. The very information page - once a source of guidance and solace to so many - had been edited to read "nihahaha", in mimicry of the character's giggle. 
</p>
<p>
It was kind of like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fVfIejbfM"> this scene from Being John Malkovich</a>, if John Malkovich had been a freakazoid 15-year-old piker armed with a light machinegun. And also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBmH1M4DSSU">the closing scenes from Matrix Revolutions</a> (Koyuki's in-game nickname is "White Rabbit"), if Neo and Agent Smith had decided to lay off the kung fu and sample the local parfait.
</p>
<p>
How to explain these nightmarish events? It was a hack, obviously. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/blue-archive-got-hacked-but-the-hacker-just-spawned-the-same-character-everywhere-without-touching-valuable-data-nexon-confirms/">Automaton West</a>, publishers Nexon took Blue Archive offline for a few hours that Sunday to expunge the excess Koyukis and carry out an investigation. Seemingly, this was the good kind of hack, carried out for the glee of it rather than to filch anybody's credit card details. Or at least, that's what they're saying publicly.
</p><p>
<a href="https://forum.nexon.com/bluearchive-en/board_view?board=3028&amp;thread=3123126">According to Nexon</a>'s subsequent notice to players, somebody managed to break into the game's content delivery network and mess with the environment settings, which are managed separately from the game itself, redirecting them to an IP address in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The hacker's changes only "affected the client-side content display", it seems. Nexon say that "players' accounts, game data, and payment information were not affected, as they are operated in a separate database and always revalidated by the game server."
</p>
<p>
You may find the idea of your online gameworld being suddenly suffused by goblin cryptanalysts amusing. Rest assured that Nexon do not. Aside from introducing new restrictions and countermeasures, they've reported the whole ordeal to the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency. They've also prepared a player compensation package of in-game McGuffins to say sorry for the emergency maintenance period. Thoughts and prayers, etc.

</p>
<p>Is Blue Archive worth playing post-Koyukification? I can tell you nothing save that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHy8JmWX3kw&amp;t=62s">this trailer</a> thoroughly weirded me out with its bright and breezy scenes of school life in which everybody present is packing enough firepower to clear out a Terminid nest.</p>

            <p>
The games industry has been wracked by layoffs in the last few years, but over half of all layoffs have been in California, with North America overall the worst hit region.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Amir Satvat, who spoke to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/over-50-of-the-job-cuts-in-video">The Game Business</a> on the topic. Satvar was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-first-game-changers-recipient-responds-to-hateful-and-disturbing-comments-accusing-him-of-fraud">first recipient of the Game Changers award</a> at The Game Awards 2024 for his work assisting laid-off employees across the industry.
</p>
<p>
"Over 70 percent, and in some years 75 percent, of the layoffs have been in North America," said Satvat. "North America used to have 30 percent, 35 percent, 40 percent of the open roles, and that number is now down to 25 percent."
</p>
<p>
Globally, employment in the games industry has increased since before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, though that depends on region. While Asia has seen an increase in jobs, North America has seen its workforce in AAA studios cut by 15 to 20 percent.
</p>
<p>
"And here's another stat," added Satvat, "over 50 percent of the cuts globally have been in California. California AAA is like the epicentre of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
"There is opportunity, but it may be that if you want to stay in the industry, being open to going to some of these places like China, like Japan, not forever, but for some amount of time, that's going to become a larger part of the equation."
</p>
<p>
The most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">high profile layoffs recently were from Microsoft back in June</a>, which included the cancellation of Perfect Dark from the California-based The Initiative, though developers were affected on both sides of the pond.
</p>
<p>
So far this year, an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">estimated 4400 people</a> have been laid off globally in the games industry.

            <p>Many of us have a few things to say about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s controversial game key cards, which don't actually contain game data, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device</a>. However, developer Rob Bantin, who is an audio architect on Ubisoft's game engine Snowdrop, has revealed why the studio opted for key cards when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lands-september-switch-2-release-date">Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e">reply to Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' use of key cards and whether or not cost was a factor, Bantin explained that full-fat cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for".</p>

<p>Bantin noted the Snowdrop engine "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments", adding they "don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot".</p>
<p>The developer said had Star Wars Outlaws been designed for Nintendo's Switch 2 console from the beginning, things may have been different. "As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later," Bantin said.</p>
<p>"In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p>

<p>Many third party developers have also opted for key cards for their own Switch 2 release. One high profile outlier was CDPR, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-developer-comments-on-switch-2-key-cards-says-having-proper-cartridge-with-a-plug-and-play-experience-is-right-thing-to-do">released Cyberpunk 2077 as a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it</a>. Last month, it was revealed that out of all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Switch 2 sales in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">over 75 percent were physical</a>.</p>

<p>You're looking at <strong>$19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> for the new release which, given the sheer length of its development and presumptions around its runtime, seems very reasonable indeed. Some folks, however, think that Team Cherry has legitimately priced the game too low, and therefore may be distorting players' expectations regarding what a $20 game should look like (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Eurogamer</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hiqpvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First up is BastiArtGames, the solo-developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lone_fungus">Lone Fungus</a>, who took to <a href="https://x.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783">X</a> and asked what its sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463220/Lone_Fungus_Melody_of_Spores/">Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores</a>, should be priced at now that Silksong has launched. The game was originally targeting a price of $20, which the developer had considered fair, but is now questioning whether it should be lowered to undercut Silksong.</p>

<p>Similarly, RJ Lake, who is directing the upcoming rhythm game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Unbeatable</a>, posted a thread stating that while he is pleased that Silksong is so cheap, it could have severe ramifications on how players perceive the value of games, stating that "'The Gamer' is a creature very bad at knowing why things cost what they do".</p>

<p>Developer Toukana, who worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and is now about to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Star Birds</a>, told Eurogamer that the latter's price has also been affected following the game's short delay from 4th September to 10th September:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, Silksong's price has influenced our decision. We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an interesting situation, to be sure, but we also think a significant jump in price from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> to Hollow Knight: Silksong would have almost certainly ruffled a few feathers. Given the anticipation around the game along with how few people were involved in its development, we reckon Team Cherry probably made the correct decision regarding price.</p>

<p><em>But what do you think, dear readers? Is Silksong priced appropriately, or do you think Team Cherry could have gotten away with pricing it higher? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>
