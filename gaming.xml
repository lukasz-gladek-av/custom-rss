            <p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">week-long coverage of PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> continues today with the concluding half of our special Shawn Layden interview, this time discussing the future of PlayStation and video game consoles as we know them today.
</p>
<p>Where will PlayStation be in another 30 years? The end of consoles has long been prophesised, but at a time of spiralling AAA game budgets, Â£700 premium upgrades and an audience leaving for TikTok, the thought of us sitting here in 2054 celebrating PS9 seems increasingly unlikely. </p>
<p>So where does the console games industry go from here? How do you counter those enormous budgets? How can games change? And have we got to the point where, to a large extent, the hardware we play on doesn't matter? Read on for more insight from Shawn Layden, former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, and a definitive response on whether he thinks PlayStation will ever launch games on Xbox. </p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about the video game industry currently? You've mentioned not seeing innovative new games like PaRappa the Rapper anymore. Where are the new genres?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I guess you get new genre activity at the indies level, where there's more risk tolerance. You have got to take the risk, otherwise you're not gonna get anywhere. But I'm afraid that the current cost of game development, with AAA console titles costing in the hundreds of millions, squeezes risk tolerance out of the room. </p>
<blockquote>'Show me how the trend line is going to be exactly like Grand Theft Auto'</blockquote>
<p>If you're looking at something that's going to clock in at $160m to produce, the immediate reaction of the finance guys is, 'okay, what is that comparable to? How are you going to make me feel better? Can you show me how the trend line is going to be exactly like Grand Theft Auto, so then I can feel fine putting money behind it?' It results in a lot of copycats, a lot of sequels. 'Give me GTA 7, because I know how to plot that course.'</p>
<p>It's squeezing, I think, creativity out at the high end and that's a problem. On PS1 and PS2, one unit of hardware could sell 25 games. With PS3 and PS4, largely due to the network effect of people getting online, it's much lower. Once you're in your online world with your online friends, you don't leave. I have a son and I don't think FIFA ever leaves his machine. I think it's permanently embedded inside his PS5. And if you go down the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> rabbit hole or the Warzone rabbit hole, you don't play a lot of other games. So I'm concerned about that lack of breadth.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>There's been discussion recently around how console generations aren't growing over time, either. Is it enough to keep selling to the same sized audience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> So yes, if you stack it up and look at all the things that were around during the PS1 era, whether it's Saturn and N64, or the PS2 and Xbox era, no generation seems to get over 250m units of hardware, aggregate. The one time it popped is when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-fit">Wii Fit</a> came out and a bunch of people thought they could lose weight by buying a Nintendo [Wii]. There's that momentary Christmas, 'oh, let's lose weight' thing which shot up the console number, but then it fell back down again. </p>
<blockquote>We're not growing the next generation. We're losing the next generation to TikTok</blockquote>
<p>Even when you hear that gaming revenue went up 23 percent during the pandemic, it wasn't from new people, necessarily. It was more money from the <em>same </em>people, and this is the existential threat I talk about when I'm meeting with developers and publishers - that you're just getting more money off the same people. It's a business model I understand, and you understand, and that's fine. But we're not growing the next generation. We're losing the next generation to TikTok. The competition for gaming isn't Xbox and Nintendo. It's everything else in the freaking zeitgeist that can take your time away from your gaming activity.</p>
<p>The pandemic gave us an unnatural pop for gaming, where we thought, 'oh my god, gaming is the biggest thing in the world'. Yeah, when you're locked down, it is the biggest thing in the world. But in a regular world scenario, you've got to combat against all the other distractions that are available to young people. And I'm afraid that we're not facing that threat head on as an industry.</p>
<p><strong>So then, how do we face that threat head on as an industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> We need to address two or three things specifically. One thing is the exploding cost of game development. Every generation it costs twice as much to build a game. What costs $1m on PS1, then costs two, then four, then 16. It goes exponentially. The PS4 generation, which was the last I was associated with, game dev was 150m if you want to be top of the line, and that's before marketing. So by that math, PS5 games should eventually reach $300m to $400m - and that is just outright not sustainable.</p>
<blockquote>I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further</blockquote>
<p>It's like we're at the end of the 18th century, and we're realising that building cathedrals is really expensive. Can we continue to build these massive edifices to God for this incredible amount of labour and time? Or should we just build four walls and a roof, and that's a church, right? I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further. In fact, it's probably grown too far already.</p>
<p>How do we cap that? How do we bring that back? I think part of that answer is - and it sounds simplistic, but hear me out - I think games are too long. I haven't even opened <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, because I don't have 90 hours. And I'm retired and I don't have 90 hours. For the longest time, we kept banging on about '100 hours of gameplay'. 'This is going to be awesome. It's 100 hours of gameplay!' Like that's the most important thing to know. That was a metric in the early years, when the average gamer was 18 to 23. And when you're 18 to 23, you're time rich and money poor. But as the average age of the gamer moved into the late 20s, the early 30s - well, it's the opposite, right? Maybe you aren't money rich, but you're definitely time poor. So I think our approach is a mismatch to that market, to reality. </p><p>I've made a bunch of games that were 80, 90 hours long so I'll be the first to say those weren't always 100 percent quality hours. There were a lot of moments in there where I really felt 'am I running across this same field again?' I would like to see a world where you can get back to 18 to 23 hours of gameplay, but with gameplay so compelling you don't want to put the controller down. I want the entire game to be like that moment in Resident Evil where the freaking dogs come through the window and you drop your controller out of fear. I want more of those kinds of game moments, if we can bring down the scale and scope.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>It feels like each generation is getting lumbered with ever higher production costs, production values, and we're seeing a smaller selection of games as a result - at least on consoles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Yeah, rendering at 480p was not very expensive, but doing 4K at 60fps, that's a lot of people, a lot of time. Let's look at our obsession with photorealism, chasing that uncanny valley. From what I've seen, it's non-traversable. Don't chase that. I think a photorealistic Mario would be kind of off-putting, frankly. Or when they did that first Sonic draft for the Sonic movie with teeth.</p>
<blockquote>What would Coppola do if you walked out halfway through his movie? Is this a good use of resources?</blockquote>
<p>On PS1, our expectation walking down the street in a game was that you couldn't open every door. Now the expectation is you can go in every house, open every drawer and everything is destructible. And that's nice, but it's expensive to make that happen. We have to look at that. If only 50 percent of players see the end of your game, what about all those millions you spend on the final level, for only half the people to see it. There's so much money being put into making huge game experiences and people aren't seeing it. What would Coppola do if you walked out halfway through his movie? We have to understand - is this a good use of resources? I want a movement that gets more people to finish games, where we make it so compelling they just want to see it, and where it's not so onerous they don't have to spend three months doing it.</p>

<p><strong>Can consoles continue to exist, long-term? Xbox is already publishing to multiple platforms, and now rival consoles. Will PlayStation survive another 30 years just publishing on its own consoles and PC? Will Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Let's put Nintendo aside for a second, because they live in their Own Private Idaho, where the laws of physics apply in different sorts of ways. But with Xbox versus PlayStation, the Ali versus Frazier fight... Frankly, we have to start interrogating what the purpose is of a proprietary console, and whether that can continue to be true.</p>
<blockquote>We're getting to the realm, frankly, where only dogs can hear the difference</blockquote>
<p>If you look at it from my lens, which is of course the PlayStation lens, the leap from PS1 to PS2 was dramatic. I remember seeing the PS2 demo for Gran Turismo and not believing this could happen in a home console, but it did. The jump from PS2 to PS3 was also remarkable. We got to an HD standard. We got - not all, but a lot of - 60fps gameplay. It had a network capability, nascent though it was. Then PS3 to PS4 was just, like, getting the network thing done right. Then to PS5, which is a fantastic piece of kit, but the actual difference in performance... we're getting to the realm, frankly, where only dogs can hear the difference now. You're not going to see another PS1 to PS2 jump in performance - we have sort of maxed out there. If we're talking about teraflops and ray-tracing, we're already off the sheet that most people begin to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Consoles are never getting a big leap in power again?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I don't think so. I mean, what would that leap look like? It would be perfectly-realised human actors in a game that you completely control. That could happen one day. I don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime. We're at a point now where the innovation curve on the hardware is starting to plateau, or top out. At the same time, the commoditisation of the silicon means that when you open up an Xbox or Playstation, it's really pretty much the same chipset. It's all built by AMD. Each company has their own OS and proprietary secret sauce, but in essence [it's the same]. I think we're pretty much close to final spec for what a console could be.</p>
<p><strong>It almost sounds like you're calling a truce to the console wars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Well... You're not as old as I am, obviously, but you've read stories about something called VHS versus Betamax, right?</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Betamax_blank_top_(modified)_(tape_only).jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p><strong>My dad had a Betamax at home when I was growing up, and as I'm saying this I realise this is going to make you feel old. [For our younger readers, Betamax was Sony's less successful answer to VHS.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> [Laughs] Thanks to your dad. So, one of the first jobs I had when I joined Sony in 1987 was in the PR department in Tokyo, and one of the first things I had to write was a corporate statement about why Sony was going to start building VHS recorders and how we weren't abandoning Betamax. We were just 'expanding our offerings to our consumers to fit their lifestyle needs'. But that's what happened. And my whole life has now gone full circle, because when you have competing formats, competing platforms, competing technologies, there comes a time when we all declare the war is over.</p>
<blockquote>Content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind</blockquote>
<p>This is why, after the VHS vs Betamax fight, you saw industry consortiums come together for things like compact discs and then DVDs. 'This is the technology we're going to land on. These are the specs around that tech that we're going to agree to.' You might compete on price points and its aesthetics - do you want it in wood or black or orange? - but the real competition will be on its content. And content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind. I think we're at a point where the console becomes irrelevant in the next... if not the next generation then the next <em>next </em>generation definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Consoles are now getting mid-gen upgrades, which I feel further erodes those big generational steps. You've said in the past that chasing teraflops has diminishing returns, but are they something of a niche worth investing in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The first time Sony really did a mid-range upgrade was PlayStation 4 Pro - because up until then new versions of its consoles usually were where we brought the cost down. We used fewer parts, you got a better, more compact footprint. It was smaller and cheaper. PS4 Pro was the first time we said 'OK, instead of continuing to reduce the size and the cost of the standard model, we have some tech here. We have some abilities to take the current PS4 game library and juice it up'. I think it worked really well on PS4. I think there was also some market pricing that made it an easier transition from your standard PS4 to get a Pro three years later. But again, now we're all chasing that diminishing returns point where I'm unsure if people can really tell the difference. </p>
<blockquote>It's a connoisseur market, shall we say</blockquote>
<p>If you're playing your game with your curtains open and the sunlight is hitting against your OLED, you're not seeing any ray-tracing in real-world scenarios. It's really hard to get the full impact of some of these innovations without having the perfect viewing experience. We're going into the mid-gen now with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> at a robust price point, so to speak, and it remains to be seen who the market is for that. I think it's a connoisseur market, shall we say.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of competing for content, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">PlayStation and Kadokawa Corporation look ready to tie the knot</a>, meaning Sony likely owns FromSoftware and could decide exclusivity for the next Elden Ring. What are your thoughts there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The two companies have always been close. The FromSoftware association goes back to the early days of PlayStation, they were one of the launch partners, coming out with games back then. And then if you look at the board of directors, historically there's been a number of Sony people who've served on boards at Kadokawa, that type of thing. They're not strangers, that's for sure. I don't know what the timeline is on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2, I'm sure it's a bit down the pike.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p><strong>If console hardware becomes somewhat irrelevant, does competing on content see Sony putting PlayStation games on Xbox, as Microsoft has done on PlayStation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I don't know what the business imperative would be to do that.</p>
<p>Playstation has been the leader for almost every generation it's been in. You talk about Xbox 360 being a huge competitor with PS3 and, for a while... they got out the gate sooner, they grew a large market. But in the end PlayStation fought to a tie in America and the UK. With Xbox 360 we look at a global footprint and PlayStation is far and away the global leader, because it is the leading platform in 170 countries around the world. Microsoft never had that kind of global reach, so they could never build a global market to the scale that PlayStation does.</p>
<blockquote>You know the Sony fanbase gets really upset whenever a game comes out on PC</blockquote>
<p>So the question you're asking is: should PlayStation, with that huge market lead and the momentum, apparently, going forward, should they build versions of their games to run on a competing platform of much smaller size and scale? As the saying goes, I don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze. How many additional sales would they get versus the brand impact, all the aggro? You know the Sony fanbase gets really upset whenever a game comes out on PC, 18 months after the original release on PlayStation. I never understood that aggro but, you know, it's there. And if that's what they're going to say about a PC release, just imagine what the market would say about Xbox releases from PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p><strong>How about PlayStation games on Nintendo, then? We've just seen Lego Horizon Adventures arrive there, which was a first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Historically, PlayStation and Nintendo platforms have lived happily side by side in living rooms across the world. It's almost like a natural pairing.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like Sony might have finally forgiven Nintendo for leaving them at the altar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> You know, success is the best revenge.</p>

			<p>GSC Game World has released a new patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Update 1.0.3 continues with the crash and bug fixes, following the initial fixes introduced with <a href="https://wccftech.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl-receives-two-patches-focused-on-bug-fixes-optimizations-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updates 1.0.1 and 1.0.2</a>. Take a look at the full changelog below:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Mouse Smoothing is disabled by default.</em></li>
<li><em>Mouse Acceleration is disabled by default.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additionally, default values of mouse sensitivity were updated to allow a predictable default experience for our players with new values of two parameters mentioned below:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Camera sensitivity: 25%.</em></li>
<li><em>Aim sensitivity: 15%.</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over a million units, though it is unclear how much it needs to sell to recoup its many years of development. By the way, our full review is now available <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

			<p>Just two days before the game's official launch (the full version is scheduled for December 9, but owners of the Premium Edition can start playing on December 6), MachineGames has revealed the official PC system requirements for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>The game runs on the id Tech engine, which usually means a high frame rate for everyone. However, it is clear that this game's goal is different, probably due to its cinematic nature and<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its focus on adventure rather than shooting</a>. The system requirements are rather heavy as a whole, and they request hardware ray tracing support - the first time any triple-A game has demanded that your GPU includes this feature.</p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-and-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> the game would include full-fledged path tracing, like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 and Remedy's Alan Wake 2. However, its ultra PT requirements are even more demanding than those titles. Gamers will need the best CPU and GPU combination money can buy, and DLSS Frame Generation will have to be coupled with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode.</p>

        <p>Games as a service "remains a pillar of our strategy"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft have discontinued their PvP shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and laid off roughly 277 employees at the studios who worked on the multiplayer game. "[Weâve] not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market," said Ubisoft executive Marie-Sophie de Waubert in a statement to workers that was later posted <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">on Ubisoft's website</a>. Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are "transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The multiplayer servers will stay up until June, said de Waubert, and the latest season will still be added to the game. But you won't be able to download the game and register to play, nor buy anything in-game if you currently have the shooter installed. Anything players have bought in the last 30 days will also be refunded. </p>
<p>"[This] decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney," says de Waubert in the post, using the soft verb "departing" to refer to her company's axing of roles, as if these people are simply stepping on a plane of their own volition. I'll add it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">the list</a>.</p>
<p>Despite increasingly clear signs that the games-as-a-service business model is risky (and for some of us <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">deeply tiring</a>), the Ubichief claims the company's focus on that won't change. She cites past support for games that struggled before becoming sustainable, such as tactical shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and 3v3 ahistorical brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>.</p>
<p>"Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy," says de Waubert. "Itâs a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles."</p>

<p>None of that will be much comfort to the people who are out of work, I imagine. Although it is possible this is not a surprise either. Back in September <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">a report by Insider Gaming</a> claimed management was unhappy with the game and already considering putting a bullet in it. In response to these rumours, executive producer Mark Rubin insisted XDefiant was "not dying" in an official blog post. </p><p>"No, the game is absolutely not dying," said Rubin just months ago. "We know there are things we need to improve... but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan. Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that.â</p>
<p>That has not proven to be the case. Ubisoft's support of the game - and its workers - lasted just over six months. Rubin's rebuttal of those early reports of discontent has since been scrubbed from Ubisoft's website, replaced with yesterday's closure news. But you can get the gist from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-call-of-duty-fps-ubisoft-dying-rubin-road-map-1851651645">this Kotaku report</a> or see the update using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241007190908/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG/year-1-update">the Wayback machine</a>. </p>
<p>"Ubisoft's arena shooter XDefiant needs to do more to stand out from the crowd," said our Ollie after playing a preview build and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xdefiant-preview">walking away unconvinced</a>. It's not impossible to imagine improvements and redesigns might have seen the shooter eventually prosper. As Ubisoft themselves remind us, they have done it before with Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor. But it appears Ubisoft management no longer hope for such turnarounds. The result is clear: nearly 300 people now have to find new jobs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> right on the cusp of release, MachineGames has revealed what you need to run the game on PC, confirming the Minimum specs as well as what their Recommended and Ultra PC builds look like.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is built on id Tech 7, the latest version of id Softwareâs excellent game engine, as previously seen in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>. Itâs a fully featured engine that incorporates the latest ray tracing techniques, upscaling, and more.</p>


<p>MachineGames has provided three performance targets, with Minimum aiming for 1080p60 native at the âLowâ preset, Recommended aiming for 1440p60 native at the âHighâ preset, and Ultra targeting a full 4K at 60FPS with the âUltraâ preset.</p>
<p>The main requirement to be aware of is that the game now requires a GPU with ray tracing compatibility, which means the GeForce 20 series, Radeon 6000 series and Intelâs Arc A series. It will also need at least 8GB of VRAM.</p>
<p>Hereâs the full official breakdown</p>

<p>Full ray tracing is also coming to Nvidiaâs 40 series, with the same graphical preset, resolution and performance targets, just with fully path traced lighting throughout the game. Everything about the system requirements remains the same outside of the GPU, which will be an RTX 4070 for Low, RTX 4080 for High and RTX 4090 for Ultra.</p>
<p>The caveat is that full ray tracing at those targets requires the use of DLSS 3 with Frame Generation and the use of Super Resolution upscaling. Path tracing is heavy work!</p>

<p>Indiana Jones is out on 9th December across PC, Xbox Series X|S and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> with âday oneâ access (PC Games Pass and Game Pass Ultimate). However, thereâs an early access window for pre-orders coming later this week on 6th December.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has announced that they are shutting down their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a>, starting the process of sunsetting the game last night with a server shutdown coming in June 2025. This announcement comes just half a year after XDefiantâs launch, though Season 3 will still happen for those who stick around.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As a consequence of the shutdown, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">Ubisoft is laying off 277 people</a> from their San Francisco, Osaka and Sydney teams. Around half of the global team is able to be moved on to other projects, but these three studio locations are being closed in San Francisco and Osaka, and Sydney is scaling back.</p>


<p>Hereâs the timeline for the shutdown</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd December 2024</strong> â XDefiant delisted from digital stores, new player registrations are blocked, and players can no longer purchase any content.</li>
<li><strong>3rd June 2025</strong> â XDefiant servers will go offline, but existing players will have full access to the game and any upcoming content until this date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players who purchased the Ultimate Founderâs Pack will receive a full refund, and any purchases made within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. This will happen within the next 8 weeks by 28th January 2025 â <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players">see the FAQ for more details</a>.</p>
<p>Executive Producer Mark Rubin gave the following message:</p>

<p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post. Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p>
<p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when XDefiant launched was amazingâwe broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p>
<p>If thereâs one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, itâs the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This âplayer-firstâ mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made XDefiant so special. From my very first post about XDefiant, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p>
<p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around XDefiant. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p>
<p>The announcement comes just half a year after the gameâs launch on 21st May, with Ubisoftâs latest crack at a live service game mashing together all their Tom Clancy franchises into an arcade-y first person shooter. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">At the time we said</a>, âExactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time.â</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Ubisoft San Francisco team, it soon became clear that XDefiant strike the kind of overwhelmingly positive buzz from critics and streamers, or gain a large enough community to survive the long haul â yes, it had 5 million downloads at launch, but how many stuck around? By August, concurrent player counts were down to below 20,000. Ubisoft repeatedly waved away questions over the gameâs future in the last few months, but clearly reached the conclusion that it wasnât sustainable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/msi-claw-ai-devices-available-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>MSI has released the souped-up Claw AI+ handheld units, unveiling in full the Claw 8 AI+ and the Claw 7 AI+. As the latest entrants into the handheld market, the AI+ devices boast several key innovations thatâll have gamers considering securing one over a close competitor, like the ASUS ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>The larger unit â the Claw 8 AI+ â will cost you a pretty penny, though. MSI has advised that the RRP for this device is $899.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what MSI is doing to make that price point seem worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-msi-claw-ai-is-on-the-market">MSI Claw AI+ Is On The Market</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-s-New-Claw-8-AI----Claw-7-AI--Handheld-with-Powerful-Performance-and-Low-Power-Consumption--Available-Now--145096?utm_source=msi-news-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=msi-news&amp;utm_content=MSI%27s%20New%20Claw%208%20AI%2B%20%26%20Claw%207%20AI%2B%20Handheld%20with%20Powerful%20Performance%20and%20Low%20Power%20Consumption-%20Available%20Now%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new MSI Claw AI+ handhelds</a> utilise Intel Core Ultra 7 processors and Arc graphics, and by all accounts, they boast some of the sharpest handheld gaming experiences available right now.</p>



<p>It might seem like a mid-generation refresh, but the MSI Claw AI+ range is much more.</p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is the pick of the bunch, boasting an 8-inch 1080p 120Hz IPS display that offers crisp visuals and a smooth refresh rate. MSI has claimed that the Claw 8 AI+ offers around 20% better performance than competing devices, like the ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is riddled with tech, thatâs for sure. It features Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast charging, which means the 80Wh battery will go from flat to full in no time at all. It now features hall-effect triggers and the on-board software has received a significant upgrade from MSI.</p>



<p>With 32 GB of RAM, the MSI Claw AI+ range outpaces the ROG Ally X, which totes just 24 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Between the two devices (Claw 8 and Claw 7), there are some major differences. The larger device has a much more powerful battery, and it has better WiFi capabilities â it also weighs 120g more. </p>



<p>MSI has promised a more optimised experience with the in-built AI capabilities of the Claw 8 and Claw 7 devices. Theyâre built with power consumption, visuals, and ergonomics in mind, itâs just up to you if those enhancements are worth the $899 price tag.</p>

<p>Hermen Hulst, one of PlayStationâs CEOs, has spoken to the BBC during the brandâs 30th anniversary. Before diving into the history of the company, Hulst was doorstepped with a question about AI in game development. It has been a sore spot for a while, with some developers leaning much more into AI, sometimes at the cost of human employees.</p>



<p>Hulst assured that while AI has the potential to revolutionise game development, âpreserving the human touchâ is still of the utmost importance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>In an interview with the BBC, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the co-CEOs of PlayStation, spoke about the past, present, and future of the brand.</p>



<p>To open <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, Hermen Hulst spoke about AI in game development, given that he oversees software at Sonyâs gaming giant, while Nishino focuses more on hardware development.</p>



<p>Hulst explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, AI is allowing for extraordinary leaps in the development process, allowing for procedural generation, the likes of which were previously unobtainable. AI is also being used to automate laborious, repetitive, or operationally impactful tasks that might have traditionally slowed down the development workflow.</p>



<p>In others, itâs putting jobs at risk, âstealing identitiesâ, and putting fear into industry workers the world over.</p>



<p>As the interview unfolded, Hulst and Nishino explored the success of Astro Bot, recent leaps into live-action adaptations, and the origins of PlayStation. Nishino laid out a neat anecdote, recalling his motherâs toy store and how he would demo gaming devices for unaware shoppers when the technology was just starting to emerge.</p>



<p>Do you think thereâs a world where AI and human-based game development can exist in sheer harmony? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The production of the second season of Fallout is well underway, and recently, Walton Gogginsâwho plays The Ghoulâappeared on social media to share a brief message. His post went hand-in-hand with a new image showing him in the makeup department having his âghoul skinâ applied.</p>



<p>In Fallout, the live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that aired in April 2024, Goggins plays Cooper âThe Ghoulâ Howard. He stars alongside Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, and his performance in the showâs opening season was nothing short of stellar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-feo-fuerte-y-formal">Feo Fuerte y Formal</h2>



<p>To celebrate his return to the character of The Ghoul, Walton Goggins posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels good to slip back into this skin. I do this shit for the love of the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was referencing a line his character utters in the show, and the image that accompanied the post showed him having a thick layer of prosthetics applied to portray a Fallout âghoulâ, a character warped by radiation.</p>



<p>In April, Fallout debuted on Prime, and it became the biggest launch the platform had ever seen. From there, things skyrocketed for the Fallout franchise. Across the entire suite of games, player counts and investment soared, and titles like Fallout 76 reached new heights, several years after being released.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that the production for the second season of Fallout is moving ahead of schedule, but itâs still likely it wonât surface until 2026. These days, almost every show has a two-year gap between seasons, much to the chagrin of viewers.</p>



<p>For instance, the first season of The Last of Us was released in January 2023, and the second season isnât expected to drop until a few months into 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-surprising-skill-and-weapon-changes-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent behind-closed-doors demo, we played a section of Monster Hunter Wilds and asked the developers about changes made to weapons and other systems, the biggest being the separation of Equipment Skills between weapons and armor. Read on for more details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played the demo, I realized major changes have been made to the Skills system, where damage-increasing skills and weapon-specific skills like Attack Up and Focus can only be found on or applied to the weapons themselves â a pretty impactful change. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Watch new gameplay of Monster Hunter Wilds above, including footage of Seikret and camp customization.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the new Equipment Skill system. In interviews, the dev team referred to skills for your weapons casually as Weapon Skills. Running with that unofficial terminology, letâs call equipment skills for weapons Weapon Skills, and equipment skills for armor Armor Skills. This means that equipment skills in Wilds are split up into these two categories. Weapon Skills generally include skills that affect actions and damage output, while Armor Skills assist in other ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armor Skills include support skills like Speed Eating and Divine Blessing. This new system also affects slots, and the devs confirmed that weapons can only use decorations with skills categorized as Weapon Skills, while armor can only use decorations with skills categorized as Armor Skills.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/weapon-equipment-skills-1733278360038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see this bow has the built-in Equipment Skill "Focus." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This really opens up a lot of new ideas. I asked director Yuya Tokuda about his intentions here, and he replied, âOnly armor had [built-in] equipment skills until now, but when a piece of armor had a type of skill only effective when used with a certain weapon type, that meant you would have to choose the corresponding weapon. This led to an unavoidable situation where it was harder for people to use those kinds of armor pieces.â The new system solves that issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds now lets you take two weapons with you on a hunt, which must have been another reason behind the change. Since you can now swap to a sub-weapon mid-hunt, it's great to be able to keep on hunting while maintaining the skills you need to increase your damage to a suitable level or handle your weapon better.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/armor-equipment-skills-1733278376038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see the Hope Armor Set includes the built-in Equipment Skills "Divine Blessing" and "Stun Resistance." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one thing I'm still curious about. While I was able to confirm that skills like Guard are indeed on weapons that can block, I'm still not sure which type of equipment utilizes skills like Evade and Evade Distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Balance</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is weapon balancing. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto confirmed that there will be significant weapon balance changes in Wilds. He told me, âThere will be major changes not just after what we saw in the open beta, but also in the form of changes we had always intended to add to the final product.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said, âIn particular, we plan on putting quite a lot of work into the Lance, Switch Axe, Insect Glaive, and Sword and Shield based on feedback from the open beta.â</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued, âWe've tweaked values across the board relating to weapon damage and overall balance, including balance regarding endgame content.â In addition to these numerical changes, the four aforementioned weapon types have (quote) âplenty of work put into how they feel to use."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development side is certainly listening to the voices of the players, they were already taking a proactive stance toward weapon balance changes, and it seems that a proper announcement about the topic will come at a later date. Seeing their attitude put me at ease; the game is clearly in good hands. Weâll see how their intentions pan out when the final game is released in February 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the team told me about the direction and concept of the Switch Axe and the Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Insect Glaive Changes and the Return of Vaulting Dance</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Insect Glaive is one of my main weapons, and my very first impression was that there were fewer aerial attacks available. It made me wonder if the concept was to reduce the relative number of aerial attacks and make it a primarily grounded weapon. I brought this up with Tokuda, and he began by revealing to me that Vaulting Dance is making a return! This is one of the actions that was so important to opening up possibilities for aerial combat with an Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why it wasn't there before, Tokuda said, "We were concerned that putting it in this time around would cause players to use nothing but existing movements, rather than focus on the new parts of the game. That's why we decided to remove Vaulting Dance for a time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the reason it was brought back, he replied, "Many players at gamescom and Tokyo Game Show told us that it's not about how strong or weak it is, but that Vaulting Dance is part of the Insect Glaive's very identity. We realized that we weren't on the same page as our players there, and so we immediately decided to bring Vaulting Dance back while balancing the ability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was happy to hear about this balance decision as an Insect Glaive user. That said, I did have difficulty during the open beta with the controls for its new charge attack, and I'm hoping that they'll make it easier to use as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Updating the Switch Axe to be More Attractive to Players</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I then asked about what direction they want to take with the Switch Axe. Tokuda told me the concept of the Switch Axe had not fully gotten across to players, and that the dev team is balancing it in order to convey what makes it a good weapon. Specifically, he said, âThe Full Release Slash that comes at the very end of an attack didn't fully stand out, both in terms of feel and numbers, making it less attractive when compared to similarly positioned attacks for other weapons. We'll be sure to address that." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After hearing about the developers' plans to balance the Switch Axe to make it a more attractive weapon, it's clear to me that it's being properly discussed. Their process to come to the decision to make changes to the Switch Axe backs that up even more, so I don't think that should be a point of concern any longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm sorry to admit that I can't go into as much depth on the Switch Axe as with the Insect Glaive, as it isn't one of my main weapons, but other media outlets were also present at this hands-on session, and Iâm sure some of them include players who go hard on the Lance, the Gunlance, the Bow, the Long Sword and more, so keep an eye out online for more information on your favorite weapon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Translated by Ko Ransom.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if youâve <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard this one before</a>: A major publisher launched a live-service game intended to compete with one of a small handful of industry-eclipsing giants. It did not immediately succeed to the tune of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Now studios are shutting down and workers are getting laid off. Just another Tuesday in the video game industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest victim of whatâs effectively become a cycle is Ubisoftâs <em>XDefiant </em>â or rather, the people who made the recently-released game and, in doing so, followed managementâs ill-advised edict to swipe a slice of pie from <em>Call of Duty</em>âs endlessly mashing maw. By many measures, the free-to-play shooter, which featured factions from a veritable <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rainbow of wrung-dry IPs</a> like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>, was solid, a "perfect antidote to those tired of <em>Call of Duty</em>âs modern-day bloat," <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/behind-its-identikit-theme-and-terrible-name-xdefiant-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-those-tired-of-call-of-dutys-modern-day-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to PC Gamer</a>. But as weâve seen time and time again, âsolidâ doesnât convince millions of people to abandon habits and communities theyâve spent years building up in whichever game rules the roost.&nbsp;</p><p>âSolid,â at best, inspires brief curiosity, which is why executive producer Mark Rubin was <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today able to boast</a> that âwe broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our gameâ while the Ubisoft mothership declared that itâs pulling the plug on the game, shutting down studios in San Francisco and Osaka, planning to âramp downâ another studio in Sydney, and potentially lay off hundreds of workers.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the discontinuation of <em>XDefiant </em>brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game," Ubisoft chief studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert wrote in <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the company's official site</a>. "Even if almost half of the <em>XDefiant </em>team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."</p><p>This masterpiece in refusing to name the parties responsible â Where are the âdifficult consequences for teams working on the gameâ coming from, de Waubert? Who is making these decisions? Certainly not the workers themselves â harks back to similarly grim ends met by <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Redfall</em></a>, as well as unannounced games from companies like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/microsoft-cancels-big-new-blizzard-game-after-six-years-of-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studios-head-confirms-projects-cancelled-in-wake-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> that never even got the chance to launch and face off against their genreâs respective entrenched boogeymen.&nbsp;</p><p>The triple-A strategy of trying to muscle in on the turf of giants with just a brand portfolio and a dream, only to throw up your hands when you donât strike gold after a few months, is a dead end. The Ubisofts of the world cannot keep doing this. And yet:</p><p>âDeveloping games-as-a-service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy,â wrote de Waubert, citing successful series like<em> Rainbow Six</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, and <em>For Honor</em>, the most recent of which began in 2017, all of which arguably tried to do something unique, and all of which were given actual time to find their footing. âItâs a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with <em>XDefiant </em>to our future live titles.â</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the shutdown, the publisher plans to shut down its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief Studios and Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert revealed the news in an email sent to Ubisoft employees that was subsequently posted online, saying that the shooter was "not able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full message can be found below.</p><blockquote>Today, I wanted to share with you that weâve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite an encouraging start, the teamâs passionate work, and a committed fan base, weâve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it.</blockquote><blockquote>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiantâs active players.</blockquote><blockquote>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition.</blockquote><blockquote>Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy, and weâve achieved significant successes, like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor, among others. Itâs a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles.</blockquote><blockquote>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates.</blockquote><blockquote>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin also shared a message thanking fans and saying he was "heartbroken." He also shared refund details, saying that any purchases made within the last 30 days will be fully refunded and that those who purchases the Ultimate Founder's Pack will also get their money back. Refunds should happen automatically with 8 weeks, he said.</p><blockquote>I am unfortunately here today to announce that XDefiant will be shutting down. Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date TBD) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.<p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founderâs Pack, youâll receive a full refund. Players who made any purchases within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. Those refunds should happen automatically within 8 weeks of today and you can find more details on our official website, <a href="https://t.co/pNWQ3cifIZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://XDefiant.com</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, Ubisoft and the SF Dev team embarked on a bold adventure to develop a new arcade shooter called XDefiant. It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) while bringing back a more âold-schoolâ arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the Dev team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. Itâs a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post.  Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when XDefiant launched was amazingâwe broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If thereâs one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, itâs the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This âplayer-firstâ mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made XDefiant so special. From my very first post about XDefiant, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around XDefiant. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,</p><p>Mark</p></blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant joins Concord <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">as the latest service game to abruptly shutter</a> not long after launch. Unlike Concord, though, XDefiant will be given a bit of grace, with its servers not due to shut down until June 3, 2025. Ubisoft also plans to go forward with releasing Season 3, though downloads and purchases will no longer be available.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hello XDefiant Fans,</p><p>I am unfortunately here today to announce that XDefiant will be shutting down.</p><p>Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available.

Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale"><em>Hyper Scape</em></a> before it, <em>XDefiant</em> had high expectations, with Ubisoft touting more than 1 million players in its closed beta last year. Now, it will disappear quickly, as itâs no longer accepting new players as of today and is <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">scheduled to shut off the servers</a> entirely next June.</p><p>Despite a delayed launch, Ubisoft said that <em>XDefiant </em>had reached more than 10 million players in its first two weeks and âoutperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per session day.â However, it couldnât maintain that momentum, and by this fall, rumors of trouble surfaced, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reporting that concurrent player numbers across all platforms had fallen below 20,000.</p><p>Ubisoft states, âThe game will remain available to all players who joined <em>XDefiant </em>before December 3rd, 2024. All functionalities, including progression, events, rewards, and achievements, will continue to be available until June 3rd, 2025.â The planned Season 3 content will still launch, and the company is refunding anyone who bought the Ultimate Founders Pack, as well as players who bought VC and DLC in the last month.</p><p>Like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em></a> developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>, this shutdown comes with job losses. According to Ubisoft, âdifficult consequencesâ are leading to âthe closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.â</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date to be determined) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.</p><p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founderâs Pack, youâll receive a full refund. Players who made any purchases within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. Those refunds should happen automatically within 8 weeks of today and you can find more details on our official website, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDefiant</em>.com</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, Ubisoft and the [San Francisco] development team embarked on a bold <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,901 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> to develop a new <a title="Genres > Arcade [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,942 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> called <em>XDefiant</em>. It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking while bringing back a more âold-schoolâ arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the development team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [340 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play games</a> take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. Itâs a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post. Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when <em>XDefiant</em> launched was amazingâwe broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass five million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If thereâs one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, itâs the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This âplayer-firstâ mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made <em>XDefiant</em> so special. From my very first post about <em>XDefiant</em>, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around <em>XDefiant</em>. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,<br>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A month and a half after denying reports it was poised to pull the plug on its free-to-play live-service shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> - which launched back in May - Ubisoft has confirmed it's doing just that, resulting in the closure of three production studios and 277 employees losing their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's chief Studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">announced the end of XDefiant's development in a post on the company's website</a>. "Despite an encouraging start," de Waubert explained, "the team's passionate work, and a committed fan base, we've not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market."
</p>
<p>
"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment," de Waubert continued, "and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it." As such, new downloads, player registrations, and purchases will no longer be available from today, but Season 3 will launch as planned and servers will remain online until 3rd June, 2025.

<p>
Unfortunately, the news doesn't end with XDefiant's cancellation. Ubisoft has also confirmed it's closing its San Francisco and Osaka production studios, and will "ramp down" its Sydney production site. As a result, 277 employees across all three units will lose their jobs. This equates to a little over half of the XDefiant team worldwide, with Ubisoft noting other employees working on the project will transition elsewhere within the company.
</p>
<p>
"To those team members leaving Ubisoft," de Waubert continued in her statement. "I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/2wPUTEuXKpVoCvINTcxvGR/xdefiant-a-message-to-our-community">message</a> to the XDefiant community, executive producer Mark Rubin - who in October insisted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xdefiant-will-not-shut-down-after-season-four-executive-producer-insists">there were "no plans" to shut down the game</a> - wrote, "Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It's a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue."
</p><p>
The announcement comes at a turbulent time for Ubisoft, which has been dogged by underperforming titles, delays, and project cancellations over the last few years. In an emergency investor call held at the start of 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">announced considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a>, leading to the cancellation of three unannounced projects and a programme of "targeted restructuring" that resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">series of layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the publisher has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancelled The Division: Heartland</a> after more than three years of work, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows' release into next year</a> following a "softer than expected launch" for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.

			<p>Realistically, this news doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. Considering the huge amount of hot water Ubisoft is in right now, with the troubles only seeming to continue in quantity and significance, it's not too much of a surprise that XDefiant is officially closing down. Several sources have revealed this information to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, which is where it was first reported. The news came in an internal all-hands meeting that took place today. Ubisoft has decided to shut down the game because of poor player numbers and a lack of player spending. This is something that Ubisoft has commented on multiple times themselves, especially in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">their financial reports</a>. Times for Ubisoft have been particularly difficult as of late, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't launch the way they were hoping and didn't bring in as much revenue as they lied. In addition to that, they now have XDefiant as a sinking ship, with a lot of people being very uncertain about Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was delayed to next year.</p>
<p>Due to XDefiant closing down, it's said that there will be a significant number of employees laid off from the San Francisco studio as well as supporting studios, with some of the staff already receiving their severance information. Ubisoft is set to experience another wave of layoffs in February, as the San Francisco studio will be closing its doors completely. It's not said whether the staff working there will be relocated to work elsewhere within the company or if they've been let go completely.</p>
<p>Season 3 of XDefiant will be the last full season of the game, with a skeleton crew continuing to work on the game until June 2025, which is when the game will be sunsetted.</p>
<p>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer on XDefiant made a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy statement on X</a> today, announcing that the servers for the game will remain active until June 3, 2025. Any players who purchased the Ultimate Founder's Pack will be refunded. Additionally, any players who made any sort of purchase in the game within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded and this will happen automatically within 8 weeks.</p>
<p>As of today, new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available, and the game will only be available to those who were previously playing it and had registered or downloaded the game prior. All information about the closure is listed on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official XDefiant website</a>.</p>

That means its startup noise, which eternally rings in the minds of people of A Certain Age like our own personal Big Ben, is also getting up there in years. And yet, today I learned something new about it. Well, new to me.</p><p>According to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSd30d7JzM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video from YouTuber Nitrocosm</a> (brought to my attention by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/janus.bsky.social/post/3lcg5lnhcp22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath pal and freelance contributor Janus Rose</a>), the PS1 startup noise is not one sound, but three. On top of that, theyâre stored directly in the PS1âs BIOS â firmware that contains basic software for booting the console and running games&nbsp; â which explains why theyâre chopped up and individually modified instead of lumped together into a single file: The BIOS is just 512 kilobytes. Todayâs vast audio libraries would make it melt like the mind of a Victorian peasant experiencing a single crumb of Dorito dust.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Playstation Startup Sound Explained" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkSd30d7JzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The three audio samples are: 1) a chime, 2) a synth sound with a phaser effect on it, and 3) a reverse tape sound effect. These, according to Nitrocosm, are played at different speeds and mixed together to create the final product. If you want to hear the original sounds in all their individual glory, you can watch the video.</p><p>This is, I imagine, a far cry from how the sound effect is generated on the PlayStation 5, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/488901/playstation-anniversary-aesthetics-graphics-sounds-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added a nostalgia-laden startup sequence</a> to celebrate the 30-year anniversary. But Iâll never get tired of appreciating instances in which constraints bred creativity and limitations led to something that stuck with us for decades. We must, if nothing else, respect the old ways. We wouldnât be here without them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Several sources have revealed that Ubisoft will be shutting down XDefiant in June 2025.</p>



<p>The news was mentioned in an internal all-hands meeting today. The decision was made due to poor player numbers and a lack of player spending, according to sources familiar with the decision to sunset the game.</p>



<p>Itâs understood that layoffs will impact a significant number of employees at the San Francisco studio and supporting studios, with some staff already receiving severance information. Another wave of layoffs will happen in February, with Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka closing its doors. Around 170-180 people are understood to be losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Season 3 will be the last entire season of XDefiant, with a skeleton crew maintaining the title until June 2025. According to those familiar with the situation, Ubisoft will be updating XDefiant players on refunds for cosmetic items and other purchases at a later date.</p>

<p>XDefiant started its uphill battle soon after the release of Season 1, with a lack of player spending having the team scrabbling to cut costs. </p>



<p>In August 2024, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was on borrowed time</a> despite initially having strong player numbers. Frustrations within the studio were always aimed at its leadership, who refused to take responsibility for the projectâs shortcomings, which could have been avoided with a better studio culture, said the people.</p>



<p>In late March 2024, I&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on the studioâs toxic work culture</a>, and despite an internal investigation that concluded last month, I&nbsp;was told that the issues had been swept under the rug and that its problems were still prevalent.</p>

            <p>
We're less than a week away from Indiana Jones' next big adventure - in which the boulder-bothering, grail-quaffing archaeologist goes in search a big old circle - and ahead of its release, developer MachineGames has revealed PC requirements and, as a bonus, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq97d1RkdRM">new trailer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Great Circle in question (it's in the title, so probably relatively important as the story proceeds), is, as game director Jerk Gustafsson <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview/">previously explained</a>, "very real and mysterious". It just so happens to connect many historical sites such as Giza, Easter Island, Sukhothai, and Nazca as it runs around the Earth's circumference, and nobody has ever figured out why. Except, probably, Indiana Jones in about a week's time.
</p>
<p>
And if you're a PC player considering joining Indy on his globe-trotting, first-person adventure, MachineGames has now detailed exactly what hardware you'll need to have stuffed inside your computer to ensure it runs at a satisfactory level. In all cases, you'll be wanting to free up 120GB of storage, with full specs detailed at the bottom of this page.

<p>
As noted over on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3Od8RFBcAOGNxNDlD801Rp/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-specs">Bethesda's blog</a>, Indy potentially comes in a little smaller on Xbox, with its basic installation size weighing in at roughly 87GB. However, there's an optional 45GB Higher Resolution Textures pack that's installed by default on Xbox Series X.
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launches for Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on Monday, 9th December, but it'll be playable from 6th December for anyone that pre-orders the Premium Edition, Premium Edition Upgrade, or Collectorâs Edition - you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-the-great-circle-release-times">specific release times over here</a>. As for PlayStation 5 owners, it'll be available on Sony's console in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ian Higton positively vibrated with excitement when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">went hands-on with the Great Circle</a> back in October.
