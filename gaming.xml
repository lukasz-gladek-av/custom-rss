In fact, the fourth game in the franchise only imports three choices from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, a stark departure from its predecessor which used a whole separate app to let you craft a world state based on hundreds of previous decisions. While that limitation lingers over <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare says this shouldn’t signal to fans that choices from games as far back as the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> can’t factor into a future game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The final game only implements three decisions specifically regarding the Inquisitor, the protagonist of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. These choices mainly end up affecting a few lines of dialogue, and meanwhile, <em>The Veilguard </em>goes out of its way to avoid actually addressing anything else the player may have done in previous games. Every returning character’s dialogue is written in a way that they could have feasibly ended up where they do in the sequel regardless of whatever choices you may have made. Some minutiae falls through the cracks, like Isabela talking as if she joined the player in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, when it was possible to play that game without recruiting her. But broadly, BioWare chose to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">take more care to not contradict players’ choices</a></span> than to represent them. This was a far cry from the studio’s previous work, and while I appreciate the care the team took to not step on toes, I think most fans were surprised to find something that felt so severed from previous games, especially as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story ties up so many loose ends from across the franchise.</p><p>The studio has said that it planned on using the geographical distance between the events of the southern regions of Thedas in previous games and the northern setting of <em>The Veilguard</em> to get narrative distance. However, Busche explained to <em>IGN </em>that just because a decision from <em>Origins</em>, <em>DAII</em>, or <em>Inquisition</em> didn’t factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, that doesn’t mean it can’t be imported in a future game.</p><p>“The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it,” Busche said. “One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn’t necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn’t mean they’re gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what’s happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to <em>Dragon Age Origins</em> will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their <em>Dragon Age</em> journey, those are still your choices. And if you’ve seen the secret 2D ending we talked about, some of these events being quite pertinent. It’s easy to see how those choices can and will be relevant into the future.”</p><p>While a hypothetical <em>Dragon Age 5</em> is years away at this point, what we do know about the future of the series implies that old choices could be more relevant down the road. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439">secret ending</a></span> in particular has ramifications for the whole franchise, rather than just that game, so I could see BioWare circling around to older game decisions while plotting the series’ path forward. Will it be enough to make up for <em>The Veilguard</em>’s relative disconnect? We’ll see in a few years, as for now, BioWare has pivoted its focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">next <em>Mass Effect </em>game</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It would be a simple, harmless error if wicked.com didn’t direct people to Wicked Pictures, a pornographic production studio that’s been around for over 30 years (and has had that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=Wicked.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website domain</a></span> for just as long). The lawsuit, filed by South Carolina mom Holly Ricketson, alleges that on or around November 11, she purchased one of those <em>Wicked </em>dolls for her young daughter and was shocked when her child showed her the Wicked.com site which, she says, “pasted scenes of pornographic advertisements across her phone screen.”</p><p>She claims her child was exposed to full-on nude sex scenes. Mattel issued a recall of the dolls but didn’t offer a refund. By explicitly advertising the toys to children aged as young as four, the lawsuit alleges the company neglected its duty to produce an appropriate product, packaging and all.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the toy giant didn’t directly address the lawsuit, it did argue that erroneously including a porn website on its packaging “in no way impacts the value or play experience provided by the product itself in the limited number of units sold before the correction.”</p><p>While Mattel appears to want to separate the packaging from the actual product, in terms of what the company is actually selling to children, there may be another way out of culpability.<strong> </strong>When you visit wicked.com, the first image you get is an age gate prompt that explains how the content on the page is restricted and only intended for viewing by those 18 years of age or older, with no pornographic images visible. Let’s say her child aimlessly clicked “enter,” as we all do when provided with a list of terms and conditions that could literally involve us consenting to giving our data to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI overlords</a></span> for all we know. When I checked (for purely journalistic reasons), no advertisements flashed on my screen, and everyone depicted on the home page was fully clothed, even if they were scantily clad. It’s possible the child could have continued clicking through screens in search of <em>Wicked</em> content, and eventually stumbled upon the type of content her mother alleges she was exposed to on the site. But, this might be a case of principle vs practicality where, to the mom, the fact her child was directed to a site that contained pornography trumped the possibility<strong> </strong>that her child maybe didn’t “immediately” show her mom when she got on the site, as the lawsuit claims,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and rather showed her mom the results of her going through the site on her own. </p><p>Even with the doll recall happening 11 days before the movie debuted, the Broadway adaptation still raked in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-wicked-shatters-expectations-gladiator-2-starts-strong-1236221979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$114 million</a></span> at the box office in the United States alone in its opening weekend. With a <em>Wicked Part II </em>set to hit theaters next year, Mattel should definitely invest in a spell check to save itself any future legal headaches, and prevent the possibility of minors stumbling upon porn. Just a thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-review.1052100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is so much to do in Infinity Nikki – so much that it can sometimes be overwhelming. It's not long after you learn to run and jump that you're introduced to multiple in-game currencies, countless menus, and an abundance of color. Then, there are the outfits: hundreds of adorable clothing pieces, accessories, and makeup options across its beautiful fantasy world. A lot of that is inherent to the Nikki games, a dress-up gacha series that was previously mobile-only. It has the saccharine visuals, outfits ranging from the basic to the fantastical, and the trademark positivity mixed with occasional melancholy in its story. However, Infinity Nikki not only makes the jump to PC and consoles (alongside mobile), it does so while also transitioning from the static dress-up menus of its predecessors to an impressive open world packed to the brim with varied locations to explore, countless items to collect, and charming characters to befriend. It's rare to see a series make such a huge leap, but Infinity Nikki has somehow done so with grace, landing firmly on two feet clad in a pair of sparkling heels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going back to 2012, Nikki games have always been about building out a wardrobe and dressing up the pink-haired (by default) Nikki in any way you choose. Previous entries would have you move from chapter to chapter, compete in styling contests, and gather clothes and accessories – but that was done largely by navigating 2D menus, not running around a 3D map. She’s always accompanied by her best friend and traveling companion, a brash talking cat named Momo, and there’s some dense high-fantasy lore that sometimes introduces strangely high stakes for a game about cute clothes. That’s a quaint formula designed to counteract reality by relying on hyper-girly aesthetics and the simple joy of putting on an amazing outfit and admiring it in the mirror, and while Infinity Nikki shares the same ethos, it expands it into a sandbox world that feels as vast and full as adventure games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Infinity Nikki Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Miraland, the fantasy world where much of the Nikki series takes place, is lush and colorful. Every element is designed to be as twee as possible. Flowers glow and NPCs greet you with enthusiasm. It rains, but it never gets gloomy. Even the enemies are designed to be unassuming, with the most threatening I've encountered in my 20+ hours being a giant walking boulder. You don't even "fight" these enemies; instead you non-violently "purify" them with a ball of energy. Nikki herself goes about her business essentially unthreatened – she can get damaged, but she'll always wake up safe and sound at the nearest fast-travel point if she runs out of health, and regenerates it quickly when out of combat. (I had to test this, because I never actually died.) If I didn't know better, I'd think every character subsists on a diet of frosting-coated ice cream cake covered in sprinkles. That's how sugary the world feels — though there are also little bits of ruin sneaking into its corners, like in the Queen's Palace at the start or the story about war and refugees that’s expertly peppered in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki's incredibly varied but usually bubbly style is most apparent in its clothing. Nikki truly looks stunning all the time, and developer Infold Games has put immense detail into every outfit. In close-ups, you can practically see each stitch and rhinestone, and when she runs or hops, the way her clothes sway looks just like real fabric. Once I unlocked the ethereal Crystal Poems outfit, which is available through gacha pulls and makes Nikki look like a winter princess, I almost never took it off. Even less premium outfits like the maid-inspired Gentle Meowmur or ability outfit Whispering Bubbles add flair to Nikki's movement. Sometimes it's worth floating down from a high platform just to watch the dress flow in the air.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Developer Infold Games has put immense detail into every outfit.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a safe bet that any Nikki game would try to make its outfits shine, but Infinity Nikki puts that same quality of cuteness everywhere else, too. For example, Miraland's various fauna are fluffy, round, and sometimes given absurd names. There are the standards here, like regular horses, but then one breed of dog looks like a pomeranian and is officially called a Floof. An unlockable ability outfit lets you gently groom these critters to collect their fluff and feathers for crafting — Nikki isn't out to skin or pluck a creature in this world. Each animal gets a short wash and their own unique, aggressively cute animation when you do; Floofs roll over for tummy rubs, while bunnies let you clean their long ears and feet. I won't lie, there were many squeals coming from my office as I played. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether this tone works for you or not will become apparent as soon as you boot up Infinity Nikki for the first time. As it compiles shaders on the main menu (which it annoyingly had to do each time I opened the PC launcher), your eyes will be bombarded by what feels like every color on the visible spectrum during a montage of moments you'll eventually encounter, and that's all before your ears pick up the flamboyantly perky original theme song by artist Jessie J. It's definitely a lot, but it's all in fitting service of a game that you can put in the dictionary alongside the word "delightful." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the Nikki games have never been one-note on this front. Infinity Nikki's theme song sounds like a typical anime opening out of Sailor Moon or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review"><u>Super Mario Odyssey's</u></a> "Jump Up, Super Star," but it's counterbalanced by music that changes as you travel throughout the world. The main score features poppy piano, but moving to the fishing area of the first town brings out a folksy guitar. The story is similarly all over the place, and one moment can have the always optimistic and soft-spoken Nikki using her outfits and styling prowess to help people with problems like taking a picture of a flower, and the next she’s dressing up like a police officer to interrogate a suspect in a vast conspiracy involving false wishes putting people into comas for some nefarious purpose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This emotional whiplash between light and dark isn't anything new for the Nikki series, but it works particularly well in Infinity Nikki because it helped make me care about a fantasy story with a tough-to-follow mythos, magic based on wishing, and plenty of proper nouns like Miracle Outfit, Heart of Purity, and Esseling to keep track of. It's also great for a laugh; I'm not sure why a town is asking a young, pink-haired girl they just met to interrogate a prisoner, but it's just absurd enough to keep me entertained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only distraction from this setup are the bugs I ran into ahead of launch. Audio cuts out over time or doesn’t come in at all, and there were a few areas where I accidentally fell through the floor and had to relaunch from the desktop. An update that rolled out during the review period even broke stylist contests so they would cause a crash instead of activating, hindering my progress after a certain point. With a game of this size, there are bound to be issues, but the important part is that none of the ones I saw took away from my overall enjoyment – your goals are so open ended and there's so much here that I always had more than enough to happily keep me busy even if I wasn't able to continue the main story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Explore to Find the Horses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki sucks you in with a world just <em>packed</em> with things to do that reveal themselves masterfully over dozens and dozens of hours. You start off in some ruins outside the town of Florawish, where you'll quickly wander through fields collecting items for crafting before walking around the main square and chatting with various characters. Soon, you'll learn about Whimstars, special items scattered around the world that allow you to work your way through Nikki’s skill tree. Some are simply in hard-to-reach places and require you to do a little platforming, but others will be disguised as animals you need to successfully groom, blocked by enemies you must purify, or locked behind various simple but sometimes time-consuming puzzles you have to solve. And that's not even going into collecting the main currency, called Blings, purifying Dews of Inspiration that you can turn in for special outfits, or just… exploring for the sake of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki is at its best — aside from its fashion, of course — in how it lures you from the beaten path. As I’m riding my bike (yes, there is also biking!) around the map, I have to stop every five seconds to check out something in the distance. I've gotten lost purifying monsters, petting horses, exploring caves, or just finding out if that conspicuously big leaf is actually a trampoline and, if so, what I will find when I jump on it. This may look like other open-world fantasy games, but little touches like the satisfyingly floaty double jump or objects like bouncy nets let you explore in a slightly different way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With no deadlines or level gating, you're free to do whatever you want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You could spend hours running around the starting area of Florawish or the fields and caves right outside it, but venturing elsewhere is always worth it. For example, I initially thought that the only dogs in this land were Floofs, but heading to the rival town of Stoneville introduced me to Bowlers, which are huge off-brand Saint Bernards. You'll also find different enemies that'll reward new crafting supplies, new bugs like Witzles (which you can only find in ruins and breakable crates) to catch, and, if you're interested, new lore. There's even a train-based mission that you'll only find much later on, and it’s one of the notable moments where Infinity Nikki successfully switches up the tone from upbeat to spooky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could skip all this in-depth exploration, too (not that you should). Following just the main quests as they come in means you won't unlock things like the bicycle or find certain crafting items for a long time since they're tied to certain locations, but because Infinity Nikki is so loose with when you need to complete objectives, you could make these discoveries out of order or whenever you want. In fact, you could theoretically travel straight to the area on your map where you can rent a bike, which lets you get to new towns more easily, before you get the quest telling you to do so. There are no deadlines and nothing like the level gating of an RPG open world, so you're truly free to do whatever you want. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll even get the joy of exploration through Infinity Nikki's menus. Yes, really. The tutorials lead you through the basics, such as using your handy tablet called a Pear-Pal (get it?), but you'll discover even more over time by clicking around the menus after completing a task. That's how I realized you can upgrade Momo's camera by capturing photos of specific locations to fill up a photo book. The photo mode is initially basic, but unlocking skills in one of three trees in the camera menu gives it new features like filters and poses that make it more fun to experiment with. I was probably a dozen hours into my playthrough before I learned that (you get that pro-tip for free!) and realizing something like this can be frustrating since it feels like you've unknowingly missed out on potential boosts or rewards, but since you're never forced to do anything specific, that feeling goes away quickly. And, to its credit, this gradual rollout of features keeps Infinity Nikki fresh over a longer period of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A Mobile Game Through and Through</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being on both consoles and PC, Infinity Nikki is still a free-to-play mobile game at heart. And like many of its ilk, it has lots of different currencies to spend across many different menus — so much so that it can be hard to keep track of what you need for something and then where to turn it in once you get it. I often had to randomly click through multiple menus before I found the one I was actually looking for, and I'm sure that's not an uncommon experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buried within them are even more things to do, where you can obtain <em>even more</em> currencies by turning in quests or completing tasks. Unless you read their flavor text and instructions closely, you might not even know what these goals entail – you just know that doing <em>something</em> will reward you with experience, Diamonds, resources, or maybe an entirely new currency you've never encountered before. All the menus are either in your Pear-Pal or on the UI at the top of the screen, and a red dot will notify you when there's a reward to claim, so thankfully you don't actually need to know how anything works right away to make forward progress. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You're always earning <em>something </em>just by playing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, there are weekly tasks you can fulfill to get experience in Mira's Journey, which is just a fancy name for Infinity Nikki's battle pass. As in other free-to-play games, there are two levels to it: a free one that'll net you some rewards, and a premium one that'll reward you even more, including special outfits and premium currency. The Mira’s Journey available during the review period was called Distant Anthem, and it didn't feature a lot on the premium track to tempt me to buy it beyond a new cloak for Momo at level 30 and another when completing it fully. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather confusingly,<em> </em>your Mira's Journey levels are <em>not </em>the same as your Mira Level. Free-to-play mobile games are always inundating you with things like this, each with their own unique objectives and rewards, because it keeps you clicking around even when there's nothing to do. It also ensures you're always earning <em>something </em>by playing, even if it's just a couple bits of currency or, in the case of Infinity Nikki, basic crafting supplies. For example, there are Daily Wishes, where completing five out of six objectives will net you some goodies, but you'll fill them out easily enough just by playing like normal. It takes no effort on your part, and you still get a treat – and Infinity Nikki gets a few more menu clicks out of you. This isn’t a highlight of Infinity Nikki, but it is par for the course in this genre.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best open-world games to ignore the story</h3><p>Open-world games that are at their best when you wander around ignoring the main story.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, if you thought the menus were tough to keep straight, the countless currencies are even trickier. Bling is the main one and can easily be obtained either by picking up floating, glowing crystals while wandering around the world or by completing quests. Diamonds are a premium currency used to purchase special outfits or unlock Resonite Crystals, which are then used for the gacha that gets you other cosmetics. Spend a Shard and you can pull from a pool of clothing and accessories to hopefully obtain the individual pieces that make up four incredibly fantastical five-star outfits. Pulling three-star duplicates grants you 10 Tranquility Drops, which… quite frankly, took me <em>far </em>too much menu digging to even find out they were used in a "Pity" system to not punish you as much for duplicate pulls. Finally, Stellarite is purchased with real-world money and can be used to buy Diamonds and other exclusive outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There might be too many currencies, but it's all in service of Infinity Nikki's endgame: collecting as many outfits as possible, whether it's with real money or not. That means it's time to talk about the dreaded M-word: microtransactions. After a decade of perfecting the mobile Nikki gacha systems, Infold didn't have to innovate much to implement the same thing here. Infinity Nikki's microtransaction strategy simply takes advantage of your FOMO (fear of missing out): You can craft and pick up plenty of stunning, intricate outfits without ever spending a dime, but the <em>coolest </em>outfits will always either cost money or be in the gacha pool. Spending real-world money can also help you fill up your wardrobe faster – sure, you can complete a steampunk lolita outfit by turning in Dews of Inspiration, but that's time consuming. Why not just dump Diamonds into Resonite, or purchase the outfit of your dreams outright? At the time of this writing, the most expensive outfit costs 2,980 Stellarite, which is slightly less than $50. Things can quickly get out of control for your wallet if you don't "budget wisely," as the Infinity Nikki store reminds you at the top of the menu.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Plenty of stunning outfits are free, but the <em>coolest </em>ones cost money.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Importantly, none of the outfits you can win from a pack or nab with a lucky pull are required if you want to move forward in the story or exploration of Infinity Nikki. Getting a fancy outfit might make it easier to win stylist encounters, which ask you to earn the most points you can by meeting specific prompts with the clothes you wear, but those are pretty easy to succeed at without them in my experience. In Love Nikki and Shining Nikki, purchasing more elaborate clothing options or accessories could help you against other players in PvP styling competitions, but there isn’t any multiplayer here beyond leaving little photography impressions for other players to find and a friend system (although Infold could always add more down the line). It's all for you, which makes resisting the temptation to spend a little easier. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as in any respectable free-to-play game, spending real money is not something you <em>have </em>to do in Infinity Nikki, which should allay any worries about unfairness. However, some of these outfits do still cost a lot of real-world cash if you decide to pay up, which can start to feel exploitative either way. It's also tough to say how obnoxious these systems will be in practice, as the review copy came with an unrealistically large amount of both Diamonds and Bling so that we could test out everything Infinity Nikki had to offer, but that also makes it trickier to say how this economy will fare over time. Free-to-play games often make it easy to gain premium currency in the beginning and then slow it down as you get further in, and that was always the case in the other Nikki games. But even if you don’t spend a dime, it’s easy to have at least a few dozen hours of excellent exploration and adventure for free in Infinity Nikki before you’ll even start to consider walking away.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-announced-during-naraka-fest-2024.1052091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-during-naraka-fest-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Highlights include a new hero and details about upcoming collaborations.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Naraka Fest has come and gone, and we got lots of info about what’s on the horizon for Naraka: Bladepoint. There’s a new hero, collab events, and upcoming world championship, and we have all the details about everything announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most immediate bit of news relates to the collaboration with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which had been teased during the Naraka Fest Direct in June. The collab is already here — it launched on December 4 and added four characters from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Geralt, Triss, Yennefer, and Ciri are now available as skins for Tarka Ji, Cyra, Valda Cui, and Shayol Wei. During the collab, you’ll also be able to earn tokens that can be traded for in-game items.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/the-witcher-3-cover-1733273924534.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The next big reveal was the announcement of a new hero: Lannie, a wandering street performer who is skilled with traditional Chinese magic tricks. She’s a talented singer and storyteller who can perform different types of traditional Chinese folk arts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She has a unique skill set in combat that focuses on the cloth she carries and the magic tricks she can do with it. She can repel enemies with the cloth and disappear into it, performing a vanishing act that lets her escape. Or she can jump into her cloth, dash quickly, and release a special attack that can send enemies flying. You’ll have the chance to try her out for yourself when she joins the game in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the collab with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the most imminent, Naraka Fest also announced two more future collabs. One is with The King of Fighters, the fighting game series that’s been going strong for 30 years. Classic characters from the series will join Naraka: Bladepoint in the form of new hero outfits when the collab launches in early 2025.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/1733123568069-1733274069781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping with the brawler theme, Naraka: Bladepoint will also collab with real-life champion Buakaw Banchamek. He's regarded as one of the best Muay Thai fighters of all time, with several championships to his name. The collab will add authentic motion-captured moves from Banchamek, and players can complete missions that reward tokens which can be used to summon Banchamek in-game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/j-cup-1733274120688.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but not least, for esports fans, we got details about the upcoming J-Cup World Championship. It will return on December 14–15 and will feature the best Naraka: Bladepoint players from around the world. This year’s tournament will take place in Changsha, China, where the top 12 players will face off for the title. You’ll be able to watch the action live on Naraka: Bladepoint’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NARAKABLADEPOINT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/narakabladepoint" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@narakabladepoint?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok</u></a> channels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Future updates adding new characters, maps, and gameplay features will be free as well, NetEase emphasized.</p><p dir="ltr">Like most shooters, Marvel Rivals will include seasonal battle passes. However, unlike most games in the genre, purchased battle passes won't expire at the end of a season. Players will instead be able to continue making progress on old battle passes after the end of a season, much like the battle pass system in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For the game's initial Season 0, the battle pass will be half the size of a standard battle pass due to the season's shorter length. It will also cost half as much to compensate. Standard battle passes will be roughly $10, with the shorter Season 0 battle pass costing around $5. The premium (or Luxury, as Marvel Rivals calls it) Season 0 battle pass will include five costumes and various other cosmetics, while the free version will grant one epic-quality costume and some other freebies.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase said other free cosmetics can be earned via achievements and various events. Units can be earned for free from completing achievements or participating in events and used to purchase cosmetics. Units are also included in the Luxury battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The Overwatch-inspired shooter recently revealed a flurry of new characters, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-wolverine-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-best-there-is/2300-6465532/" data-ref-id="2300-6465532">Wolverine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-squirrel-girl-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-the-unbeatable/2300-6465520/" data-ref-id="2300-6465520">Squirrel Girl</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-black-widow-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-super-spy-sniper/2300-6465525/" data-ref-id="2300-6465525">Black Widow</a>.

<p>IllFonic, the developers behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, have announced that its the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/IllFonic/status/1864369606988632330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt said that the layoffs are an acceptance of the “harsh reality” within the games industry.</p>



<p>“Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic,” he said. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy.”</p>







<p>In addition to developing its own games, Illfonic has provided support development for games like Crysis 3 and Star Citizen. Coincidentally enough, the latter’s developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games recently held</a> its own layoffs.</p>



<p>There was no specific mention of how many people have been let go. According to <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/illfonic/5a1da50f2300005a0097c01e#:~:text=As%20of%20October%202024%2C%20IllFonic,including%20North%20AmericaEuropeAsia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeadIQ</a>, Illfonic employed 96 people as of October 2024.</p>



<p>To close his statement, Brungardt requested that those with openings reach out to him in order to help place those who have lost their jobs.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

                <p>After a nearly 10-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> finally arrived at the end of October. While the previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, is now regarded as a classic in the genre, The Veilguard's reception has been considerably colder from some. That's something that the developers behind The Veilguard have already come to terms with.</p><p>"It's been a decade since the last Dragon Age game came out, and a lot of people have spent that decade imagining various versions of what this game was going to be," said Dragon Age creative director John Epler during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations."</p><p>The long development of The Veilguard included a period where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">the sequel was re-envisioned as a live-service game</a> before it transitioned back to a single-player experience. Given everything that went into the game, director Corinne Busche shared her satisfaction with The Veilguard in its final form.</p><p>"We're very happy with the critical reception to the game," said Busche. "It's not common to have these challenging development cycles and have a team turn around and receive the critical reception that it did. In fact, in a lot of ways, that is the harder path to take. So yeah, we're quite proud of the critical reception. Unfortunately on the sales side, that's not something we can really discuss. but of course as we know with Inquisition, that was a long burn to get to those total sales numbers."</p><p>EA has already stated that The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">won't be getting a DLC expansion</a> because BioWare is shifting gears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. However, Busche expressed confidence in the future of the Dragon Age franchise.</p><p>"There's so many stories left, so many mysteries left unsolved, so I'll leave that for what it is," related Busche. "I will remain of the point of view that [Dragon Age's ability to reinvent itself] remains our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity."</p>

future, but the team decided it was best to stick to the 2024 release date. The decision was influenced in part by the sheer level of exhaustion experienced by the game's developers, who endured multiple "marathon" crunch sessions to make sure the game was the best it could be, without resorting to another delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very hard to explain your [mental] state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do, and [you're doing it] in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," Grygorovych said of the race to finish the game while dealing with the constant strife of the ongoing war in Ukraine, where GSC was originally headquartered.</p><p dir="ltr">He added that he was surprised to see how much of Stalker 2's media coverage glossed over the fact that it was made in the midst of war, but instead focused more on standard details like patch notes, as if nothing were happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said of the coverage.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2's development was heavily impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. GSC offices were damaged by a fire caused by Russian shelling, and the dev team ultimately had to make the difficult decision to leave their homes in Ukraine to finish work on the sequel to their most iconic title.</p><p dir="ltr">The war's impact can even be seen in the title of the game--while the original Stalker used the Russian spelling of the title (Shadow of Chernobyl), Stalker 2 has changed the spelling to reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of Chornobyl. The devs even created a documentary about the struggle to develop a game set one's home country when that country is being ravaged by war.</p><p dir="ltr">Early in the invasion, Russian forces even occupied Pripyat--the city in which Stalker and Stalker 2 are set--and defaced the nuclear accident site along with the surrounding area. The city of Pripyat is now back under Ukrainian control, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> documentary gives viewers a closer look at the difficulties, complications, and heartbreaks they dealt with during the game's development cycle. Gyrgorovych says half of the development team moved to Prague, while the other half remained in Kyiv. Employee safety was (and remains) a constant concern, and GSC devs yearn for the country they spent so long making games about.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796"></a><figcaption>At one point Russian forces invaded the radioactive city in which the Stalker series is set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very important to remind people what's going on [in Ukraine], because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," Gyrgorovych said. "One layer is we are making the game, and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p><p dir="ltr">Although Grygorovych was a bit surprised by the media's failure to acknowledge the cultural context of the game's creation, his wife Mariia--who also works at the studio--was delighted by the response from players in their home country.

Marii said of the response from Ukrainian players. "It touched everyone in the country."</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [the game's] release," she added.

		<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, Bandai Namco has announced. It will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was first announced in July, with confirmation that BLEACH Rebirth of Souls would contain a brand new story, instead of adapting an established plot instead. A new trailer has been released to mark the March 21st date, and it features Aizen and Yamamoto. These are two more playable characters of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls — Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/duPLssNW04I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em>&nbsp;“The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

		<p>Gran Turismo has been a monolith of racing for PlayStation fans over the past three decades, and so to mark its importance, Sony and Polyphony Digital have put together a new free-to-play experience dubbed My First Gran Turismo.</p>
<p>My First Gran Turismo will be available for free across both PS5 and PS4 via the PlayStation Store on 6th December at midnight local time.</p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xXXU7LlrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aim with this game is to pay homage to the very first entry in the series, appreciating it through the modern game engine of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Still, it’s designed to be “approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level,” series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explains.</p>
<p>The game will include three races, three time trials and three Music Rally stages, as well as a suite of License Tests to complete. 18 cars are included, and the trio of tracks are&nbsp;Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>

<p>In a nice bonus, My First Gran Turismo also has full <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> support via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a nice homage to the franchise history, though this looks like it’s effectively just a demo for Gran Turismo 7. That’s no bad thing, of course, and having even a small slice of GT7 racing available for anyone and everyone to check out on PS4 and PS5 is pretty great in our books.</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has one of those weird and slightly unsettling announcements for gamers to contemplate: they’ve brought the release of their next game… forward? That’s right, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is now releasing one week earlier on 4th February 2025. Surprise!</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day before the debut of a new story trailer at the PC Gamer Show tomorrow, 5th December, as the game is nominated as one of most anticipated games of next year. At the same time the PC</p>


<p>There’s further good news, though. The game has now gone Gold, which used to mean that a game was all done and dusted and ready for release – these days it means that it’s ready to get something put on discs for consoles, while the devs continue to hurriedly squash bugs for a day one patch. Still, it’s a great milestone and allows Warhorse to make some further announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>One of these things is a confirmation of the PC specs and requirements, which will come tomorrow, where they will also reveal the performance that they’re able to get out of consoles. One little tidbit is that the game will have a 60fps mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and it will also be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro Enhanced</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 –&nbsp;Henry and Hans go to the big city</a></h2>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier this year, exploring the opening in the gorgeous countryside of Bohemia (with some not-so-gorgeous narrative twists for Henry and Sir Hans), before leaping ahead to the big city of Kutenberg.</p>

<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.”</p>

This removes them from your party for the remainder of the game, as they are blighted and controlled during the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586">final battle in the city of Minrathous</a></span>. Whoever is kidnapped does defy the elven gods in the end, and as painful as it might be to pick between two of your faves, BioWare says this was all in service of the two’s respective stories, whether that be as an elven historian or a Tevinter reformist. As Epler explained to <em>IGN</em>:</p><figure id="" data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for Neve and Bellara, the two groups that have been the most directly affected by the gods up to this point are obviously the elves – it’s their gods that are back – and Tevinter, Minrathous. You know, the Venatori have either fully seized power or have made some pretty big inroads in Minrathous, depending on which city you save. And the gods have come back and brought their dragons and proclaimed them as the gods of the Tevinter people. So both Bellara and Neve have a direct investment. Not that everyone else doesn’t, but they have the most direct investment in stopping the gods at this point. We wanted to give you that choice between these two characters who, again, have a very personal score to settle with the gods and are both mages whereas Emmrich obviously wants to stop the end of the world, but doesn’t have quite that same connection to the events that are going on. So those two made the most sense as to who would disable them.</p><p>The other thing is something that shows up in the visuals. Minrathous, Tevinter in general has always been kind of...there’s echoes of ancient elven magic in everything to Tevinter and Minrathous does because it’s meant as almost a cargo cult imitation of what the ancient elves were capable of. The ancient elves worked lyrium into their buildings, Tevinter uses gold and jewels because they don’t have the capacity to work lyrium. So it made the most sense for them.”</p><p>But that’s not the only sacrifice you’re forced to make in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final push. The more (potentially) permanent choice is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983">between the dwarven scout Harding or the elven warrior Davrin</a></span>. At the beginning of the final mission, the player must pick one of the two to lead a distraction team as the party begins an assault on the elven god’s base. At the end of this first act, whoever you chose will sacrifice themselves to give the rest of the team an opening and kill one of the gods. According to Epler, Harding was always one of the characters the team planned on putting at risk, while Davrin became the second choice as his story as a Grey Warden formed during development.</p><figure id="" data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“We knew Harding had to be one of them, and then we had to ask ourselves: we’ve got a fan favorite returning character from <em>Inquisition</em>,” Epler said. “Who could possibly equal that in terms of making this difficult choice? It’s like, well, Assan. Assan and Davrin. Davrin obviously has a direct link to this at this point because of Weisshaupt. He’s got a very personal stake in it, and it made sense for the two of them to be the ones to be the choice to lead the distraction team, because again, we want to find those personal connections between the characters and the events that are going on. And, you know, the case of Harding, she has so much investment in this story because she’s been living it since <em>Inquisition</em>. And then Davrin. Davrin’s entire order just fell at the end of the previous act. He’s going to have a real strong investment in stopping the guys too here.”</p><p>The choices are impactful in and of themselves, of course, but as Epler and Busche noted, they can also be complicated further by other things happening in your party when the time comes to make your last stand.</p><p>“One thing that’s so interesting about that choice too, the Harding and Davrin choice is it actually presented some interesting complexity and some emotional investment we could tie into, which always makes for a more satisfying, I will say harder choice to make,” Busche said. “I’ll say in one of my playthroughs, Taash and Harding were in a relationship together and I happened to be romancing Davrin. Impossible. Impossible decision in that moment.”</p><p>While either Bellara or Neve can definitively survive if they’re chosen, the ultimate consequences of the Davrin or Harding choice seem a little ambiguous right now. While neither appears for the rest of the game, fans are latching onto codex entries and dialogue that implies they might still be alive as they look for hope that whoever is lost in the fight may return in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">the next <em>Dragon Age</em></a></span>.

                <p>BioWare is celebrating Dragon Age Day with a handful of surprises for fans centered around the recently released Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but also recognizes what's come before. A standalone version of Veilguard's character creator and a free armor set for the game inspired by Dragon Age II are both now available. Later today, the game will have a new update and you can see the full patch notes for Patch 4 below, which includes a new tool to take photos during the game's cutscenes, 20+ bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions. </p><p>Dragon Age Day was created by the game's fans to give Dragon Age its own version of N7 Day, the day that celebrates the community of BioWare's space epic series, Mass Effect. </p><p>The biggest gift to players is a standalone, free version of the game's character creator. For the folks who haven't taken the plunge into Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you can now create a Rook or Inquisitor, before buying the full game and transferring your character over. You just need to make sure you're on the same platform that you have the creator on.</p><p>There will also be the addition of Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke's armor, body paint, and nose blood smear as free cosmetics for your character. These cosmetics are a permanent addition to the game, and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing The Singing Blade mission.</p><p>Speaking of community, since Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out for over a month, developers will start an AMA over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Age subreddit</a> starting at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET today, December 4..

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025.1051986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-sounds-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the final developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 before the end of 2024. The developer diary is dedicated to sound design in the upcoming first-person action roleplaying game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Unconventional Sound Sources" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FuPAJugr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, by far the most interesting tidbit is that when the developer diaries resume next year, they will include 'customization, weapon systems, release date, and content expansion plans.' The latter is news to us, as there had been no previous hint at any expansion plans for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. It may be a sign that both the developer and publisher are confident in the game's quality and are, therefore, already planning to also create downloadable content to release post-launch.</p>
<p>Should that turn out to be the case, fans might be sighing in relief. Bloodlines 2 has had a troublesome development phase, to say the least. The game was being made by Hardsuit Labs <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the help of Bloodlines designer Brian Mitsoda</a>, but Paradox decided not to go forward with that version of the project. It came awfully close to being canceled, too, but The Chinese Room (Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>) delivered a pitch that convinced Paradox to let them make Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There have been changes, of course. While Seattle remains the setting, the main character has <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-dev-explains-why-they-switched-protagonist-to-an-elder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> from being a newly converted Thinblood to a powerful Elder vampire called Phyre who has been forcefully laid dormant for a hundred years and suddenly awakens in an unfamiliar environment. At launch, players will be able to choose between the following clans: Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue. More will be added after the release, which is tentatively <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>However, Paradox Interactive does not wish to repeat the painful experience of handling a project that is, in their own words, outside of their wheelhouse. As such, any further installments would be licensed out to a third-party studio.</p>

<p>Now, we have My First Gran Turismo, and it is an odd title. I’ll let you in on a secret, there’s a reason Polyphony Digital went with this wording; so let’s lift the suspension and burn some rubber.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-in-depth-hands-on-it-has-the-potential-to-be-a-medieval-masterpiece<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This Henry guy just can't seem to catch a break. When we last left the blacksmith's son-turned-knight at the end of the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance, things were finally starting to look up for him. But the sequel, in true video game sequel fashion, starts by knocking him down a peg or two and dumping him into a new, larger open world to regain his dignity, one side quest at a time. And to be honest, that's refreshing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II picks up almost immediately where the first one left off, but it's certainly not essential to have played it to follow what's going on, thanks to an extended intro that brings you up to speed on the broader strokes. The year is 1403. Henry is a village boy from Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic) who saw his home burned to the ground due to a civil war for the crown taking place between two half-brothers. He ended up in the service of the frustratingly good-looking nepo baby Sir Hans Capon to try and help out the supporters of the royal brother who isn't going around burning down villages, and that plan got… a little sidetracked.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly a start back from square one, though. Henry began the first game as that kind of old-school RPG protagonist who is really just some random guy with no skills to speak of. He could barely hold a sword, and the unforgiving combat really made you feel that until you put in the time to master it. But Henry's a seasoned adventurer now. He knows how to read, which is practically a superpower in medieval Europe. And while you were out partying, he studied the blade.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Taste My Blade</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is reflected in the changes to combat in KCD2, which the developers described as lowering both the skill floor required to play competently and raising the skill ceiling for the most devoted warriors. There are only four attack directions now instead of five. Thrust attacks are no longer a separate attack button, and have instead been folded into the combo system for weapons that make sense with them only. Parries are a bit easier to pull off, and much to my delight, blocking can now defend you from multiple attackers – as long as they're all in front of you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, whether you mastered KCD1's combat or not, the lower skill requirement at the very beginning models the fact that Henry is simply a better fighter by now. But careful stamina management is still the core of every scrap, and button-mashing is one of the quickest ways to die. I came across plenty of challenging encounters even as someone with more than 100 hours across two playthroughs in KCD1, and it's not as easy to spam your way through them by getting a couple of powerful combo moves down to muscle memory.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hill and Dale</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is quite a bit larger as well, with two distinct maps about the size of the first game's that you can travel back and forth between once both are unlocked. The terrain feels fairly familiar, for the most part. We're still in the Central Bohemian woodlands, basically just over the hill from where KCD1 left off. But the level of detail on the terrain and vegetation is a noticeable step up. And better yet, it's way more optimized. My RTX 4070 Super still can't run KCD1 – a six-year-old game – on max settings. But what I played of KCD2 rarely had any performance problems.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The centerpiece of this new world is the city of Kuttenberg, which is quite a bit larger, denser, and more vibrant than anything we saw in KCD1. It's certainly no Paris or Prague, but navigating its crowded streets and markets, taking shortcuts through back gardens, and admiring its grand Gothic architecture is a complete change of pace from wandering around muddy woodland trails. It's big enough to get lost in, built on a realistic scale that makes towns in a lot of other RPGs feel like tiny dioramas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tricks of the Trade</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The side quests I got to play were also very open-ended and complex. The most notable example of this was an arc involving two rival sword schools in Kuttenberg, with the older and more established one (who just happened to support the wrong king) trying to force out the newcomers (who were loyal to our boy, the rightful heir). It fell on my shoulders to steal a ceremonial sword from the established school and display it on the walls of the town hall, which would be seen as an open call for challengers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The quest doesn't much care how you get the sword. I took a sneaky approach, picking a lock to the guild's side entrance. But often you'll be able to choose violence, or even diplomacy to solve your problems. What it does care about is whether or not you get caught carrying out this little false flag operation, as it can affect how the tournament between the two schools plays out. I, of course, maintained plausible deniability and won the competition for my school. But there are a variety of other ways it could have progressed, some of which having long-term consequences. Another quest gave me the option of killing or talking my way past some "bandits," and I was told that if I didn't kill them, they might show up later and present me with new opportunities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Almost everything in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has to offer feels like a careful refinement of its predecessor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Skills and perks have also been expanded upon, and the perks themselves are generally more powerful. Some of the ones in the first game offered a boon and a penalty, which made them feel more like side-grades. Perks in KCD2 are more straightforward upgrades – which they should be, if I'm going to spend my scarce, hard-won progression points on them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Sharp and Shiny</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost everything else Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has to offer feels like a careful refinement of its predecessor. Warhorse isn't reinventing the wagon wheel here. Diplomacy still takes into account factors like what clothing you have on and how clean you are – with a new system of saved favorite outfits so you can quickly switch between combat gear and something more suited to a soiree. But this time, there's more emphasis on picking the right thing to say for the situation, instead of just the option you have the best stats for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alchemy is back, allowing you to craft various potions and concoctions, and it's been made less fiddly. There's a new blacksmithing minigame for forging your own gear and making a bit of coin, following in Henry's father's footsteps. The reading skill has been replaced by Scholarship, which is gained by reading books and can provide boons like opening up new dialogue options. Henry's still crap at reading Latin, though, and I'm not sure if that can be fixed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in addition to new, more diverse move sets for all kinds of melee fighting, Henry can finally get his hands on some guns. This is the early 1400s, so we're talking about extremely primitive firearms. The kind that had the tendency to blow up in your hands. So don't expect to be medieval John Wick. But if you point them the right direction from close enough range, there's really no amount of armor that will save your foes from the blast. Then you probably want to grab a sword, because the remaining foes will not stand there and wait for the subjective eternity it takes you to reload.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">On the Road Again</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In just about every sense, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is shaping up as simply a smoother, prettier, more refined continuation of the things I liked about the original. The core mechanics are mostly the same, but sharper and with deeper progression. The world looks familiar, but broader and more grandiose. I had two whole days to play it and it felt like far too little. When I was first turned loose from the stocks to pick my own path to glory, I felt that tingly feeling you get the first time you play Skyrim or The Witcher 3, of a massive world full of diverse adventures that aren't just clearing icons off of a map. I look forward to spending dozens of hours exploring, gearing up with authentic medieval weapons and armor, and progressing through the improved perk system. Maybe Hans will stop being a huge bag of dicks, too! You know, anything is theoretically possible. I'm just glad I won't have to wait much longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse Studios and developer Deep Silver have made the decision to move up the Kingdom Come: Deliverance II release date from February 11, 2025, to February 4, 2025. If that is the case, it means that they must be confident in how the game is currently shaping up and feel that it's already in a highly polished state. It has been confirmed that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has gone gold already, meaning that the main chunk of development has finished, and they are just working on bug fixes and tiny polishes. For those interested in the game, it's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Apparently there is some more exciting news that is set to be released by Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver in the coming days, including a new story trailer, which will be premiering tomorrow. When the trailer goes live, the console and PC specifications will be released, which will include information about the PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, as well as how the Quality and Performance modes will affect the game on console.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance was an incredibly popular game, so it's no surprise that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a fantastic game with a lot of love poured into it. The team behind it has put a lot of effort into making it historically accurate, and Chris Wray previewed the game just three months ago, where he talks about his thoughts and feelings on playing the game, which you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/"> read here</a>.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the team has been dropping details left and right about the game, including lengthy videos that showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to experience for themselves when the game releases in February. This is a game that has been covered extensively on this site, from<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/"> Q&amp;As</a> to the preview to talking about how the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance has managed to sell eight million copies thus far.</p>
<p>Most recently, Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/">43-minute gameplay video</a>, which was featured in December's IGN First. While the developers had the option to swap over to Unreal Engine, much like many developers in current-day game development, they decided to keep using Crytek's CryEngine, and the game is still shaping up to look stunning and immersive for those history buffs out there.</p>
