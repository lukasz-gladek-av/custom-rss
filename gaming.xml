			<p>Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on March 25, 2025, but the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">delayed</a> with no new release date announced weeks before that initial date. On Friday, Tripwire Interactive finally announced the new release date for <strong>July 24, 2025,</strong> making it a four-month delay.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the new date, Tripwire Interactive's creative director, Bryan Wynia, marked the "<em>incredible</em>" support the studio has seen from fans of the Killing Floor series, since Tripwire delayed Killing Floor 3 specifically to respond to feedback from the series' community.</p>
<p>It was after a closed beta for Killing Floor 3 that didn't go as well as Tripwire would have wanted, which largely influenced the decision to delay the game another four months. Tripwire noted in its March statement confirming the delay that the feedback from that closed beta made the team realize it had "<em>missed the mark</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared</em> <em>vision,</em>" Wynia said in today's press release.</p>
<p>"<em>The support from fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.</em>"</p>
<p>Part of Tripwire's method of responding to community feedback during the delay period has been consistently updating fans on the progress the team made through the game's <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?forums/kf-3-news-announcements.2333661/">official forums</a>. Updates and changes to the UI, design, and artwork have been posted nearly every few days since the delay was announced on March 7, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date-july-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, with the multiplayer-focused zed-slaying shooter now set to release in the summer.</p>

<p>Back in March (which is also when the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally intended to launch</a>), Tripwire <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, citing a need to implement changes suggested by user feedback from the game's closed beta test.</p>

<p>In a new press release, Tripwire says that its development team has been using the extra time from the delay to address that feedback, and so a new release date of July 24th has been set. In the interim, Tripwire says it will release more dev diaries showing off the ways in which it's implementing player suggestions.</p>

<p>The new release date also means that pre-orders for the three different versions of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>&nbsp;- Standard, Deluxe, and Elite - are once again live.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, pre-ordering the Standard version nets you the game, plus a weapon skin set, a weapon trinket, and a player card. The Deluxe edition gets you all of that plus two extra Shadow Agent skin sets, a Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Nightfall Creds.</p>

<p>Finally, the Elite edition includes everything outlined above, but ups the Nightfall Supply Pass total to four and the Creds total to 3000. Pre-orders for all three editions are available across PC and consoles right now.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused first-person shooters. Taking place 70 years after&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 2</em>, it sees you and your buddies teaming up to take down an army of slavering monsters known as Zeds.</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th.</p>

    <p><span>Embark on the final campaign of Flame-Chase Journey.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “The Fall at Dawn’s Rise,” will launch on May 21, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [195 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-964197"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers will join forces with Chrysos Heirs as they enter a pivotal chapter of Flame-Chase Journey. In addition, this version also introduces two new playable characters—Hyacine and Cipher—each bringing their own compelling backstory and distinct flair to the unfolding saga. A wide array of limited-time events will also offer fresh excitement and challenges throughout the journey.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Chrysos Heirs reclaimed the Coreflame of “Death” and “Reason.” Now, in Version 3.3, Trailblazers will stand alongside Chrysos Heirs for the final battle of Flame-Chase Journey—confronting the Sky Titan. According to ancient records, Aquila is a hundred-eyed giant bird. With the sky as its eyelids, it controls the cycles of dawn and dusk. In addition, “Echo of War: Glance of Twilight” will also become available in Version 3.3, offering players brand-new challenges and generous rewards.</p><p>While the people of Amphoreus pursue Era Nova from within their world, the geniuses beyond it are watching closely. At the end of Version 3.2, Madam Herta’s data spirit entity successfully reached the Vortex of Genesis. As the Geniuses delve deeper into their investigation, the root of Amphoreus’s tragedy will gradually come to light and its fate will intertwine with that of the galaxy. Yet, how the story unfolds from here is for players to discover in the chapters ahead.</p><p>In the upcoming story, a new 5-star character, Hyacine, will join the Trailblazer’s team as a vital ally. As the chief physician of the Twilight Courtyard, Hyacine has long been responsible for the medical care of Flame-Chasers. Her ideal is to leave a footnote for ordinary people on the blank pages of epic history, doing her utmost to heal every soul in need. A Wind character following the Path of Remembrance, Hyacine excels at restoring HP for the entire team and boosting overall survivability. By using her abilities and summoning Little Ica, she provides continuous healing to her allies. When she unleashes her Ultimate, Hyacine not only restores HP to all teammates but also increases their Max HP. Additionally, whenever any ally (excluding Little Ica) is attacked or voluntarily sacrifices their own HP, Little Ica will consume its own HP to automatically heal them. Beyond healing, Little Ica can also attack enemies, and the damage Little Ica deals scales with the amount of healing performed.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_964199"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Another new 5-star playable character, Cipher, is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to join the Flame-Chase Journey alongside Aglaea and Tribbie. As the inheritor of Trickery’s divine authority, Cipher has wielded this power for years, yet her movements remain elusive and unpredictable. No one has ever been able to pin down her true whereabouts… A Quantum character following the Path of Nihility, Cipher specializes in targeting the enemy with the highest Max HP on the field, placing them under a special status that records all damage they take. She can also actively switch the marked target, allowing for adaptive tactics mid-battle. When allies attack the marked enemy, Cipher performs a follow-up attack. Upon using her Ultimate, she unleashes additional True DMG based on the total recorded damage!</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters The Herta and Aglaea will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.3 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond the compelling story, Version 3.3 also introduces a variety of exciting events that promise brand-new gameplay experiences. Registration is now open for the Penacony Speed Cup Spheroid Racing Tournament, where top racers will gather for high-stakes showdowns! Trailblazers will take the wheel of their Spheroid Racers and engage in thrilling speed challenges. In addition, thanks to Giovanni’s investment, Legend of the Galactic Baseballer: Demon King is officially launching! Based on player feedback during the previous beta test, the official release retains the raccoon’s quest for the bat while adding a host of exciting new elements that bring fresh challenges to the battlefield.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,099 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

<p>The Strong Museum's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/world-video-game-hall-of-fame/">Video Game Hall of Fame</a> was established back in 2015, with a goal to recognise individual electronic games from arcade to console and everything in between which have "enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general".</p>
<p>And now, having missed out on being inducted to this Hall of Fame back in 2023, N64 classic GoldenEye 007 has finally made the cut.</p>

<p>"GoldenEye surpassed its contemporaries to become the third best-selling game on the Nintendo 64, beaten only by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</a>," the <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/goldeneye-007/">Video Game Hall of Fame team wrote of GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>"Critics lauded it as the premier example of a first-person shooter to succeed on a console rather than a PC, and it is still considered one of the best multiplayer experiences ever produced on a Nintendo system."</p>
<p>This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. When it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online-xbox-game-pass-this-friday">released on Xbox in 2023</a>, I spent quite a bit of time besting my family in the multiplayer. And, thanks to the introduction of Achievements with this Xbox release, I can still look back at my unforgiving gaming dominance with pride... (see below)</p>

            <p>The map masters who make the madcap map mayhem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> have made more maps for maladjusted mates to mop up their misgivings in machinegunning map-bound mockery. The magnificent maraud 'em up has mustered 37 more maps a mere month after the mapsters mapped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">a further 35 maps</a> into the multiplayer mix-up, meaning that by my map math the myriad maps now measure 263 - much more than many mainstream grudge match manufacturers may have mapped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Ahem. </p>
<p>The maps were mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/523090111361976393">major map update</a> that immersed new maps, mechanics and murder machinery into the muzzle misfiring must-play. The makers of the militaristic manshoot have moreover made a stun mine as a means of mystifying your miffed matchmate.   </p>
<p>There's more to mull over. The minicity of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> now manifests as a multiplayer metropolis, a map which may emerge in your memory as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">the murky municipality in the magnificent muckabout</a> of the aforementioned moniker (my most memorable moment was mounting the motorbike).</p>
<p>Another minor modification sees maps maximise movement with a mini marathon, a "Racing System" that may amass more malevolence among mates. To mollify matters militant messers may now muss up their mohawks with markedly more cosmetics. Meanwhile, the main menu has been met with a makeover.</p>
<p>The macabre mirror matches of Straftat are unmissable. In a moment when many media misfits like myself are miscontent with modern multiplayer movement shooters, the immeasurably multiplying maps of the Lemaitres make for a minorly mythical tale of unmatchable might. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">marvellous</a> map for the medium to meet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use", in a bid to prevent emulation and piracy.</p>
<p>All those with a Nintendo account will have received an email (including Eurogamer) linking to the updated policy. And, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> spotted, the wording for the Licence for Digital Products section has been altered.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/eula/GB?lang=en-GB">agreement for UK accounts</a> now states digital products are "licensed only for personal and non-commercial use", and that any "unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable".</p>

<p>This differs slightly from the US, which states: "You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the original wording (effective since April 2021): "You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law."</p>
<p>And here's the UK update in full: "Any Digital Products registered to your Nintendo Account and any updates of such Digital Products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use on a User Device. Digital Products must not be used for any other purpose. In particular, without NOE's written consent, you must neither lease nor rent Digital Products nor sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of Digital Products other than as expressly permitted by applicable law. Such unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable."</p>
<p>The US update is as follows: "Without limitation, you agree that you may not (a) publish, copy, modify, reverse engineer, lease, rent, decompile, disassemble, distribute, offer for sale, or create derivative works of any portion of the Nintendo Account Services; (b) bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use; (c) obtain, install or use any unauthorised copies of Nintendo Account Services; or (d) exploit the Nintendo Account Services in any manner other than to use them in accordance with the applicable documentation and intended use, in each case, without Nintendo's written consent or express authorisation, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/privacy_policy/GB?lang=en-GB">Nintendo Account Privacy Policy</a> has also been updated ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo will be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited period of time - if you give consent.</p>
<p>This is intended for anyone who encounters "language or behaviour that may violate applicable laws", with the company able to review the last three minutes of recorded footage. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment".</p>
<p>The update comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Game Chat feature on Switch 2</a>, where players can essentially video call each other during gameplay.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">Nintendo shared a legal victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which it stated was "significant...for the entire games industry".</p>

			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake may not be in development, but Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, one of the main scenario writers and designers of the classic role-playing game, is "contemplating" developing one.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameReactor</a>, the beloved developer mentioned that it has been a long time since the original was released and that he definitely wants to do something with it. As he has received a lot of requests from fans for a Chrono Trigger remake, he is starting to contemplate it, suggesting that it would be an HD-2D remake and not a full-blown 3D remake in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy.</p>
<p>Besides talking about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger remake, the Dragon Quest series creator also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yuji-horiis-best-tribute-to-the-late-akira-toriyama-we-can-make-a-next-title-using-what-he-had-left-1540733/">future of the series</a> in relation to Akira Toriyama's unfortunate passing. After remarking on how he was shocked at learning that Toriyama-san had passed away, Horii-san revealed that he had left many things before he passed, and he believes that another entry in the series can use what he left to ensure some continuity with the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p data-start="142" data-end="587"><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">Last week</a>, it truly seemed like a Chrono Trigger remake was in development, as Yuji Horii reportedly confirmed it during this year's Napoli COMICON. However, expectations were quickly dashed when it was clarified that the statement was a misunderstanding caused by an interpreter error. Still, given recent statements, there's reason to remain hopeful, even if it may be some time before we can embark once again on one of the most epic journeys through time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-strategy-publishers-baffled-no-xbox-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The current Xbox multiplatform strategy is leaving certain publishers and developers baffled, so much so that they no longer see the need to develop Xbox versions of their games, considering the consolidated PlayStation dominance on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgCII8nnKHg&amp;t=1150s"> recent podcast</a>, The Game Business's co-founder Christopher Dring commented on the current situation of the console market, highlighting how, with Xbox's multiplatform strategy, PlayStation is the dominant player more than ever before in the console space. Almost every Xbox game launching this year is also coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, like DOOM: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>. Only Avowed and South of Midnight did not launch on PlayStation 5 this year, but they could be the final Xbox console exclusives for the time being.</p>
<p>While the Xbox multiplatform strategy could be paying off in some way, as Microsoft's published games on PlayStation 5 are doing quite well, certain publishers and developers are reportedly baffled. From their point of view, they want the competition in the console space, and if Microsoft is releasing their games at launch on other systems, seemingly leaving their hardware behind, they don't see the need to create Xbox versions of games. As such, Christopher Dring highlighted, Microsoft will have to strike a balance in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Has Xbox’s Call of Duty Game Pass gamble paid off?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgCII8nnKHg?start=1150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the current multiplatform strategy seems to suggest otherwise, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles won't be the last gaming systems by Microsoft. The company is hard at work on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include an Xbox-branded handheld in development together with ASUS, of which we saw the first images <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/">earlier this week,</a> a full-fledged handheld system and a proper home console that will be the successor to the Xbox Series X and that will deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical&nbsp;leap to date</a>. With the current market conditions being so challenging, however, plans could definitely change, and it will be very interesting to see how the big console manufacturers will manage to overcome all these hurdles that are making gaming a very expensive hobby.</p>

            <p>I've been meaning to research the Crusades for a while. A series of vicious medieval religious wars for control of the Holy Land, initiated by the Latin Christian Church following the conquest of Jerusalem by the Rashidun Caliphate, they've become a collection of memes bandied around by today's armchair fascists. See also, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">"deus vult"</a>. I've explored them indirectly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">articles about the cultural inheritance of Warhammer 40,000</a>, but never really dipped into any history books or crusader fiction save for ailing 2004 action game Knights Of The Temple: Infernal Crusade, in which Sir Spamalot Go Bonk against a majestic sunset.</p>
<p>One place to start the R&amp;D rollout might be Knights Of The Crusades, a grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> 4X game in which players re-enact the period from the perspective of Christian and Muslim factions.</p><!--more-->

<p>Knights Of The Crusades launched into early access this week, and "takes you on a grand journey through the First Crusade and beyond--across the Holy Land, Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Europe." It's from the developers of the Kingdom Wars games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-the-machine-starts">which we have enjoyed in the past</a>, and strikes me as basically Age Of Empires but Paradox-scale.</p>
<p>The main campaign sees you first tooling up to contest Jerusalem and then, growing your holdings as you "shape a world that reacts to your choices across a massive dynamic map filled with cities, pilgrim routes, shifting alliances, and relentless holy wars". There is much talk in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440120/_Knights_of_the_Crusades/">the Steam page overview video</a> of raiding hamlets and putting innocents to the sword. Glamorising it may be, but it doesn't seem sanitised. There's the endgame prospect of, essentially, becoming the bad guys from Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>The above describes the initial Eastern European Christian or Templar campaigns, anyway: as regards the early access update schedule, the developers are promising "a lot of focus on making every culture feel unique, with new units, building sets, and mechanics for Pagan, Orthodox, Muslim, and Western Christian factions."</p>
<p>Will it turn out to be a careful study of two hundred years of zealotry and pillage, or will it be another excuse for the scurvy alt-righteous to cosplay as Richard the Lionheart, or will it be some secret third thing? Only you, a hypothetical Crusades historian and/or time-traveller who has played the 1.0 version, can decide. Right now, I'll settle for saying that I'm abstractly interested in the idea of a campaign that begins with a Zerg rush towards a specific location, then phases into a more open-ended and murky 4X structure.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start any video game-skewed Crusades research would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, but I fear I am too daft and fickle to play Crusader Kings. Or too time-strapped, anyway. Still, I welcome any advice you have about either the Paradox series or other video games that investigate this terrible period and its legacy. It can't be <em>all</em> strategy sims, surely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some Steam Deck and PC-specific fixes alongside other improvements and balance changes.</p>
<p>The 1.2.3 patch introduces a minor Steam Deck improvement, fixing backgrounds of various menus not displaying correctly on the system, as well as various ultrawide resolutions fixes, including gameplay no longer becoming zoomed after a cutscene, combat UI not properly adapting to ultrawide resolutions, cutscenes no longer getting letterboxed in 32:9 ratio, and more. Mouse and Keyboard controls also received some improvements, such as UI button prompts in the Expedition Menu now being fully visible and triggered with Keyboard, mouse button remaining responsive after first use, and more.</p>
<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also packs some fixes for areas where characters would get stuck on the world map, situations where Esquie would get stuck, and some balance changes. The skill that saw the most significant change is Maelle's Stendhal, which was extremely powerful in the previous version of the game, and could be easily used to one-shot even the most powerful bosses with the proper setup. You can learn more about every change the patch brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499446847117461384?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

			<p>Despite the imminent launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Japanese company will continue to support the older console with new games. The confirmation arrived with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's latest quarterly financial report</a>, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>These are first-party titles for Nintendo Switch that have already been announced: Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025), Pokémon Champions (TBD). In the Nintendo Direct held this March, we announced plans to release the titles Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream in 2026.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, we will continue to bring out new titles for the over 100 million people worldwide who are playing Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>The console's hardware sales have unsurprisingly declined year-over-year. Whereas in fiscal year 2024 Nintendo sold in (to retailers) 15.70 million units, fiscal year 2025 hardware sales stopped at 10.80 million units, a 31.2% drop. Cumulative sell-through (to consumers) lifetime sales are approaching 150 million units.</p>
<p>With such a huge install base, second only in the all-time console hardware charts to Sony's PlayStation 2 (the best-selling console of all time with over 160 million units sold), it's no wonder that Nintendo wants to keep making games for the Switch. At the same time, Nintendo also understands the importance of making exclusive titles to push consumers to buy the new Switch 2 when it lands on June 5. For instance, Mario Kart World <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will only be available on the new console</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be making the switch (pun entirely intended) right away, or will you keep playing with the previous console for some time? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>Bam Margera will officially return in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, but as a secret skater.</p>
<p>Margera first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and returned in each subsequent game in the series. However, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">remake was announced back in March</a>, fans noticed the skater missing from the playable line-up.</p>
<p>Now, Activision has confirmed in a social media post he'll be making his return, along with a video of Margera joking about missing flights in the past due to getting sucked into the second game.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Margera was initially left out of the line-up, with fans speculating it may be related to legal issues he's faced following struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>However, skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">Margera would still appear thanks to the insistence of Tony Hawk himself</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."</p>
<p>The last minute addition would perhaps explain why he's a secret unlockable skater, rather than being available from the start.</p>

<p>The confirmed skater roster features both classic skaters and newer additions, including Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.</p>
<p>The remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will arrive on 11th July across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft Store). It will be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC too.</p>
<p>Fans also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">spotted some changes to the career mode in the fourth game</a> - objectives will now need to be completed under a timer instead of exploring levels freely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game, but developer Toby Fox has announced the RPG will be cross-compatible with both Switch consoles.</p>
<p>That means if you buy the Switch 1 version now, you can get the Switch 2 version later at no additional cost. Similarly, on the PlayStation Store, you get both the PS4 and PS5 versions at once.</p>
<p>Fox also <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/">confirmed the release times for the game</a>, with the Switch 2 version being available from 5th June at midnight local time in each respective region. That does mean Japanese players will have access to the game much earlier than those in the US.</p>

<p>For other platforms, though, the game will launch at a specific time globally - that's midnight Japan time on 5th June, meaning it's actually out on 4th June in other countries.</p>
<p>As such, the launch times for the game will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am local time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am JST</li>
<li>4th June 4pm UK</li>
<li>4th June 5pm CET</li>
<li>4th June 11am EDT</li>
<li>4th June 8am PDT</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Fox shared a handful of trophies that will be available on the PlayStation version of the game. He noted players will need to complete the current "room" where a trophy unlocks in order to receive it.</p>
<p>He added: "But, really, I think you'll enjoy the game more if you don't pay attention to whether you get the trophies."</p>
<p>Deltarune is Fox's follow-up to the cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>. Though development began in 2012, it's been released episodically as a series of chapters - the first two were available for free when released in 2018 and 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>This release next month will therefore at long last mark the game's complete release.</p>
<p>"Toby Fox is in a weird position," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the first two Deltarune chapters</a>. "On one level, he has every artist's dream: near unlimited resources, plenty of time, and an eager fanbase willing to lick the dregs of an idea from his outstretched fingertip. He can make whatever he likes. But whatever he makes, be it a cupcake or a clothing brand or a package holiday business, will be compared, inevitably, to Undertale."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> will get a non-VR release on PC later this year, allowing would-be Colonial Marines access to its Weyland-Yutani black site without first requiring you to force your head inside a pair of microscopic televisions. Subtitled "Evolved Edition" - which feels like a real elbow in the kidneys for VR evangelists - it will sport "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals".

<p>As you may guess from the above, I'm not a VR evangelist, partly because I can't afford a modern VR headset and don't have the living space to play VR games without injuring myself, my loved ones or my precious (scavenged) bedroom furniture. I only own an original PSVR, which is curled up in the corner of my cupboard like a dead servo-skull. It was last used to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-squadrons">Star Wars: Squadrons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-beast">Paper Beast</a>, which are the two VR games I consider worth the discomfort, if not the expense, of VR.</p>
<p>I hear that the latest Zucker Buckets and Gaben Goggles are more comfortable to wear, but I still don't trust myself to put them on without becoming a public health hazard. I have terrible, humiliating memories of previewing some Marvel VR game at an event. Surrounded by the minions of Thanos, I swung Thor's hammer with all of my strength and clanged the PR person over the head. This happened in a converted warehouse about 300 metres wide. Now, imagine if I'd been surrounded by digital xenomorphs. That PR person would be dead.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm delighted that Rogue Incursion has decided to trade in its fancy eyestrain helmet for reassuringly non-engulfing 2D displays. Here's some story blurb about Rogue Incursion. It's the first of a two-act story, with the second act promising "new challenges and deadlier enemies".</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new action-horror entry into the classic franchise, Alien: Rogue Incursion transforms you into Zula Hendricks-the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments-on an extremely dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan. With her synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled stealth and serious firepower at her disposal. And when the threat she discovers has extinction-level consequences, Zula suddenly finds herself with humanity's fate on her shoulders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Evolved Edition launches on 30th September. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a>. Did you play the VR one? Let us know how you got on with it. While we're talking Alien, I'll conclude by shoving you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">the next game from the people behind Duskers</a>, one of the finest unofficial Alien games yet made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game runs on Epic's Unreal Engine 5, having moved off the proprietary engine previously used in Mafia III and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>. Because of that, some concerns regarding the often-present stuttering are inevitable. However, the game is not an open world, unlike previous entries in the franchise. Hangar 13 has instead chosen to go with a linear, narrative-driven experience, as explained by studio president Nick Baynes:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay. That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.</em></p>
<p>Without the need to stream in a large, explorable world, stuttering issues could be less problematic than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Of course, we won't know for sure until the game launches on August 8.</p>
<p>What we do know is that Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be available to stream via NVIDIA GeForce NOW on day one</a> for all those players whose PCs do not meet the above system requirements.</p>

            <p>That's a wrap on Fallout season two. And what better way to celebrate the end of a hard shoot than peeling off your skin? OK, I can think of many better ways, but that is how actor Walton Goggins decided to share the news.</p>
<p>Goggins plays Fallout's gunslinging Ghoul in the Amazon show, and as his character has been exposed to plenty of radiation and harsh conditions, the actor wears a lot of prosthetics to get the look just right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZqMmDOBab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post on Instagram</a>, Goggins peeled off his Ghoulish outer layer and threw it at the camera. In true Goggins fashion, though, he made it look good.</p>
<p>Fellow Fallout star Ella Purnell, meanwhile, shared a more wholesome photo to mark the end of production. "aaaaand that’s a wrap on @falloutonprime Season 2 folks! 🤓," Purnell, who plays Vault dweller Lucy in show, wrote with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZnLWFKUHw/?igsh=MTV6OHNxbWN6ZnZ5Zg%3D%3D">an accompanying photo</a> of the actress next to her on-screen dad Kyle MacLachlan.</p>

<p>The Fallout X account also shared the news, writing "Achievement unlocked! Fallout Season 2 has wrapped production." The account shared Goggins' skin shedding shots, so feel free to enjoy those below.</p>

<p>Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't "wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>As for what we can expect with the second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Goggins has assured fans it will blow the first season out of the water</a>.

            <p>Rumours of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> remake briefly bubbled up before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-sorry-put-the-party-poppers-away-chrono-trigger-isnt-getting-a-remake-as-far-as-anyone-knows-anyway">swiftly pin-popped last week</a>, following a mistranslation of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s writer, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> creator Yuji Horii at a panel. The potion-swilling public were understandably chuffed (you still can't Google Horii's name without being served videos of pog-faced excite-os screaming "Chrono Trigger Remake Confirmed!!!"), but it soon turned out that no such remake was actually planned.</p>
<p>Based on a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/">Gamereactor</a> at the same event, it sounds like Horii has been considering doing something with Chrono Trigger after all, which isn't too surprising after Square Enix said they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">planned to celebrate</a> the game's 30th anniversary with "various projects" back in March. From Gamereactor:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>"Yes, it is. It has been a long time. Yes, I want to do something", Horii-san tells Gamereactor when asked about the celebrations for the Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary. "Currently, Dragon Quest has seen III, I-II [HD-2D] Remakes. I get a lot of requests for the remake of Chrono Trigger as well, and so I am starting to contemplate on it",</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is nice, although not all that exciting to me personally for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Chrono Trigger is still extremely playable, and secondly, I've never actually understood what all the fuss was about. I guess I view Chrono Trigger like I view The Beatles: sure, I can accept they pushed the medium forward, but I don't actually care to listen to them for fun except about a third of Sergeant Pepper's. Also, I'm still salty that Frog turned out to be a human named pissing Glenn. Glenn! Just let your talking frog knight be a talking frog knight, game.</p>
<p>That said, the fairground trial scene blew my mind when I first played it, so I can only imagine how wild it was in 1995 to have a JRPG call you a stinking thief for eating a man's lunch after you'd been conditioned to treat layabout items as a purely ludic contrivance. Still, give me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Arms_(video_game)">Wild Arms</a> remake over this any day. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/airships-dinosaurs-and-robots-meet-in-spiritual-successor-to-chrono-trigger-rpg-threads-of-time">Threads Of Time looks nice though</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
