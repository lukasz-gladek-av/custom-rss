            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has been played by over two million people, Ubisoft has announced, while hinting at more from the franchise to come.</p>
<p>The Lost Crown, released in January 2024, was the first new game in the series since 2010's middling The Forgotten Sands, arriving alongside The Rogue Prince of Persia from Evil Empire that remains in early access.</p>
<p>"You've revived the legend," reads a post on social media. "The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up."</p>

<p>The Lost Crown sold 1.3m copies in its first year, with overall players now reaching over two million thanks to its inclusion on Ubisoft's subscription and PS Plus, as well as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-comes-to-mobile-next-month">recent mobile release</a>.</p>
<p>However, French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami</a> reported last October the team behind the game had been disbanded and it would not receive a sequel, owing to its commercial performance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">follow-up statement to Eurogamer</a>, the game's senior producer Abdelhak Elguess confirmed "most" of the team had "shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise".</p>
<p>He added: "We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."</p>

<p>As The Lost Crown has reached the end of its post-launch roadmap, it's unclear precisely how the prince is "just warming up", as per that social media post.</p>
<p>Presumably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">more updates are on the way to The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> ahead of a supposed full release out of early access.</p>
<p>There's also the forthcoming, and much-delayed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">Sands of Time remake that's now targeting a 2026 release</a>.</p>
<p>But will there be more sidescrolling Metroidvania action from The Lost Crown team?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Apple case that required Apple to enable developers to offer their customers alternative ways to make purchases outside apps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Sweeney put forward a “peace proposal” to Apple, which Epic has battled against in the courts for years now. “If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,” Sweeney said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come">IGN reported on how Sweeney had spent billions of dollars fighting Apple and Google over the way the companies run their app stores</a>. Sweeney told IGN at the time that he considered it a long-term investment in Epic and Fortnite’s future, insisting Epic could afford to keep up the fight for decades to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in the U.S., nearly five years later Fortnite is finally set to return.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/tim-sweeney-1746092302375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes.

Unlawful here, unlawful there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple will now be referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. "Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case. Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was "replete with misdirection and outright lies," the judge wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple in a statement said "we strongly disagree with the decision.

            <p>
A major European retailer has raised the price of Xbox Series X and both variants of the Xbox Series S overnight, prompting speculation of a wider price hike.
</p>
<p>
Xbox fans spotted the increases at French retail giant Micromania this morning (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/">ResetEra</a>), and noted that each model was now €50 more expensive. 
</p>
<p>
The suggestion here is that Micromania has pushed an imminent price rise live early, before Xbox announces the changes itself. Eurogamer understands that wider price rises are on the table, and has contacted Microsoft for comment.

</figure>
<p>
In Europe, or at least at Micromania, the Xbox Series X has increased in price from €549.99 to €599.99. The original 512GB Xbox Series S has meanwhile increased from €299.99 to €349.99, while the newer 1TB Xbox Series S has gone up from €349.99 to €399.99.
</p>
<p>
Today's development comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of PlayStation 5 here in the UK</a>, as well as in mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
Sony blamed that change on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates". The company last raised the cost of PS5 in Europe back in August 2022.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">struggled with its Switch 2 pricing in the US</a>, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the cost of the console's accessories</a> ahead of its launch in response to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">ever-changing tariff situation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">Microsoft reported a further fall in sales of its Xbox hardware</a> as part of its latest quarterly financial results. But overall revenue from Microsoft's gaming division was up, thanks to money made primarily by Call of Duty, Minecraft and Game Pass subscriptions.

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA have announced they're "pausing" development of any future rally racers, including the filth-speckled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wrc">WRC</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dirt-5">Dirt</a> series. Many rally games have historically been made by the now EA-owned studio Codemasters, a crowd of long-time motorsports specialists who've been soiling wheel arches as far back as Colin McCrae Rally for the first PlayStation. Well, no more, say the big wigs. The games have "reached the end of the road", they say. Bad news for fans of muck and sand on wheels, but there is a splash of muddy hope just past the next hard right.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players," said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">a statement</a> from Codemasters. "Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and Dirt. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge."</p>
<p>All those games have now tumbled off that ragged edge, just like 10-year-old me playing Colin McCrae Rally on a PS1 demo disc in 1998. Codemasters have been responsible for much of the genre over the past few decades with the Dirt series, as EA mention above. But the parallel WRC series has also flown the flag, going through the hands of many different developers and publishers. French studio Kylotonn made the games for a while, publishing under Bigben Interactive. Codies got the license to make WRC games in 2020, and then everything became one big corporately consolidated parking lot when Codemasters themselves were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/electronic-arts-have-bought-codemasters">snorted up by EA</a> the following year. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Codemasters / Electronic Arts</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, we can add the deletion of blockbuster rally games from the near future to the many negative effects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">corporations binge eating other smaller businesses</a>. It's not yet clear how this decision has impacted workers at Codemasters, but it is obviously concerning given EA's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">wave of layoffs</a>. EA has cut between 300 and 400 jobs across their company this week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">reports by Bloomberg</a>.

</p><p>There is one faint god ray shining into these roadside puddles. Rally is (and always has been) open to smaller developers. In particular, the low-poly indie racer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a> has been favourably received by dirtsters. And <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> offers similar Sega Saturnesque drifts around high-rise parking facilities. There's also the lesser-known <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/">Old School Rally</a>, and the illegal rally racing in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>. Uh, provided you know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">how to build an entire car</a> from scratch. We have a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a> too, if you fancy that. </p>
<p>Remember: when big corpos buy out all the bacon, go looking for the tasty lardons. Also, this doesn't necessarily mean the end for WRC games. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, the international vroomsports body that runs the real life World Rally Championship) has teased <a href="https://x.com/OfficialWRC/status/1917610425153097758">on Xitter</a> that the game series will continue in the hands of another developer somewhere, as pointed out by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/ea-says-codemasters-wont-be-making-any-more-rally-games-weve-reached-the-end-of-the-road-working-on-wrc/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Now our WRC gaming franchise is going in an ambitious new direction," they say, "with more news coming in the near future."</p>

<p>The change comes as part of a major firmware update released yesterday for the older console, in preparation for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next month.</p>
<p>Previously, the eShop listed best-selling games by total downloads from the past 14 days. That's now been changed to list games by total revenue from the past three days (spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc">GVG</a>, via <a href="https://kotaku.com/slop-nintendo-switch-eshop-best-seller-firmware-update-1851778523">Kotaku</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>On the one hand, this appears to be a good move to help filter out cheap shovelware games. The eShop has been rife with cheap imitation games and "slop" - back in December, copycat games based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">Unpacking</a> were both called out.</p>
<p>The change in ranking means cheap games looking to make rapid sales will no longer be prioritised at the top of the charts, meaning studios will be disincentivised to game the charts with cheap knock-offs and sale prices aimed at undercutting bigger releases.</p>
<p>The flip side, though, is that legitimate indie games will likely have a more difficult time being discovered on the store. Instead, the chart will likely be dominated by fully priced AAA games - most notably, Nintendo's own, considering they're very rarely discounted.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the eShop Charts are dominated by predictable releases: Minecraft is top, followed by Animal Crossing, FC25, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least an option to view download exclusive games in the same format, though it's not shown by default.</p>
<p>It's certainly a welcome change, then, that focuses on legitimate games, but it's not necessarily an ideal solution.</p>
<p>Presumably this change will carry over to Switch 2, when it's released on 5th June. Nintendo previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-was-almost-called-the-super-nintendo-switch">digital store will have improved performance on the new console</a>, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2">still won't have any music</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">Switch firmware update arrived yesterday</a>, adding Gameshare, Virtual Game Cards and more.</p>
<p>However, it was soon spotted that sharing Virtual Game Cards means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">games can no longer be played online simultaneously across two consoles</a>, which users have called a "downgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sometimes a video game is an epic. It’s daunting, and it’s forever, and it’s a slate of marble you slowly chip away at for weeks and months and an entire year. Other times, a video game is lightning and fireworks. It’s an instant flash, and immediate dopamine, and a bag of chips that’s empty before you know it but also maybe empty before you have too much of it. It’s Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shotgun Cop Man |  Weapons Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F6Vk0TcbmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;puts arcade action and mechanical perfection above all else. As the follow-up to indie sleeper hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">My Friend Pedro</a>,&nbsp;it’s stripped down and simplified in a lot of ways to achieve that. There’s a story here in the loosest and most barely defined sense of the word: you are shotgun cop man, and you need to go to hell to arrest Satan. It’s and instant, charmingly stupid setup to get you straight to the business in a way that’s reminiscent of the most experimental Adult Swim cartoons. Don’t worry about why you’re here, just accept that you are here and have fun.</p>


<p>Your journey through Hell takes the form of a sidescrolling twitch-precision platformer, but you don’t have a jump button. Instead you have a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. The kick of the shotgun gives a rocket-jump level of bounce when fired, and the pistol keeps you afloat and just barely manoeuvrable while in mid-air. Both weapons have limited clip sizes, but they reload the instant you touch the ground. Every level has an exit and a slew of demons, traps, and platforms in the way of it, tasking you with learning the ropes of your momentum-based toolkit to safely navigate there.</p>


<p>Shotgun Cop Man does a great job of consistently dishing out new elements through each level and chapter of the campaign to keep the challenge fresh and justify the 100+ levels you’ll be shotgun-hopping through. New weapons give you alternative ways to dispose of enemies and unique momentum-modifiers, while the increasing array of traps and obstacles keep you guessing. I love that the game is incredibly challenging, but also refreshingly forgiving in how it lets you tackle those challenges – upon death, you can instantly load back into a checkpoint in the middle of the level, and the game is incredibly generous with the placement of these checkpoints, often dumping you right back where you died each time.</p>
<p>You can die and hop back in as many times as you need to in order to finish a level, but each level comes with a trio of completion challenges tasking you with defeating every enemy, beating it without dying, and beating it in a certain time limit. You don’t have to complete all of these challenges for each stage, but they offer a nice incentive to slowly wean yourself off the checkpoint system as you become more confident in your shotgun-copping skills.</p>

<p>That variety in level design and mechanics I mentioned earlier, sadly, isn’t reflected nearly as well in the other areas of the game. Every level of Shotgun Cop Man looks practically identical to the last, sporting black level geometry on a gloomy darkened background that means they all blend together. The lack of environmental variety, or even some basic colour palette swaps makes every chapter blend together. Even in the game’s custom campaign editor, which lets you freely draw out and share your own custom levels or chapters online, you have no options for visual customisation or even song selection. I love a game with Workshop mod support and custom content options, but when these options only provide mechanical alterations and no aesthetic or visual ones, I can’t imagine there being much room for creativity in the kind of custom campaigns we’ll see from this game.</p>
<p>It’s still an absolute treat to blast through hundreds of demons in Shotgun Cop Man and master the finicky art of shotgun-jumping, I just wish there was a bit more care put into offering some visual and auditory variety to make each moment of the game stand out a bit more from the last. It’s an impressive and incredibly addictive experience nonetheless, but ends up being a blast of fireworks that’s over just a bit sooner than you were hoping for.</p>

        <p>App Store must now allow alternative payment options.</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is celebrating an enormous US court decision that forces Apple to allow alternative payment options on iPhone.
</p>
<p>
This is the key issue that began the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple last night by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker "in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing". 
</p>
<p>
That particular injuction saw Apple being told it had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which Apple agreed but then decided to levy a 27 percent fee when doing so - effectively restoring its regular app store cut. 
</p>
<p>
In fiery terms, the US court has now said this move "strains credulity" and branded it an "obvious cover-up" designed to allow Apple to continue with "anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream".
</p>
<p>
The damning verdict echoes many of the arguments previously made by Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, who has campaigned against Apple's fresh barriers to outside payments.
</p>
<p>
"Apple's response," the court verdict reads, was to "impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page 'scare' screens, static URLs, and generic statements. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple's goal," the verdict continues, "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."
</p>
<p>
More dramatic still, the court states that Apple documentation reveals the company "knew what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option", and that "to hide the truth, vice-president of finance Alex Roman outright lied under oath".
</p>
<p>
Sweeney, who previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499">took to social media last night to celebrate the decision</a> - and state that Fortnite would return to the US iPhone App Store next week.
</p>
<p>
"NO FEES on web transactions," Sweeney wrote. "Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.
</p>
<p>
"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week. 
</p>
<p>
"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Apple for comment, and asked whether it will be considering Sweeney's offer.
</p>
<p>"We strongly disagree with the decision," an Apple spokesperson stated in response. "We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Throes of the Watchmaker, the much-anticipated DLC for retro RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, will release later this month on 20th May.</p>
<p>The carnival-themed post-game adventure will arrive for free across all platforms: Nintendo Switch, Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The news was shared alongside a fresh trailer, showing off clockwork enemies, a new party member for the turn-based battles, and of course plenty of beautiful pixel art.</p>

<p>Throes of the Watchmaker will take place as a side adventure to the main plot, with Solstice Warriors Valere and Zale exploring the cursed carnival of Horloge to defeat the "mischievous Puppeteer".</p>
<p>The DLC promises over eight hours of gameplay, new playable classes for its pair of protagonists, the aforementioned new party member (called Arty), and three player local co-op.</p>
<p>It's also said to link to the studio's previous game, ninja platformer The Messenger.</p>
<p>Sea of Stars first released back in August 2023 - it's a retro RPG heavily inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Super Mario RPG, with its active turn-based combat and chiptune score. I previously spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">composer Eric W. Brown about working with Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>Though no longer available on PS Plus, the game is still on Xbox Game Pass if you're looking to catch up.</p>
<p>What's more, if the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">turn-based action of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has caught your attention, Sea of Stars is well worth a look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The pioneering rally simulation kicked off a series of successful and highly esteemed racing games. Following the death of Colin McRae in 2007, the series retired McRae’s name and continued its evolution as Dirt. 2009’s Dirt 2 (known as Colin McRae: Dirt 2 in Europe and other PAL game territories) marked a transitional point for the series, which was reinvented again as a hardcore simulation in 2015’s Dirt Rally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2023’s EA Sports WRC was the first Codemasters rally game to hold an official WRC license since 2002’s Colin McRae Rally 3. IGN’s review notes EA Sports WRC took the class-leading feel of 2019’s Dirt Rally 2.0 and stuffed it into an officially licensed World Rally Championship experience, like a steel rod in Timo Rautiainen’s backside, but its technical gremlins left it feeling like a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-wrc-review">“great racing game trying to fight its way out of an unfinished one.”</a> Subsequent updates sought to improve its screen tearing issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

It was also difficult to get to the mines from the nearest village due to its rugged surroundings coupled with heavy snowfall.

This announcement came well after our review of what we were initially told would be the full game was largely complete – however, the update post indicates that the content at its new launch will be the same as what we played, so we have decided to publish this as a review of the Early Access version.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have to admit, I’m a sucker for direct-to-video sequels. There’s something about being five Tremors movies deep where all pretense is abandoned, and we all know what we are there for: To watch some ridiculous action and give our brains a break for a bit. La Quimera reminds me a lot of popcorn flicks like that. This FPS is not particularly good-looking, well-written, or innovative. The action doesn’t do anything memorable, and its acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. There is admittedly a certain charm to be found here, especially if you bring a friend or two along to share this rocky ride in co-op. But by nearly every metric, La Quimera is about as good a game as Tremors 5: Bloodlines is a movie. Which is to say it’s not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the fictional South American city of Nuevo Caracas, the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Outside the city walls, some sort of robot apocalypse that’s never really explained is taking place. Inside, there are warring corporations and extreme poverty. That setup isn’t a socio-political commentary so much as a throwback to 80s sci-fi, complete with Power Loader-esque rigs that would look right at home on Ellen Ripley in Aliens. As a new PMC recruit, you and your squad get stuck in the middle of some nonspecific and uninteresting power struggle between corporations, leaving an equal mix of broken bodies and bots in your wake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">La Quimera Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some legitimately cool environmental storytelling here. My favorite by far is the Bone Wall, a literal wall filled with what must be thousands of skeletons, that you get to see when one mission takes you deep through it. A voice in your ear describes the desperation that went into building the wall as all hell was breaking loose, and it’s neat to piece together how there was no time to slow down and help anyone who fell, whether that was due to exhaustion, injury, or dying from whatever encroaching threat drove the frantic construction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, La Quimera would have been better off if it let the environments do <em>all </em>the talking, because once its characters open their mouths, it is rough. The dialogue is awful, with obscenity-laced tirades that sound like someone watched a Quentin Tarantino movie once, and tried to mimic it without knowing how to make any of the lines land. The acting also ranges from a normal kind of bad to so awkward I can’t tell if it’s being purposefully campy or potentially using some sort of poorly implemented AI. Characters are very chatty too, and I found myself actively cringing on several occasions as allies shout out things like, “Oh perfect, robot dogs!”. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dialogue is awful, and I found myself actively cringing on several occasions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story itself doesn’t make much sense, either. Apparently, saving a billionaire’s daughter gets your PMC conscripted because… you are afraid he will sue? Which, naturally, means the people in the PMC all have to get experimental and highly dangerous augmentations, too. I wouldn’t mind the nonsense, it’s fine enough as a vehicle to make me want to go shoot robots – but the story is so clearly unfinished, ending abruptly after just a few hours without resolving anything. Developer Reburn unexpectedly decided to delay La Quimera on the day it was supposed to launch, and then later announced its eventual release would have the Early Access label on it. Given development is largely based out of Kyiv in Ukraine, the fact that it’s still coming out at all feels like something of an achievement worth applauding. But while this campaign is planned to grow over time, the version that's here now doesn't have any semblance of a complete story. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Identity Crysis</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">La Quimera isn’t exactly shy about the influence Crysis has had on it. Early on, you and your crew gain access to exosuits, complete with energy-powered armor, cloaking, and scanning. That last bit is especially important – one quick ping allows you and your teammates to see any nearby enemies, even behind cover. That’s huge when your weapons operate like a poor man’s version of the FarSight from Perfect Dark, able to lethally penetrate shockingly thick obstacles. It’s extremely satisfying to drop a bunch of orange silhouettes in rapid succession from sight unseen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, where Crysis tended to be more of an inverted funnel that pushed you toward open areas, La Quimera is decidedly about straight lines. Its levels are very linear, and your objective is almost always to clear enemies as you walk from point A to point B. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as a bit of a throwback like this can be a welcome palate cleanser in a time when wide-open gameplay is increasingly the norm, but it does all start to become a bland blur. That’s because so many areas repeat the same cycle of kill the enemies, open the heavy door, kill the next enemies, open the next heavy door, and so on. There are a handful of encounters that break that trend, most notably an extended gunfight on a slowly rising elevator in a corporate office building, but they are few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gunplay itself is extremely basic, with your weapons effectively limited to a sidearm, shotgun, or rifle. You can’t change guns mid-mission, nor pick up any temporary options like a limited-use power weapon. You are given the choice between conventional firearms and electromagnetic weapons – the former works better against humans, while the latter tears through shields and robots more quickly – but you’ll be required to bring one of each into your missions anyway. Which one gets to be the more powerful primary weapon and which is relegated to your sidearm could have added a small strategic wrinkle, but the conventional arms are <em>so</em> poor against bots that there’s only one right choice, which is too bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing I like best about the fights themselves is the ammo economy. Bullets can become scarce, especially in later missions, which means you can’t just sit in one spot and pick off every enemy by shooting through walls the whole time. I had to keep moving to either scavenge rounds off of corpses or find more ammo boxes, which was just enough to create some badly needed forward momentum during otherwise slow fights. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Time is Money</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a PMC, you are, of course, paid for completing missions – but while there are things to buy between them, the progression is badly underbaked at this point. There aren’t enough items or upgrades for sale in the first place, and the stuff that <em>is </em>here isn’t very interesting. You could buy one of a very small number of generic guns, or invest in either of the two alternate versions of your exosuit’s head, arms, torso, and legs, each of which have differences like improved cooldowns or increased med kit capacity. But those effects are all so small that it’s hard to feel a need for any of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way you get money is a little weird, too. In addition to completing missions, cash can also be found in containers mid-level – but you have very shallow pockets for some odd reason, hitting “max money” far too quickly (which is a problem I can say with all honesty I have never experienced in my life). That's too bad, because collecting more would have given me a real incentive to go off the beaten path. There are some of the obligatory voice memos people seem to leave behind in every video game, but I can’t bring myself to opt into hearing more of this dialogue than I absolutely need to. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite military shooters</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For as down as I am on La Quimera (and, believe me, I am), I did still have a strangely fun time with it. That’s due primarily to two things: First, you can play the entire campaign (minus the tutorial) in online co-op with up to two other people. A couple of buddies is the exact thing you need to transform cringey dialogue from something you’ll roll your eyes at into a hilarious shared experience. Having another gun or two covering your back makes the combat more exciting as well, and the ability to do things like alternate who is doing scans so that you are never waiting on that ability’s cooldown keeps the fights moving at a faster pace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other quality that keeps its many issues from becoming downright infuriating is how short La Quimera is. It took me right around four hours to complete my first playthrough. That could certainly be a negative if you put a lot of weight on “hours played per dollar spent” or whatever, but it does make a stronger case for going in with some friends, having a ridiculous time, and then getting out in a way that lets you enjoy the handful of high points while minimizing the impact of the lows. Of course, one of the reasons for this brief length is that La Quimera is outright incomplete in parts, and it would need to be significantly fleshed out to justify spending any more time than this in Nuevo Caracas anyway.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">La Quimera is bad, but it’s also a perfect example of how even something bad can have a bit of charm. The writing is cringey, the acting is embarrassing, and the middling but serviceable action tends to follow the same basic loop on repeat – but if some friends are riding this partially derailed train with you, there is still some fun to be found here. It doesn’t quite hit “so bad, it’s good” levels of jank, but it could still be a decent candidate for an evening of goofs. That said, even going into it with the right expectations, I wish there was any story resolution whatsoever, as La Quimera is clearly unfinished in more ways than one.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-shirt-kit-video-game-sponsors-sponsorship<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are two things I love more than anything else in this world: football and video games. <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sadly, I do not love football video games as much as I used to</a>, but that does not mean that I don't get to enjoy, and even occasionally get excited about, the two things coming together regardless.</p><p>See, my love of football (and of some overlapping stuff like fashion and design) has meant that over the years <a href="https://aftermath.site/japan-jfa-football-shirt-kit-fake-replica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've become a collector and just general appreciator of football shirts. For <em>my </em>teams, sure, but also just for any shirt that is cool, interesting or otherwise noteworthy</a>.</p><p>Which means that I've got a very soft spot for football shirts that also feature video games, and that usually means gaming companies appearing as as a sponsor on the front of the kit. A niche topic if ever there was one, but you'd be surprised how popular it is within many people's wheelhouses, coming up constantly in features and roundups on sports sites,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=Search&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_pJXrISEEeVNVk8GLcxCP4RXcCs&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNO_tWNuQZLGqwgog1QGZh8xJgb5yE_aJt61v-P_82HKj6IJMqbGywcaAvXhEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> online stores</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jaytomlinsfc/video/7470502102163361046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> and, uh,<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-strange-history-of-video-games-sponsoring-foo-5825815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> major video game websites</a>. Turns out loads of people who are into football shirts are also into video games!</p><p>The thing is, all those lists--and I include my own earlier effort here--end up being superficial at best, usually just covering a handful of shirts most fans are already aware of. That's boring, so I felt like settling in and making a more comprehensive roundup, covering as many leagues, teams and decades as I could find.</p><p>I'm not saying this is every shirt <em>ever made</em> that features a video game sponsorship, but...it's a lot.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/blogs/collectors-club/how-to-spot-a-fake-1998-fiorentina-shirt?srsltid=AfmBOoreo0VC4T6xzUOI2n8dkmmZph8H9Wpw750c3wmmXUsTB8avVEDd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Shirt Collective</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Fiorentina</strong></p><p>If you asked a casual observer what their favourite video game sponsorship is, or even just the one they thought was the most famous, Fiorentina's mid-90s Nintendo deal is normally the response. It's iconic, not just because it's Nintendo, but because the sponsor matches the club's colour scheme, and the team at the time could boast legends like Gabriel Batistuta.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.memorabilia.expert/shop/a-diego-maradona-game-used-10-sevilla-fc-home-shirt-19921993-spanish-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memorabilia</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Sevilla</strong></p><p>Again, it's Nintendo, and again, it matches the club's colours. Plus Diego Maradona wore it during his one-season spell at the Spanish side before his<a href="https://footballwhispers.com/blog/unforgettable-world-cup-moments-diego-maradonas-failed-drugs-test-in-1994/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ill-fated 1994 World Cup campaign</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/anorthosis/old-anorthosis-football-shirt-s91787.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Old Football Kits</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Anorthosis</strong></p><p>Hello, what's this? Well, this is an even earlier Nintendo sponsorship. In 1992 the company sponsored Cypriot club Anorthosis,<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/anorthosis/old-anorthosis-football-shirt-s91787.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who wore the above shirt in a two-legged tie against Juventus in the UEFA Cup</a>, which saw them lose 10-1 on aggregate. Ah well, at least the kit was great.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Kyoto Sanga FC</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Kyoto Sanga</strong></p><p>I've written extensively about this club and its ties with Nintendo, which run so deep (and feature everything from <em>Mario Sunshine</em> to <em>Splatoon</em>) I can't possibly condense them into a single paragraph.<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> So go read this instead</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=5835541976474021&amp;set=pcb.5835542096474009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Montpellier</strong></p><p>We're going to see a few PlayStation shirts in this roundup, but this Montpellier kit, for the original console, remains one of the nicest. Another French league club, Monaco,<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2877566/Jose-Mourinho-claims-Sir-Bobby-Robson-came-inch-signing-Thierry-Henry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> also had a PlayStation 1 sponsorship around the same time</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@classicfootballshirts/post/DFQUBVsMkYC/media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Auxerre</strong></p><p>There may have been others, but when it comes to French clubs and PlayStation sponsorship Auxerre is easily the most famous. The club's PlayStation contract spanned multiple consoles, from the PS1 through to the PS2, and this wetsuit-like away kit is probably my favourite.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://louloufootballshirt.com/produit/maillot-aj-auxerre-vintage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lou Lou</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Auxerre</strong></p><p>An epilogue! Auxerre and PlayStation went so hand-in-hand that in 2005-06 their Uhlsport kits went as far as moving the manufacturer's logo under the neck to accommodate a <em>second </em>PlayStation branding on the same shirt, this time for the PSP.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Seattle Sounders</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Seattle Sounders</strong></p><p>Few video game sponsorships have been as comprehensive as that between Microsoft and the Seattle Sounders, a club that wasn't just from the same city as the Xbox, but even shared the same volt green colour palette. Their deal, spanning several years, saw Sounders jerseys emblazoned with everything from Xbox to Game Pass to Xbox Live to individual games like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em>. More recently,<a href="https://www.versus.uk.com/articles/puma-and-xbox-link-up-to-kit-out-fresh-ego-fc-for-the-new-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Xbox also sponsored Fresh Ego FC</a>, a group that uses football "to raise awareness surrounding mental health and racism in football by bringing together top talent from sport and music".</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://thevault.co.uk/products/2000-02-arsenal-home-shirt-perfect-xl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Vault</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Arsenal</strong></p><p>Another classic, and if you didn't rank Fiorentina as the most famous video game sponsorship, you're probably saying this turn-of-the-millennium masterpiece in its place. But Sega's console didn't just grace the front of Henry, Bergkamp and co's shirts; in the same timeframe they also sponsored St Etienne, Deportivo de la Coruña and Sampdoria,<a href="https://www.le7sorelle.it/gb/sampdoria/577-SAMPDORIA-AWAY-JERSEY-ASICS-2000-2001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whose away shirt replaced Dreamcast with Dreamarena, the console's ill-fated online service</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/products/2001-02-arsenal-vintage-nike-away-football-shirt-jersey-l-sega" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Shirt Collective</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Arsenal</strong></p><p>As part of the same deal, not every shirt ended up bearing the Dreamcast logo; some (like this away kit) simply used Sega's branding instead. For a more recent example, in 2023 <a href="https://x.com/londonfalcons/status/1729085141514133779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sega sponsored London Falcons FC, an amateur LGBTQ+-friendly side</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://x.com/tottenhamshirts/status/1614629338879561729/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TottenhamShirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p><p>What's this? Arsenal's arch-rivals Tottenham sharing a sponsor? Not quite: in the mid-90s Spurs were sponsored by Holsten, a beer company, so the club's juniors kits had to bear the logo of a company that was a bit more child-friendly. Also, this contract was up before Sega's appearance on Arsenal's kits. This same conundrum was repeated 20 years later, when Crystal Palace, at the time sponsored by an online casino,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.com/2017-18-crystal-palace-home-shirt-910-lboys-cplh17242jr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> got an EA Sports sponsorship for their junior sides</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.topvintagefootballshirts.com/product/33126248/1993-94-chelsea-maglia-amiga-umbro-l-top-?lang=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Vintage</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chelsea</strong></p><p>In early 90s Chelsea were sponsored by Commodore, and would wear the logos of both the parent company as well as its Amiga computer. I've chosen Amiga for the photo here because other clubs wore the Commodore branding first, and better....</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/products/1984-89-bayern-munich-vintage-adidas-home-ls-football-shirt-m-commodore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Shirt Collective</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Bayern Munich</strong></p><p>...and one of those clubs was German powerhouses Bayern Munich, whose white Commodore sponsors in the mid-80s looked incredible on those all-red shirts. Bayern also wore an Amiga shirt, <a href="https://www.trikotinsel.de/en/Adidas-FC-Bayern-Munich--jersey-1988-89-Kiss-me-Amiga-home-men-s-S-M-L-XL-XXL-4792-4851.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but only for a single match, in 1988 against VfB Stuttgart</a>.</p><p>It should be noted that PSG also had Commodore sponsorship for a while,<a href="https://en.psg.fr/teams/club/content/paris-saint-germain-dip-into-their-short-yet-rich-history-to-relaunch-a-selection-of-their-most-emblematic-shirts-2021-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> resulting in some fantastic colour-matching on the shirts</a>, as did<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/auxerre/old-auxerre-football-shirt-s87649.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the already-mentioned Auxerre in the early 90s</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://footballandvintageamsterdam.com/product/manchester-city-home-shirt-1999-2001-in-small/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football &amp; Vintage</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p><p>In the late-90s Manchester City struck a deal with British publisher Eidos, the company behind <em>Tomb Raider</em>, the original <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>. </p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Classic Football Shirts</figcaption></figure><p><strong>FC Martigues</strong></p><p>FC Martigues, a team in France's second division, were once sponsored not by Ocean, the once-mighty British publisher, but one of Ocean's games in particular: the PC version of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, not to be confused with the SNES version, <em>or </em>the Mega Drive version, as all three were different games. What makes this even more interesting is that for the white away shirt they just...made the <em>Jurassic Park</em> logo bigger and replaced the club's crest with Ocean's logo, something that would be gross even by today's standards.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/camisas_vieira/" target="_blank">camisas_vieira</a>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cerezo Osaka</strong></p><p>Japanese side Cerezo Osaka have had a long relationship with hometown heroes Capcom, which in recent years has seen the publisher's logo appear everywhere from training shirts to shorts. Their 90s kits, though, with Capcom on the front and back of the shirt, are obviously the most famous.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/t/tokyo-verdy/old-tokyo-verdy-football-shirt-s73862.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Old Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Tokyo Verdy</strong></p><p>Another Japanese club with a famous video game collaboration was Tokyo Verdy in the 90s, who had Konami sponsorships on the sleeves, the front of the kit and sometimes, like above, both at the same time.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Lazio</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Lazio</strong></p><p>I hate this sponsorship so much. It's so <em>lazy</em>--looking like someone just dragged the game's logo.png onto a shirt and hit "print", without any thought to scale or colours--but also it's Lazio,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1bz5ni9/where_does_lazios_reputation_as_a_club_filled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and fuck Lazio</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Konami</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Corinthians</strong></p><p>A decade later than Lazio's deal, Brazilian side Corinthians also did a sponsorship with Konami for <em>PES2019</em>, which included a licensing deal for the game itself (see above). Note that the <em>PES </em>logo is for some reason at the bottom of the shirt, making it only visible if a player's jersey was untucked. Fellow Brazilian side Sao Paolo had a similar <em>PES </em>sponsorship that year, too.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://x.com/JLeagueShirts/status/1677507401799565312/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>JEF United</strong></p><p>Back to Japan! JEF United have had a few shirts with Sega sponsorship, some with just the logo, others also featuring Sonic. Not for any game in particular, just because he's Sonic. I like this keeper shirt worn between 1993-1995 the best.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/2004-06-afc-wimbledon-away-shirt-810-m-wima04745336.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AFC Wimbledon</strong></p><p>Sports Interactive, developers of the <em>Football Manager</em> series, sponsored AFC Wimbledon between 2002-2023, sometimes using their own logo, other times that of the game. <em>Football Manager</em> also appeared on Watford's kits in 2012.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Swindon Town</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Swindon Town</strong></p><p>Swindon Town--a club that has spent most of the last two decades in the lower two divisions of English league football--had a prominent <em>FIFA </em>sponsorship on the front of their kits for a few years through the 2010s, enough to land them on many of these kinds of roundups, though they weren't actually the first,<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/accrington-stanley/old-accrington-stanley-football-shirt-s13585.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that honour going to Accrington Stanley in 2006</a><a href="https://www.footballkitarchive.com/mansfield-town-2007-08-away-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and Mansfield Town in 2007</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Club America</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Club America</strong></p><p>This is a fresh one! Bandai Namco<a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/pac-man-and-club-america-kick-off-a-game-changing-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> had a one-off sponsorship deal with Club America earlier this month</a>, and it's one of the best: holographic player names and numbers, full of <em>Pac-Man</em> visuals, looked amazing, and the club's crest was temporarily changed to include <em>Pac-Man</em> as well.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://x.com/classicshirts/status/1359165961409097730/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Football Shirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Lyon</strong></p><p>For a while in the early 2000s French side Lyon were sponsored by Infogrames, a publisher which at the time was using Atari as a sub-label for their publishing operations. So Atari would sometimes feature on Lyon's kits as well (Infogrames would later rebrand to Atari in 2003).</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://x.com/ATMShirts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ATLshirts</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Atletico Madrid </strong></p><p>For one season in the mid-90s, Atletico Madrid were sponsored by Bandai, which was cool, but even cooler was the fact that for a single game--the Madrid derby with rivals Real--they wore a Tamagotchi kit instead.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: EA Sports</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Premier League Referees</strong></p><p>Not strictly a playing kit, but close enough: for years now EA Sports has had a deal with the Premier League where combinations of EA Sports, <em>FIFA </em>and now <em>EAFC </em>logos have appeared on official's uniforms.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Stevenage</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Stevenage Town</strong></p><p>I hate the Lazio + <em>PES </em>deal the <em>most </em>for political reasons, but Stevenage Town's pathetic Prime Gaming sponsorship from a few years back comes a very close second. It's just so boring. It's a pointless service, and even the sponsorship application itself is cheap, looking more like an iron-on transfer. In case you were wondering if things have improved since, Stevenage are currently sponsored by another video game company...<a href="https://xsolla.prezly.com/stevenage-fc-announces-landmark-partnership-with-xsolla-as-gaming--kit-sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xsolla, a games-focused payments and commerce platform</a>. Boring!</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Burnley</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Burnley</strong></p><p>When English football started allowing sleeve sponsorships a few years back, mobile publishers like Playdemic were all over it, pushing games like <em>Golf Crash </em>on Burnley's kit. I like that this photo features Matt Lowton on the right,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZy8R3F66aM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who while at Villa scored one of the best goals for a terrible side you will ever see</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Everton</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Everton </strong></p><p>See above. While <em>Golf Crush</em> made it look like every Burnley kit was on deep discount at Sports Direct, at least Everton's <em>Angry Birds</em> deal managed to match the rest of the shirt.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/226682373857?itmmeta=01JSK56A4JEGZMY07TKKW985VJ&amp;hash=item34c75286e1:g:8AAAAOSwOt5n76RA&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4MHg7L1Zz0LA5DYYmRTS30lSHNMmfrhfzGznhwfFwb9vwJ0ZsF4VD9yaW7fg7nkI%2FyvDvdT3fsY8tFXKi13UT9htxzLrjc%2F2J1zimG4gHu1Ly3WNBsTGwYe3ZEpKsrMMuleqAqGNG6h9IKz%2FrSWH%2FHuvZutvvOMDpo2zniDhze7%2Br5%2BZqzREU2Oq89fHhZEuK0i6XTXJZZSI0UwMGiGNNPABjmIkI1KnpZHU44EJsCT9cVzI3XMf40caTPMpAWXGfmL4Yepby3qTbg%2FJwsGshdo9lDkCBE6EUgjLTgH9xML9%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-SimeXMZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eBay</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Leyton Orient</strong></p><p>For two seasons, between 1995-1997, English club Leyton Orient were sponsored by Acclaim, the publisher riding high with hits like <em>NBA Jam</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. It should be noted that Orient<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjqSXMRDAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> were not riding quite as high at the time</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Charly</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Liga MX</strong></p><p>In 2024 Activision made a deal with both a sportswear manufacturer (Charly) and six sides playing in Mexico's Liga MX, which saw each Charly team wear special shirts emblazoned with <em>Call of Duty</em> graphics. Note there were no specific Activision or even <em>Call of Duty</em> logos used; instead each shirt had a sublimated print of stuff like a camouflage pattern or skull logo from the series.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Athletic Club</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Athletic Club</strong></p><p>Another recent one! Earlier this month Spanish side Athletic Club, aka Athletic Bilbao, wore <em>The Last Of Us</em> branding for two games, one across the chest, another on their sleeves. While this is <em>technically </em>for the TV show, it's a TV show based very closely on a video game, so I'm going to allow it.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/auction/345459864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo!

This time with another limited sponsorship, from the 2004-2005 season, where the team wore a variety of movie tie-ins (<a href="https://www.nss-sports.com/en/lifestyle/28434/spiderman-paris-atletico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including the famous Spider-Man shirt</a>). One of those movies was <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, which for the same rules as <em>The Last Of Us</em> above, I'm going to allow.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Stonewall FC</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Stonewall FC</strong></p><p>In 2020 EA Sports began sponsoring Stonewall FC, "the world's most successful LGBT+ football club", a deal that continues to this day. Some shirts have featured the EA Sports logo, others that of EA Sports FC, and the club's full range of kits usually combine to form (or are, like the shirt above, simply in) the colours of the trans flag. They rule.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: Juventus</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Juventus</strong></p><p>Cygames, the Japanese developer behind games like <em>Granblue Fantasy</em>, has been sponsoring Juventus for a few seasons now, and recently renewed the deal to extend until at least 2026.</p><hr><figure><figcaption>Image: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Santos</strong></p><p>For the Copa Libertadores final in 2021, Brazilian club Santos signed a one-off sponsorship with Epic Games that saw <em>Fortnite's </em>logo placed centrally (among loads of other sponsors) on the front of their kits.

			<p>Apple and Epic Games have had bad ties for the past few years, especially after the latter introduced an alternative payment method that got it banned from the App Store. After years of lawsuits and rulings, Apple was ruled to be in violation of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-appeals-in-epic-games-lawsuit-wants-app-store-changes-delay/">2021 injunction</a> that required developers to redirect users to third-party purchase options on the web through dedicated in-app links. In response, Epic Games CEO and founder stated on X that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store next week while offering Apple a proposal that could go in its favor in the long run.</p>
<h2>Epic proposes ending all legal disputes if Apple agrees to drop its 27 percent commission on external web transactions following the court ruling</h2>
<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers has been handling the Apple vs. Epic Games battle for the past five years, and the latest remarks suggest that Apple is in "willful violation" of the 2021 injunction, which was provisioned to prevent anticompetitive behavior in the market. The ruling reads: "Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated." While Apple did allow developers to put an in-app link that would direct users to the web for payment, it also took a 12 to 27 percent cut from the transaction.</p>
<p>Epic Games escalated the scene, stating that the iPhone maker should be held in contempt of court for falling behind in complying with the order regarding the fee structure. Apple claimed it was already completely compliant with the injunction, but the judge took Epic's side. You can check out the 80-page order <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>To summarize: One, after trial, the Court found that Apple's 30 percent commission "allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins" and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple's response: charge a 27 percent commission (again tied to nothing) on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple's goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>Two, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple's response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page "scare" screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple's goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judge Rogers also stated that the court "will not tolerate further delays" and that the company will not impede the competition. This means that the company should allow developers to communicate with the end-user, offering transactions outside of the app with an amended fee structure for transactions. You can check out the ruling below, which is effective immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app, and as a consequence thereof, no reason exists to audit, monitor, track or require developers to report purchases or any other activity that consumers make outside an app;</li>
<li>Restricting or conditioning developers' style, language, formatting, quantity, flow or placement of links for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Prohibiting or limiting the use of buttons or other calls to action, or otherwise conditioning the content, style, language, formatting, flow or placement of these devices for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Excluding certain categories of apps and developers from obtaining link access;</li>
<li>Interfering with consumers' choice to proceed in or out of an app by using anything other than a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site;</li>
<li>Restricting a developer's use of dynamic links that bring consumers to a specific product page in a logged-in state rather than to a statically defined page, including restricting apps from passing on product details, user details or other information that refers to the user intending to make a purchase.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The court has referred the case to the United States Attorney for the North District of California, allowing it to "investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate." Tim Sweeney took to X to share his thoughts on the ruling, stating that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store in the United States next week. However, he also proposed that Epic Games would "drop all current and future litigation" if Apple complies with the ruling.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.</p>
<p>Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. <a href="https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv">https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv</a></p>
<p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen whether Apple will challenge the ruling and keep the case an ongoing fiasco or will finally succumb and introduce new policies and drop the off-app transaction fee for developers. The move could end Apple's quarrel with Epic and hurt its revenue from its services. As we speak, Apple's Services revenue is a quarter of the total, and it could give all developers a nudge to shift their payment methods outside the app. We will keep you updated with the latest, so keep an eye out.</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em>&nbsp;also reports that one of the two incubation projects Respawn has canceled was an extraction shooter set within the Titanfall universe. As an incubation project, the title was very early in development. EA issued a statement about the layoffs, saying in part:</p>

<p>"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected – their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Original Story:</strong> </em>Respawn Entertainment, the developer behind Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series, has announced layoffs due to internal changes to its development pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">statement</a>, the developer says it is making “adjustments” to its Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi teams, the latter of which is currently working on a follow-up to 2023’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. The developer has also ceased development of two “early-stage incubation projects.”</p>

<p>These changes have resulted in layoffs for an unknown number of staff. Respawn states it will offer “meaningful support” to affected employees, including finding new opportunities within publisher EA.</p>

<p>“Looking ahead, our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged,” says Respawn. “Innovation has always been at the core of Respawn’s identity, and it continues to drive how we build the future – from evolving live experiences to crafting new worlds and stories.”</p>

<p>The game’s launch date has been bumped up to September 12. The announcement was seemingly posted earlier than intended, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lnxicudw3e2c">video</a> of Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford announcing the date that was quickly taken down before Gearbox officially revealed the news about an hour later. Regardless, it’s always nice to see a game arrive earlier than expected rather than being delayed.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 was first revealed at Gamescom 2024. Set on the planet Kairos, players control four new Vault Hunters to hunt for riches while battling the planet’s tyrannical dictator, the Timekeeper. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A Switch 2 version is slated to arrive sometime this year.&nbsp;</p>
