          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the next big Switch 2 game, landing firmly within "launch window" status next month. Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said "Donkey Kong lore" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City. In this game she looks no more than 10 years old or so and hangs off DK's back as a companion character. Pauline has a dream, and DK is being exploited by his capitalist overlords, so together they head toward the planet core to make a wish. All completely normal so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the presence of a young Pauline implies that this is a prequel of sorts. DK has been rehabilitated from his villainous persona in the original Donkey Kong for years, but buddying up with Pauline as a little girl suggests that there was more to the story than we knew. As of the time when DK grabbed her and carried her to the top of a tower and forced Jump Man (aka Mario) to rescue her, they had a history. They were old friends! The mind reels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074"></a><figcaption>In Soviet Russia, monkey has person on his back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But then, the Bananza presentation threw another curveball by revealing that you can meet Cranky Kong. Now wait just a damn minute. What the hell is going on here?</p><p dir="ltr">As DK enthusiasts may recall, Cranky Kong is canonically the <em>original</em> Donkey Kong: The DK we've been playing throughout the Donkey Kong Country games, the one who is pals with Diddy Kong and the rest, is actually his more charismatic grandson. It was Cranky Kong who grabbed Pauline and climbed the tower and squared off against Jump Man.</p><p dir="ltr">So you may start to see the problem here. If old Cranky Kong is in this game, Pauline should be an adult. If Pauline is a kid, then Donkey Kong should be a slightly younger Cranky Kong who, 10 or so years in the future, will grab her and climb a bunch of girders. Having a fully-aged Cranky Kong and a young girl Pauline appear in the same game makes <em>absolutely no sense</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are ways to make it work. Donkey Kong Bananza could imply some kind of time-travel element in which Cranky Kong was sucked back into the past to meet his younger self. That possibility seems bananas, but frankly no more so than anything else we've seen from this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The more likely possibility in my mind, though, is that this version of Donkey Kong, Pauline, and Cranky Kong are entirely separate and distinct from the precious original continuity. Donkey Kong Bananza appears to be a sort of DK reboot, remixing familiar elements into a new continuity that is not bound by any of the storytelling conventions of the original. In other words: We've entered the DK multiverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe Nintendo is just making it up as they go. I may be overthinking this.</p>

The movie is being billed as similar in tone to the adult-focused anime movies like Predator: Killer of Killers and the upcoming John Wick animated prequel.</p><p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," Guzikowski said.</p><p>Line Mileage is producing the Death Stranding anime.

During the showcase, we learned a lot about the game, including that the Odd Rock companion from previous trailers is none other than aspiring singer Pauline, alongside details about Donkey Kong's various Bananza forms, the evil Void Company, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donkey Kong makes the discovery of the century on Ingot Isle in the form of special golden bananas, but just <span>as he's about to enjoy all that potassium, a sudden tempest over the island sends him deep into the underground. Here, through extraordinary circumstances, he teams up with Odd Rock, who we learn is actually Pauline, a character whose lineage goes way back to Donkey Kong's beginnings. The duo learns that if they reach the planet's core, they will be granted a wish: Pauline wants to become a singer, and Donkey Kong wants to enjoy the golden bananas. So the two set off into the underground core.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nintendo says each layer of the underground presents a new biome and unique scenery to enjoy, and if today's Direct is any indication, we can expect lava stages, ice ones, tropical levels, and more. As the two venture through layers of the planet, they discover Banandium Gems, which are golden bananas you'll find throughout the game. Some are simply visible and easy to collect; others are buried in walls, the ground, and elsewhere, and Donkey Kong will have to use his various moves to collect them. You can even receive them as rewards for completing Ancient Ruin challenges, which include time-limited battles, obstacle courses, side-scrolling stages, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And speaking of moves, Donkey Kong has all kinds of tools in his arsenal in Donkey Kong Bananza.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Donkey Kong and Pauline's Moveset</span></h3><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span>He can punch and smash through enemies, the ground, and most things he can get his hands on with incredible force. This destruction can lead to special discoveries or set off chain reactions that can drastically change the scenery around you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dive Punch lets Donkey Kong smash deep into the ground, while Roll Forward lets him roll at high speeds, which can be combined with jumps and punches, to extend traversal mechanics. With Hand Slap, Donkey Kong can collect nearby items and discover hidden ones using Sonar. Tear Off lets Donkey Kong grab a chunk of terrain and, well, tear it off. He can then throw this chunk at enemies or the environment to discover new pathways. Tearing turnips out of the ground will also lead to finding new items. Chunk Jump can be used to double jump and reach new heights. It's clear there's a lot of discoverability and exploration tied to chaining together Donkey Kong's various moves, and I'm excited to see what kind of tech players make of this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you throw chunks of softer material, you can stick them to surfaces and pile them up, helping you reach new heights and secret areas. And finally, Donkey Kong's Turf Surf lets you slide through levels on chunks of terrain, carving out new paths and taking out enemies along the way. Pauline has her own powers, too, including Make Music; with this, Pauline can show you the way forward and remove strange seals left behind by the evil Void Company.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Collectibles</span></h3>

<p><span>&nbsp;As you work through the environment, you'll discover not only Banandium Gems, which lead to Skill Points that you can use for different upgrades like better sonar and stronger punches, but Banandium Chips, too. These banana slices can be traded for Banandium Gems at the Chip Exchange. You can exchange the Gold you find in your adventures at the Stuff Shop for useful items, and you can trade Fossils at local style shops for additional outfits and more for Donkey Kong and Pauline. Both Donkey and Pauline can be customized with different outfits, and you can even change the color of Donkey Kong's fur.&nbsp;</span></p><p>You can find additional Banandium Gems and Fossils by opening up Treasure Chests, which contain Treasure Maps that lead to these collectibles and more. Today's Direct revealed that the game tracks which Fossils and Banandium Gems you've collected, too, making it easy to stay on top of what you need to do if you're looking to find everything.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bananza Forms and The Void Company</h3>

<p>Donkey Kong will get help from the DK family, including Cranky Kong and his rhino companion, Rambi, and the Giant Elders that call the subterranean home. These Elders possess ancient powers that Pauline can help Donkey Kong utilize. If you collect enough gold, your Bananergy meter will fill up, and once it's full, you can transform into different Bananza forms, including the massive gorilla Kong Bananza, the speedy Zebra Bananza, and the flying Ostrich Bananza form. There's likely even more forms waiting in the full game. These forms have limited use, and you'll need to fill up your Bananergy meter to use them again. However, you can swap forms on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>These Bananza forms will be essential to taking down the Void Company, "the mightiest mining operation both above ground and below," according to Nintendo. Grumpy Kong creates gigantic corporate soldiers, while Poppy Kong is responsible for subterranean information <span>gathering. Void Kong is in charge of both of them and the entire company, and this company is behind the banana-stealing maelstrom threatening Ingot Isle. The company has blocked off routes to the lower layers to stop anyone wishing to thwart their plans to reach the core and receive a wish. Donkey Kong and his pals will face off against massive enemies guarding these sealed routes, and you'll need to utilize Donkey Kong's entire arsenal of moves to defeat them.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Getting Around</span></h3>

<p><span>As you progress through Ingot Isle's underground, you might want to double back for collectibles and more. Subterranean Eels (Eelevators) can be used to fast travel between different layers, and they can also "Teeleport" you to different areas within a single layer, too. When you need a break from the action, find a bed for a quick (and sleepy) getaway.

<p><span>If you're looking for some co-op fun, Donkey Kong Bananza includes plenty of ways to do that. You can share a second Joy-Con 2 controller, or a second set entirely, to let another person control Pauline separately from Donkey Kong. They can unleash Vocal Blasts using the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls. And with GameShare, you only need one copy of the game because you can share the game to another player on their Switch 2 to get them in on the action. This can be done locally, even to a Switch 1 player, or via an online connection using GameShare via GameChat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you need extra help in the game, the Assist Mode will automatically guide you toward the objective and halve the damage you receive.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Outside the main game, there's a mode called DK Artist, reminiscent of the Super Mario 64 title screen. Here, you can use Joy-Con 2 mouse control to rotate a sculpture of Donkey Kong, carve material out of him (or add some back on), paint it, and more. The Direct shows off unique Donkey Kong sculptures and<span> others inspired by art in the real world. You can change the lighting, too, and add special effects for a quick photo op.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Amiibo</span></h3>

<p>Mortal Kombat 1</p>

</article>
<p><em>Variety</em> states it has confirmed with Warner Bros. that there were no layoffs or executive departures as a result of the restructuring. Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-split-two-companies-streaming-tv-1236423250/">announced</a> it would be split into two publicly traded companies to combat declining business: WBD Global Networks and WBD Streaming &amp; Studios. The games division now sits under the latter umbrella, which is led by CEO David Zaslav. &nbsp;</p><p>This restructuring comes on the heels of what’s been a tumultuous year for Warner Bros. Games. Despite the massive success of titles like 2023’s Hogwarts Legacy, it has since endured the significant commercial failures of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/a-new-report-details-how-a-troubled-development-led-to-suicide-squad-kill-the">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and, to a lesser extent, MultiVersus and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions. Mortal Kombat 1, despite <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mortal-kombat-1-sales-top-5-million-copies-as-netherrealm-keeps-trucking-forward-">selling over 5 million copies</a> since its launch last September, was also considered an underwhelming sales performer compared to previous entries. All four games launched in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Warner Bros. <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/WBD-1Q25-Earnings-Release.pdf">Q1 2025 financial report</a> stated revenue in the games division decreased 48 percent, naming Suicide Squad's failure as one of the primary factors. Former Warner Bros. Games chief David Haddad stepped down from the company in January. A month later, in February, the publisher shut down three of its games studios: MultiVersus developer Player First Games (after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/24/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer">acquiring it</a> less than a year prior), Middle-earth/F.E.A.R. developer Monolith Productions (resulting in the cancelation of its in-development <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2021/2021/12/09/monolith-open-world-wonder-woman-game-in-the-works">Wonder Woman game</a>), and support studio Warner Bros. Games San Diego.</p><p>As for what's next in the pipeline, Warner Bros. Games recently launched Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition and announced a mobile RPG called DC World Collide. A Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy arrived on June 5. Beyond this, its future slate of titles is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/"><em>Variety</em></a>]</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a Direct presentation, Nintendo detailed more on how the new game will play, beyond the punching and rock deformation previously shown.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong is joined by a little purple rock companion during Bananza, but now Nintendo has revealed this character is in fact baby Pauline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline's inclusion was accidentally leaked by Nintendo</a> itself back in April, but now her role in the game has been officially unveiled.</p>
<p>Pauline is the damsel in distress in the original Donkey Kong game, meaning her inclusion here is not only a fun throwback, but means Bananza could act as something of a prequel.</p>
<p>She's more recently been seen as the mayor of New Donk City in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, singing the theme song Jump Up, Super Star! (as well as a rather <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-8-deluxes-final-wave-of-dlc-arrives-next-week">sassy inclusion as a racer in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's DLC</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mario-kart-world-character-tier-list">more recently also in Mario Kart World</a>).</p>
<p>It's her singing ability that characterises Pauline's inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza. By learning songs acquired from the Giant Elders (who look to be musically themed), Pauline can sing to transform Donkey Kong. These transformations include a zebra to run over water and an ostrich to fly and reach hard to reach areas, though they'll require gold to build up Bananergy.</p>
<p>The Direct also includes multiple vocal songs, presumably sung by Pauline. She can also be controlled by a second player in co-operative mode.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>DK's new antagonists | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The antagonists of the game, meanwhile, are the Void Company: Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong, and leader Void Kong. This trio is responsible for stealing DK's bananas, beginning the game's story. Cranky Kong and his rhino Rambi will also feature.</p>
<p>As DK explores (and destroys) more of the subterranean worlds, he'll collect Banandium Gems - the big golden bananas. These are found by exploring, or by completing challenges in hidden Ruins, and are used to improve stats. The independent Ruin arenas, along with the free-form exploration, hint at an almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>-esque influence (though progress is more linear).</p>
<p>Other inclusions in Donkey Kong Bananza are multiple outfits for both DK and Pauline (each with benefits), fossils to collect, a music player to enjoy Pauline's singing from the soundtrack, and a photo mode.</p>
<p>And… was that the DK Rap?! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Composer Grant Kirkhope previously explained to Eurogamer why he wasn't credited for the song's inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, but it's inclusion in this new game is a surprise.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will also include an Assist Mode, just like the most recent DK platformers on Switch, to make gameplay a little easier.</p>
<p>Another slightly odd addition is DK Artist mode, where players can carve Donkey Kong's face using the Switch 2's mouse mode. It reminds me of the Mario face-pulling in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, a Donkey Kong and Pauline amiibo figure is on the way to celebrate the game's release, while DK-themed amiibo support will have some fun benefits in-game.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," wrote former Eurogamer editor Tom Phillips during his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>The game will release on Switch 2 on 17th July, yet already some fans have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">deciphered its secret language</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo revealed a whole fistful of new info about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> in a new Nintendo Direct, the 3D platformer reboot coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 17th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?start=1894&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Golden bananas are, apparently, the discovery of the century, with Ingot Island the hub for mining operations at the very start of the game. And then the baddies show up. In the resulting kerfuffle, DK teams up with Odd-Rock… except it turns out that within that rock is noneother than Pauline, whose been reimagined as a wannabe singer.</p>
<p>The solution to both their wishes and woes –&nbsp;that is wanting bananas and stardom and not having them, respectively –&nbsp;is to go deeper and deeper underground to try to reach the planet’s core. Digging down through the ground reveals a world filled with subterranean biomes layered on top of one another, all somehow still being lit by the sun. It definitely doesn’t really feel like you’re underground when DK is rampaging across a sunny beach…</p>
<p>DK can run, jump and climb up and around pretty much anything, but he can also smash, grab and bash. He can punch his way through and deform vast swathes of the world, digging through the world and wrecking stuff on the way. All of this destruction can lead to new discoveries.</p>

<p>DK has a powerful Dive Punch move to punch down through the ground, do a forward roll to move at pace, hand slap (or foot slap) to collect nearby items and reveal a sonar pulse, and tear up chunks of terrain and stuck items, and then swing it at enemies. Heck, he can even jump while holding a chunk and then use it to propel him to a double jump, or Turf Surf</p>
<p>Intriguingly there’s a toughness value for the various objects. Tougher materials can smash through lighter stuff more easily, while softer materials could be blobbed together. Of course, explosive materials will go boom and blow great big holes and craters in the world.</p>
<p>All of this also applies to the battling as well, with some enemies having tough exteriors to smash through to get to their inner forms and be defeated.</p>
<p>Pauline isn’t just along for the ride, clinging onto DK’s shoulder, and her singing can break through certain purple seals blocking progression.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of creatures of different species that you’ll meet on the way, and Cranky Kong and Rambi are knocking around in these underground layers. Each world is looked over by a Giant Elder, each of which possess a Bananza Power that Pauline can learn to sing, transforming DK into even more destructive forms, such as Kong Bananza, the speedy Zebra Bananza, and the flying Ostrich Bananza (who can also drop egg bombs from above).All of this is time limited and requires you to collect enough gold to fill up your Bananergy.</p>
<p>The Void Company is what stands in your way, with Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong and Void Kong the evil trio who are racing you to the planet core. They’ve created a bunch of powerful foes to guard the routes down to the lower layers, which you’ll obviously need to defeat.</p>
<p>The Banandium Gems are the most prized golden banana gem collectibles, either found in the open world or earned from completing challenges that include combat challenges, side-scrolling platformer sections, and much more. These Gems can be spent to increase DK’s stats and power of his abilities, like improved sonar or new skills.</p>
<p>A 2-player co-op mode allows the second player to control Pauline in an asymmetrical co-op mode, so she can shout and blast enemies in a mode similar to Super Mario Galaxy co-op on the Wii. This all works via GameShare, as well.</p>
<p>And then there’s just a random mouse mode called DK Artist, letting you carve and paint your own sculptures.</p>
<p>It all looks significantly more ambitious and intriguing than the smaller slice of game that was on show during the April Direct and Switch 2 hands on events. We’re definitely keen to see more when the game launched next month on 17th July.</p>

			<p>Our world is eternally on a knife’s edge, separated from demon incursion by the thinnest of membranes. If you’ve played anything remotely Persona-adjacent, you will know this well — it’s the core premise of all Megami Tensei games, and Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is no different.</p>
<p><iframe title="Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxVXcGlpDHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the name not really giving it away, this is technically a remaster of Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army. Tell me your game is Japanese without telling me it’s Japanese, in 11 words or more, if you please…</p>


<p>While SMTDSRKvtSA is technically the third game in the series, you don’t need to have played the first two, especially as this game kicks off with Raidou becoming Raidou. Once you get past the tutorial, where you learn how to swing a sword, fire a pistol and ultimately summon a demon (or a devil, as the terms are used interchangeably throughout the game for no reason whatsoever), you are bestowed the moniker Raidou Kuzunoha XIV.</p>
<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> of your name, Raidou of clan Kuzunoha is always the last line of defence, living in the shadows so that humanity can live in the light, blissfully ignorant of the horrors behind the veil. Your boss, the three-legged crow god Yatagarasu (an occasional demon you can befriend in the SMT/Persona games), tasks you with becoming a detective in the capital, Tokyo, and helping those plagued by the supernatural in the fictional year Taisho 20 (Showa 5 or 1931 in our timeline, since Emperor Taisho died in 1926).</p>


<p>It’s a really cool premise, and this is a great Atlus title if you’re in the market for something shorter than the usual 120h+ romp that is the Persona series. Fans will recognise all the usual mechanics, from demon fusion to the effective mascot Jack Frost, which are always welcome. As with the other SMT games, the ability to chat to demons is also back, with some actively giving you side missions as you go about your quest.</p>
<p>So what is that quest, exactly? You are asked by a young lady to kill her before she is abducted by some mysterious, red-cloaked demons. Instead, you set about trying to find and rescue her, as mysterious forces (and plenty of zombies) stand in your way.</p>
<p>This brings us to combat, which is always a core part of SMT-adjacent games. Along with the usual demon capture and negotiation stuff, we have a completely new take on battle.</p>

<p>Rather than the usual turn-based combat, each encounter is a real-time melee; you have up to two demons at your side, who automatically attack enemies, drawing on your MP to cast powerful spells. Your mana is constantly replenishing as you attack, meaning that you are actually more of a support character in all but the boss fights. This is where the tactics really come into it; Raidou has access to some basic elemental magic and can command his demons to perform specific actions, but having an army at your disposal with different strengths and weaknesses, and adjusting Raidou’s build to the task at hand, is vital to your success.</p>
<p>This all helps combat feel fresh and fluid, especially when you consider the regenerating MP bar is new to the remaster. Previously, you’d have to stop and rest to recover your MP, which seriously threw off the pacing. Now, you feel like an unstoppable badass, and truly worthy of a name as epic as Raido Kuzunoha XIV.</p>
<p>But for all its fluidity, combat also has a massive flaw: there is little to no point in using heavy attacks, as the light attacks are the only ones that drain MP. There is no way your heavy attack will come close to what these demons put out when they’re throwing massive fireballs across the room, and if you can have literal Thor summoning lightning bolts at an enemy that’s weak to lighting, you’re going to want to have all the MP that Thor requires, aren’t you? Trust me when I say you can get through the whole game &nbsp;without using heavy attacks.</p>

<p>So how does the rest of the game play out? I’m pleased to say, very well.</p>
<p>It’s an intriguing and morish story, backed by an excellent, funky soundtrack. It’s great fun exploring Tokyo and using your demons to solve problems, whether that’s Alp reading people’s minds and whispering in your ear or Obariyon punching a car out of the way so you can pass. The characters you meet are colourful and the world seems pretty well lived in. The story is too short to say any more than this, sadly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also a few areas that are a little shaky — the graphics are gorgeous when in cutscenes, but far from perfect the rest of the time. The eyes are stylised, so we can overlook that, but the teeth are just jarring.</p>

<p>There’s also the curious inclusion of a poorly explained lunar system and the mahjong mini game that was cut from Western releases of SMTDSRKvtSA. The game simply assumes you know how to play mahjong and runs with it — while there are explanations if you go digging in your cat’s journal, Raidou Remastered does a poor job of explaining mahjong. As someone who has played a lot of card games over the years, and sat down watching YouTube videos on how to play mahjong, I was still left flummoxed as to how it worked in Raidou.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have minor gripes like the game giving scant detail when you fuse or meet a new demon — all of which have real-world mythology that the kind of people who like these games like knowing about. A few times I found myself pausing the game to look up a new demon on Wikipedia because I couldn’t find the in-game bio. But all told, these aren’t things that should hold you back from playing.</p>

<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155151/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Never let it be said that Atlus is afraid of finding new ways to capitalise on its flagship <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> franchise—for quite a while now, there have been significantly more spinoff ‘SMT-adjacent’ games than mainline entries. Still, that’s certainly not a bad thing, as the company has clearly come up with a lot of fun and interesting approaches to the tried and true JRPG gameplay, whether through the turn-based SRPG style of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/shin_megami_tensei_devil_survivor_overclocked">Devil Survivor</a> or the action-RPG flavour of <strong>Raidou</strong>.</p>
<p>The first Raidou game, <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, came out back in 2006 for the PS2 and was itself a spinoff of the Devil Summoner series for the Sega Saturn. Blending action-focused gameplay with an interesting 1930s-inspired alternate universe setting, it stood out to fans of the broader franchise, even if Raidou’s modest sales also ensured that it never caught on in the same way <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Persona</a> did.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156945/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, Atlus is giving this lost classic another shot with a comprehensive remaster treatment for modern platforms, billed as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>. Though there are some aspects of it showing their age, Atlus has overall done an excellent job of making Raidou shine in the best possible light.</p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way, Raidou Remastered really strains the definition of what a ‘remaster’ can be, in a good way. Atlus wasn’t content to just give this one a cheap resolution bump and a couple quality-of-life updates. Even though it’s clear that this was ultimately built on the bones of a PS2 game, many aspects of Raidou have been thoroughly reevaluated and redesigned to make for an overall more enjoyable and modern feeling game. Some fans of the original may baulk at changes to the combat system or demon fusion, but I think all the tweaks and additions here have sanded down most of those rougher and antiquated design elements that made the original such a product of its time.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156932/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For its story, Raidou Remastered places you in the role of Raidou Kuzunoha XIV, a fresh teenage graduate of a mysterious organisation of Devil Summoners who live in the shadows to protect the world from supernatural danger by using their otherworldly connections. Raidou (and his talking cat companion, Gouto) is assigned to Tokyo to study and work at a detective agency while he keeps an eye on things there, and soon finds himself unravelling a broader conspiracy after working a kidnapping case in which a legion of red-uniformed soldiers spirits away a teenage girl.</p>
<p>It's a much darker narrative than you’d find in a Persona game, but not quite as dark as something from mainline SMT, and I really appreciated how downright <em>wacky</em> it gets the farther in you go. And while the overall plot feels a bit simplistic in places—character development is particularly shallow here—I felt myself drawn into its curious setting and quirky atmosphere. The newly added voice acting is a great addition here, too, giving these characters a bit more dimension and making for much more interesting cutscenes.</p>
<p>Unlike its more well-known brethren, SMT and Persona, Raidou isn’t a turn-based RPG that sees you assembling demon parties to help you safely navigate dungeons. Instead, this is more of a detective story in which you spend your time tracking down leads, collecting clues, and honing your theories, interspersed with plenty of fights with hostile demons.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156935/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, the detective side of the gameplay loop can feel simplistic and fetch quest-y as you mostly just run from point A to point B to progress the plot, occasionally having to find a specific NPC or interact with something in the environment to keep things moving.</p>
<p>And though mechanics like the time management and Social Link systems from Persona would’ve felt out of place in a game with a much darker tone such as this, I couldn’t help but feel there was something missing with this detective work—it certainly feels like the most outdated aspect of the loop.</p>
<p>Things get far more interesting when you find yourself in a combat encounter, and it’s here where Atlus clearly did the most work to rehab the gameplay. Raidou’s headlining gimmick is that it’s SMT with action-packed hack-‘n’-slash combat, but the combat in the original release was pretty rough around the edges due to the fixed camera view and Raidou’s clunky movements. To address this, Atlus redesigned the battle system to borrow several elements from <strong>Raidou 2</strong>'s combat, resulting in something far more satisfying and interesting to play.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156947/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat encounters (which are no longer random) see Raidou dropped into a small arena with up to two partner demons to help him defeat foes locked in with him. These partner demons will each independently fight and use skills, which draw resources from a MAG (MP) shared pool. MAG is topped up primarily by Raidou, who can combo enemies with light attacks that replenish some MAG and heavy attacks that dish out a lot more damage. Raidou himself can also use cooldown magic skills to exploit elemental weaknesses and keep the team in fighting shape.</p>
<p>Though the Press Turn system doesn’t feature here, exploiting enemy weaknesses is still critically important. Not only will doing so place enemies into a brief stun state, but it’ll open them up to taking extra damage and doling out extra MAG the more you pummel them. Combat thus becomes a delicate and thrilling dance of mixing light and heavy attacks to best optimise your damage output and MAG reserves while strategically stunning and disabling different foes in the field.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed how dynamic this system is, as it somehow manages to stay simple while having a lot of depth that encourages player agency and expression. Swapping out demons to adjust to shifting battle conditions, dodge rolling away from attacks, and constantly switching between your various means of attacks leads to fights that are energetic, smooth, and tense in equal measure. In many ways, this feels like how I'd imagine Atlus’ take on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">DMC</a>-style character action game, and I hope that this isn’t the last time we see this combat system in a ‘new’ SMT-adjacent game.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156929/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you’re not in combat, character progression is primarily handled via various forms of the SMT series' famed Demon Fusion. After recruiting new demons from combat encounters and growing their stats and abilities a bit, you can initially fuse any two to make a more powerful one that retains characteristics of its predecessors. Not only does this keep your team feeling fresh as you constantly burn and add new demons to your repertoire, but it gives you a great feeling of progression as each new fusion makes Raidou that much more lethal on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Demon Fusion has also been reworked to make it simpler to search for potential fusions and easier to pass on skills and traits to new demons, sidestepping many of the more frustrating aspects of how this system worked originally. Plus, Atlus has retroactively added a few dozen new demons here from SMT releases that came after, giving you a lot more options as you work to fill out your compendium.</p>
<p>Demon Fusion has always been one of the most satisfying means of team-building in an RPG and I’m happy to report that Atlus hasn’t lost a step with its implementation here—it adds a lot to the replayability and makes the combat system even more interesting as you gain access to more demons to play around with.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155150/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a remaster, Raidou Remastered obviously has some much fancier visuals, but it’s also clear that this was a game initially released on PS2. The pre-rendered backgrounds are gone and have been replaced by much more vibrant 3D environments, but many scenes still stick to a fixed camera angle that can awkwardly change perspective with no warning. The character and demon models have been redone, but there’s also a stiffness to their movements and lifelessness in their eyes that betrays their origins on humbler hardware.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that Raidou looks bad; in fact, I would say it looks a decent bit <em>better</em> than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_iii_nocturne_hd_remaster">SMT 3</a> remaster Atlus did a few years ago. That buttery smooth 1080p 60fps gameplay looks great in motion, and the combat sequences especially look excellent. Even so, there’s only so much Atlus could do to jazz up a PS2 game without a complete overhaul on the level of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_3_reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, even though I put most of my time into the Switch 2 version, you can still pick this up on the base Switch if you wish. That version runs at an uncapped frame rate that typically hovers around 30fps, while the image quality will drop to the Switch 1 screen's resolution of 720p in handheld mode. Aside from the longer load times, it’s otherwise the exact same game and it feels like a solid port that fits well on the Switch hardware, though the Switch 2 version is obviously the superior pick if you want the best possible experience.)</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156954/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding its music, Raidou Remastered pulls equally from both Persona and SMT with its mixture of bouncy jazz for most environments and heavy rock for the combat. Overall, there’s quite a lot of depth here and I enjoyed how it manages to simultaneously feel like an OST that’s unmistakably descended from SMT while still managing to carve out its own identity.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic, smartly polishing up its best parts and modifying its worst parts to make for an overall more enjoyable experience. Though the visuals are just 'okay' and the detective gameplay can be a bit plain, the action-packed combat, reworked demon fusion, and interesting story all come together to make for a gripping adventure.</p>
<p>I’d recommend you pick this one up if you’re curious and you think it may be up your alley. I’ve never played anything quite like Raidou, and it offers a very unique take not just on the standard SMT formula, but action RPGs on the whole.</p></section>

<p>Sculpt and paint using mouse mode</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct shed a load of light on the upcoming platformer, and one of the coolest new additions is undoubtedly <strong>DK Artist</strong>.</p>
<p>Channeling some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> energy (in which you could mess around with a 3D model of Mario in the title screen), this mode lets you paint and distort sculptures to your heart's desire, and includes familiar characters like Mario and Bowser. Using the Switch 2's mouse capabilities, you can paint directly onto your sculpture, chip away at it, or even add new elements entirely.</p>
<p>You can change the lighting or add some rad banana effects to make your designs shine even more. Honestly, it looks really cool, and it's the sort of thing we could see ourselves losing hours of time too; particularly if more base designs get added as DLC later down the road.</p>
<figure><a title="DK Artist 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4ba7631179c60/dk-artist-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Direct also revealed that Pauline will play a critical role in Donkey Kong Bananza, with co-op multiplayer allowing an extra player to use her remarkable singing prowess to attack enemies and chip away at the environment.</p>

			<p><span>A Data Link Between Worlds. That’s what I went away with after my brief 30-minute hands-on session with Bandai Namco’s upcoming monster-taming JRPG, Digimon Story: Time Stranger. Despite only dabbling with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review/">Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</a> on the PlayStation Vita, Bandai Namco assured me that Time Stranger would be just as standalone as other titles in the franchise.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The art and character designs were among the first things I picked up when diving into Digimon Story: Time Stranger. With Suzuhito Yasuda returning as the character designer, the animated portraits and character profiles look like the highest definition versions of some of his previous works with Bandai Namco. The character models stand out among the muted colors of the digital realm, giving this JRPG a distinctive charm. Symbol encounters make their debut, with enemy Digimon being visible on the field to help pick and choose your fights rather than being at the mercy of random encounters.</span></p>
<p><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger’s narrative focuses on the twin worlds of real-world Japan (Shinjuku and Akihabara, primarily) and the digital realm that the Digimon call their home, some eight years in the past. While my brief demo only focused on the latter, Bandai Namco hinted that it would be possible to go back and forth between the two as the story progresses. Whether there are be any time hijinx and events taking place in the past cascading into the future, and vice versa, is a mystery they’d like to leave until release. One of Digimon Story: Time Stranger's recent story trailers centered around a citywide explosion at the beginning of the story, leading to the player getting transported into the digital realm, so surely there must be something worth going back to.</span></p>

<p><span>Each Digimon offshoot brings a different gameplay style altogether. Those who played the most recent Digimon Survive would remember that entry for its visual novel storytelling and strategic grid-based battles. Here, Digimon Story: Time Stranger takes after the earlier Digimon Story titles with your typical party- and turn-based encounters. With players bringing in four Digimon at a time in addition to guest characters, there’s a lot to juggle in combat, but thankfully, the Digimon themselves are streamlined, at least in one way. Digimon have a few available skills to pick from, at least in the introductory hours of the game. Most are inline with attacking with the given element of that particular monster, while others come with buffing and debuffing skills to turn the tide of battle. Digimon can also use an item before taking action, freeing up a command that might otherwise be spent recovering health after a vicious boss attack.</span></p>
<p><span>With nearly a dozen different elements and seven attributes (Bandai Namco only showed off Data, Vaccine, and Virus, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Free and perhaps Variable making a return), there are a lot of variables to consider when testing an attack's effectiveness. Enemy affinities remain a mystery until attacked with a particular element, upon which it shows off whether the attack is only partially effective or upwards of 250-300% effective, depending on if you’re targeting both the enemy’s weakest element and attributes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With over 450 digital monsters in the roster, there’s going to be plenty for new and returning players to discover for the first time. Part of the charm of Digimon is its non-linear evolution chains, so two players can play through Digimon Story: Time Stranger and come out with vastly different party compositions.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the titles at SGF I was most excited to check out was <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger.</em> Having loved the previous two <em>Digimon Story</em> games I was excited to see a new location, new story, but more of the same JRPG goodness.</p>

<p>I got to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger,</em> starting with the protagonist, Aegiomon, and Inori first reaching Central Town in the Digital World. After a brief cutscene of the characters making their way through a sewer to a ladder, the party emerges in Central Town.</p>

<h2>Central Town Is Alive With Digimon</h2>

<p>I was blown away by just how much was going on in this city. From where you emerge, you can see at least three dozen digimon, of levels from Baby up to Mega, some hanging around having conversations, some watching over the city, and others working as store owners or guides.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene.jpg?itok=19gvX6HX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene.jpg?itok=X8WxfCGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How many can you count? Astamon is serving drinks at the bar for Xros Wars fans</figcaption></figure><p>It was a feast to the eyes, and as a fan of Digimon, I was even more excited to hear that every Digimon that I could see in and around Central Town was one I could obtain for myself through scanning or digivolution.</p>

<p>With a variety of colorful characters, different themed Digimon exploring relevant environments, and active movement, it really made the city feel alive.</p>

<p>Exploring the city, there was a shop to purchase stat-changing equipment from, attacks to purchase for your Digimon, and food for the Digifarm. Plenty for you to spend your hard-earned cash on. I didn't get to dig much more into that, but a lot of it was the standard RPG array of items and elemental attacks of varying power.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Overworld Combat And QOL</h2>

<p>Leaving Central Town on a Pegasusmon's back, it was my new goal to reach the top of a large tower. Entering a space with aggressive Digimon, there were a few things that I was shown.</p>

<p>The first was that there were a variety of supplies and crates that I could destroy with my Digimon to obtain the item.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=9m6HNF5S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=a7j_dO8I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Defeat weak Digimon instantly while reaping the benefits</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon now spawn in the overworld, as opposed to being random encounters. On top of that, I was surprised when I initiated my first battle… and it was over just as soon as it had started. A new Quality of Life feature in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is that if you're up against Digimon that are less powerful than your own party by a certain amount, you'll win automatically.</p>

<p>What's even better about this is that not only is EXP still earned, but you get scan data for the Digimon you face too.</p>

<p>When you encounter a Digimon that you don't kill immediately, you'll get launched into turn-based combat. Here you can perform basic attacks or lean into your Digimon's special abilities. This is where I experienced the least difference from prior <em>Digimon Story</em> games, but also it's Shin Megami Tensei style combat, where there's a focus on using special attacks and swapping between a variety of unique creatures. It doesn't need to totally reinvent the genre to be a good combat system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=vaRjZlXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=6oaGvcod 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another major Quality of Life improvement is that combat speed can change. You can have 1x, 2x, 3x, and 5x battle speed. When you know your Digimon, what combos of abilities are strongest, and are maybe doing some experience farming this speed up will be a saving grace.</p>

<h2>Boss Battles Have Evolving Moments</h2>

<p>There were two places where combat showed off some unique aspects that I experienced as I was fighting against Parrotmon, a boss/titan at this point in the story.</p>

<p>The first of these changes involved Parrotmon directly. Partway through the battle, Parrotmon brought its wings in towards its body, protecting itself as it started to charge up electrical energy with its head. A new white bar appeared below its health; this was a gauge that I needed to take down by specifically attacking its head instead of its body, otherwise it would unleash a powerful attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=OzSdi9MQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=G7-f9kuH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This added dynamic element created a reason to prioritize powerful attacks, turning the battle momentarily into a sprint as opposed to being a marathon.</p>

<p>The other change is how the tamer is involved in a battle. The first of which is in item usage. Instead of an Item being used, and taking up a Digimon's turn, the Tamer has their own 'action' that they can take. If an item is used, the Digimon whose turn it is is still able to perform an ability, but it will take a rotation of all of the Digimon before your Tamer can use an action again.</p>

<p>This came in clutch while I was using Tankmon in the battle against Parrotmon. Tankmon has a powerful attack that will leave him paralyzed for a turn. Just before it was Tankmon's turn, I was about to use a restorative item with the Tamer, readying Tankmon for another powerful attack, while still getting to deal heavy damage with a Kyuubimon.</p>

<p>A second way that the Tamer is involved is with a powerful X-Art (Pronounced Cross Art). While battling, you'll earn points by hitting your enemy with type advantage attacks, and avoiding being hit with moves that are strong against your Digimon. Activating this ability stacked three turns' worth of every buff on my entire party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=N50H5BSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=DnaQ9qzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>X-Arts will subtly let you know when it's ready to be activated</figcaption></figure><p>This was another time, this time created by the player, to set up your most powerful Digimon to attack in quick succession to capitalize on the boosts that you receive.</p>

<p>One thing that wasn't clear about X-Art is whether this kind of ability is one that can be swapped out, or you can expand from having one option to multiple.</p>

<h2>Creating And Digivolving Your Partners</h2>

<p>Digimon are at the core of this experience. At any time in your party, you can have three active members and three reserve members. There are also spaces for guest party members who are part of combat, but can't be controlled by the player. You can also have 999 additional Digimon in your storage. You can freely transfer Digimon in and out of your party whether you're in a city or out in areas where you can fight wild Digimon. I got to see Aegiomon and Minervamon as guests in this session.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=a64pZFBe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=Pwy5sSkM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In combat as you attack a Digimon their weaknesses and resistances will slowly be revealed</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon in your party, whether they're active or in reserve, will all gain full experience in battle, which is a lovely touch.</p>

<p>Encountering Digimon in the wild, you'll scan them. Once you've scanned them to 100%, you can convert that data into a Digimon of that type for yourself. Additionall,y you can scan to 200% and the Digimon that you create will have boosted stats as well as a higher maximum level potential.</p>

<p>An aspect of Digimon raising that I didn't get to see as part of the gameplay demo was the Digimon farm so we'll have to look for more than that in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Digimon Has Never Looked So Good</h2>

<p>Walking around the world, seeing Digimon interact with one another, and most frequently during the battle scene, was just how good the Digimon in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> looked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=O0IR81zm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=GfTBjksC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was most impressed with seeing Zudomon up close, his bulkier model looking really well-defined in Central Town, and Kyuubimon in the middle of battle. The boss battle took place under dark cloud cover, but Kyuubimon's flaming elements glowed bright. This not only looked more realistic, but also made me think of other interesting fire or water elements of different Digimon and how they'll be represented.</p>

<h2>References Everywhere</h2>

<p>You can tell that the developers are fans of the source material by how even that small slice of the world was overflowing with references. The Digimon 02 Rookies could be found near the Trailmon station, Tamers Rookies were hanging out in an alleyway, and even Arukenimon and Mummymon were seen together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=icktb10K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=QxT2s_Le 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the middle of a conversation you might notice the cast of Digimon Adventure 02 in the distance</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the specific references to groups of Digimon, if there's a Digimon that you're a fan of from specific Digimon media ,then chances are that Digimon is here. We've seen Digimon as early as <em>Digimon Adventure</em>, all the way up to <em>Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't entirely clear if we'll see any Digimon from <em>Ghost Game</em> or characters like Pulsemon or Herrismon from mobile games, and I think it would be safe to assume we won't see any <em>Appmon</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I went into <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> as a lifelong Digimon fan, and someone who has been poring over released footage and assets, and I was still blown away by what I got to see. The world is full and thriving with Digimon life. Packed full of new Digimon (like Tankdramon) and references that Digimon fans will always smile to see.</p>

<p>I hope they are hiding some <em>Ghost Game</em> Digimon, and that we'll get to see more of the Armor Digivolutions (including some non-canonical ones).</p>

<p>The release of this game can't come any sooner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-creates-gaming-divisions-for-top-ip-including-mortal-kombat-and-harry-potter.1221906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-restructure-divisions-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Games has announced that it will restructure itself into divisions based around its four main IPs, with three studio heads already appointed to oversee the new divisions.</p>

<p>According to a Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the four divisions will be based around the key WB properties, namely&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, the&nbsp;DC universe, and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>. The three new studio heads will all report directly to WB gaming head J.B. Perrette.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've identified a number discrepancy in this announcement, you're not wrong, but there's a simple explanation. Both&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;</i>will be overseen by a single studio head, namely WB Montreal head Yves Lachance. NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick will be&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>and DC's steward, while WB New York's Steven Flenory will work on the publishing and tech side of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=OhBHeGSf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=axEdBZ40 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. has reorganized its gaming department into four key divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Variety, no employees have been laid off as part of this change, which comes as a pleasant surprise after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">spate</a> of "structural realignment" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">operations</a> we've seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">recent months</a> (and over the last couple of years, as a matter of fact).</p>

<p>The change also comes after former Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a> a few months ago. His departure follows a couple of rather embarrassingly high-profile failures for the company's gaming segment, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">flop fighting game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">MultiVersus</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">large-scale letdown&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>.</p>

<p>As Variety notes, it's not clear whether this change is intended to be a permanent replacement for Haddad's leadership or whether it's a stopgap while the company tries to find a successor for him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=FSCfp-pd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=DA6P0PYb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>was one of two major letdowns for Warner Bros. last year.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might have guessed, these failures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">led to a "disappointing" financial year</a> for Warner Bros., which is likely why the company has chosen to reorganize around its key franchises (although it should be pointed out that both of its major flops last year were based, at least in part, on some of those franchises).</p>

<p>The studio's poor performance could well also have been a factor in the closure of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith</a> earlier this year, along with&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First Games and regional division WB San Diego.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this means for Warner Bros.' gaming operations in the long run. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Switch 2 owners will soon have another big Nintendo game to play. During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687451/nintendo-direct-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay">its latest Direct presentation</a>, the company showed off plenty more of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">a 3D platformer that launches as a Switch 2 exclusive on July 17th</a> — and it’s looking like a surprisingly robust experience.</p></div><p>In the new game DK teams up with a younger version of the singer Pauline — who apparently has been hidden inside of a rock for some time — and travels to an underground realm that seems kind of like Nintendo’s take on Hollow Earth. Despite being below ground, the game takes place in a varied and diverse world, with beaches, mountains, and icy locales. There are even giant elder characters and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-style ancient ruins with unique challenges.</p><p>The Direct was primarily focused on gameplay, which in <em>Bananza</em> is built around destruction. DK can smash up the environment, tear of chunks of terrain to use as a weapon, and also, uh, turn into a number of different animals. The game’s “banana transformations” let DK transform into creatures like an ostrich (so he can fly) or a zebra (so he can run so fast he can even sprint on water). These powers utilize a substance called “bananergy.” There are also other abilities that can be unlocked through a skill tree. Maybe the most important: you can purchase new outfits for both DK and Pauline. So even though it mostly plays like a platformer, it appears that <em>Bananza</em> has significant role-playing elements.</p><p>There’s a two-player co-op mode where one person controls Pauline, and the multiplayer supports GameShare, so you can play on two different consoles using only one copy of the game. <em>Bananza</em> also has a bonus mode where you can sculpt rocks using the Switch 2’s new mouse controls.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> was first revealed during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s big Switch 2 unveiling in April</a>. It’s the second major first-party release for the console, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which launched alongside the new console. <em>Bananza</em> is the franchise’s first 3D platformer since the Nintendo 64 era, and is the first mainline entry since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Tropical Freeze</a></em> more than a decade ago.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros. Games have enacted some corporate-mandated chair-rejigging after shuttering three studios earlier this year. The company are now divided into four divisions that'll be focusing on the four game series they want to do stuff with.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">Variety</a>, these four bits will focus on making games about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, Mortal Kombat, the DC Universe, and the wizard that I'm not going to bother naming.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Warner Bros Games Montréal head Yves Lachance has been tapped to oversee the making of Game of Thrones and unnamed wizard games as a senior vice president, while NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick is getting a similar promotion to look after games involving a bit of Mortal Kombat or DC superheroes.</p>
<p>This rejigging, Warner Bros exec JB Perrette says, is all about "optimising our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps", which is definitely some words. It follows Warner Bros. Games shutting down Monolith, Player First Games, and Warner Bros Games San Diego <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">back in February</a>, resulting in an unspecified number of job losses.</p>
<p>At that time, Warner Bros. indicated that this circling of the wagons around what they'd identified as their four golden geese was its plan going forwards, following a big live-service push that hadn't delivered the sorts of returns games industry execs look for in that sort of thing. Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League ended up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">the poster child</a> of the company's ill-fated efforts to go in that direction, which were followed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">departing</a> at the start of this year.</p>
<p>At the time it was closed, Monolith - developers of games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-one-lives-forever">No One Lives Forever</a>, F.E.A.R, and the Nemesis system having  - had been working on a Wonder Woman game which had reportedly suffered a troubled development and was cancelled alongside the studio shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Player First Games' Multiversus <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/">shut its online doors</a> last month, and you can on longer buy it on the few storefronts that it hasn't been totally erased from as part of that process.</p>
<p>Going forwards, Warner Bros. Games have already committed to making a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/">wizard game sequel</a>, and debuted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-reveal-game-of-thrones-rts-starring-the-lannisters-starks-targaryens-and-night-king">Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</a> at the Keighleyfest just gone. They'll be the first of what WB execs will hope resembles a wave of hits to get out of some rough financial waters. It was also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report">hinted earlier this year</a> that letting Rocksteady go back to single-player was a thing that could happen, which would in theory be a shred of good news amid all the bad that's come of WB's strategy over the past few years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether that pans out remains to be seen, but given that <em>Digimon</em>, arguably the most notable competition <em>Pokémon </em>had in the 90s and early 2000s, has been quietly running circles around Pikachu and friends on the video game side for years, I’m not holding my breath. I played about half an hour of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and though my time with the RPG was brief, it was a succinct reminder that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-con-2025-story-card-game-app-alysion-new-anime-1851771263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-con-2025-story-card-game-app-alysion-new-anime-1851771263"><em>Digimon </em>has been cooking up some excellent, polished RPGs</a></span> in its own lane. The last mainline <em>Story </em>game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607"><em>Cyber Sleuth</em></a></span>, was a hidden gem of 2016, so I’m hopeful <em>Time Stranger </em>breaks through the noise when it launches later this year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,196790,196411" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’ve ever played <em>Digimon </em>or watched the anime, you know the general conceit of the franchise. The titular critters live in a digital world that humans are able to enter via virtual reality. <em>Time Stranger </em>focuses on a different “server” than the one where previous <em>Story </em>games took place and is set in the digital world of Iliad, managed by a powerful pantheon of Digimon called the Olympos XII. </p><p>As a longtime <em>Digimon </em>fan, I’ve always been drawn to how the games riff on the lore by finding new ways to implement old characters and mythological figures into new iterations of the Digital World, and <em>Time Stranger </em>already has me intrigued. Recent <em>Story </em>games were set in a somewhat barren cyberspace world that was aesthetically compelling in a minimalist way, but weren’t that stimulating to walk around in. <em>Time Stranger</em>’s shift to Iliad not only opens up the visual identity of these games to include lush environments and lively towns filled with Digimon living in harmony; it’s also paving the way for new stories with different major players. <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>was a sort of <em>Avengers </em>moment for some of the series’ mainstays, so <em>Time Stranger</em> putting the focus on the Olympos XII for the first time in several years is an exciting prospect.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-recommend-id="image://ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-recommend-id="image://ebad4016c5f9d6253b359155b66cab3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player walking through a crowded bar of Digimon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the short time I was able to spend in Iliad’s Central Town hub, I was excited to explore and meet all the Digimon living there as civilians, unbothered by the petty squabbles of humanity in the real world. There’s so much character to this little town that even as the game pans over it in a cutscene, so many lively details catch your eye. Little touches like seeing Zudomon using its hammer to pound away on an anvil as a blacksmith and Etemon hanging off the signage on the buildings make the town feel lived in, and nearly every inch of the town is covered in Digimon interacting with the world and each other like this.</p><p>I didn’t plan to spend most of my time playing <em>Time Stranger </em>comparing it to <em>Pokemon</em>, but the stark difference between it and Game Freak’s RPGs is top of mind for me right now after playing a bit of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>on Switch 2. Yeah, the games finally run at a smooth 60 frames-per-second, but the world still looks and feels like a GameCube-era tech demo, whereas <em>Time Stranger</em>, and <em>Digimon </em>games more broadly, feel like childhood dreams realized. They take risks, change up the formula constantly, and most importantly, they feel like fully realized worlds visually, narratively, and systemically. Whether it’s been in the <em>Story </em>series, the <em>World</em> games, or more off-the-wall spin-offs like the the visual novel tactics RPG <em>Digimon Survive</em>, this franchise has never stopped swinging for the fences, even after it was deemed the “loser” of the ‘90s and ‘00s monster tamer race. Maybe that’s what happens when you still feel like you’ve got something to prove and can’t rest on your guaranteed millions of sales. There’s some freedom in not being beholden to the same machine your rival is, and it makes for more interesting games.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-recommend-id="image://6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-recommend-id="image://6fe0a657b735a9a16c7d8fd662ce453c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle between the protagonist and Parrotmon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While exploration is much more of a priority this time around, <em>Time Stranger</em> is still focused on the monster taming aspect above all else. With more than 450 Digimon available to you, there’s a lot of room for experimentation in what might look, at a glance, like a pretty straightforward turn-based battle system. <em>Time Stranger</em> still utilizes the rock-paper-scissors structure <em>Digimon </em>always has, but it also has a <em>Final Fantasy X</em>-style swapping system that lets you adjust your strategies on the fly by switching between your active party and your benched teammates without penalty. Some of the battles I took part in were your standard random fight affair, but the boss fight against a super-powered Parrotmon really showed the potential of its turn-based battles. This clash felt more like a raid battle that required a lot more setup with support abilities, pushing me to prioritize defense rather than just bulldozing through with my most powerful attacks, and demonstrating that <em>Time Stranger</em> could be more dynamic than its predecessors.</p><p><em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s story and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773"><em>Persona</em>-esque</a></span> vibe were the draw above all else, with some critics arguing that the battle system was generic and uninvolving. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-the-kotaku-review-1760797607"><em>Kotaku</em>’s Mike Fahey</a></span> called them“a mindless chore.”) <em>Time Stranger</em>, by contrast, is certainly not reaching the elaborate, systems-heavy turn-based play of something like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span>, but what I played of it suggests developer Media.Vision is taking that criticism to heart, and I”m interested to see just how far it can take these systems when the game launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game's standard edition is $70, which is $10 more than what Borderlands 3 cost at launch, and that makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford quite happy. He said on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935048930955563192" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> that he is "so stoked" that publisher 2K decided to not raise the price to $80.</p><p>Some had theorized that Borderlands 4 would follow Mario Kart World in being priced at $80. Microsoft has plans to charge $80 for games as well, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2 later this year. 2K, however, isn't taking a one-size approach to all of its games, as Mafia: The Old Country will be $50 at launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Launch Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Pitchford added that he is similarly excited that "we're not doing any paid early access stuff" and that the team moved the game's release date up to September 12. Many modern games unlock early for people who pay extra, but Borderlands 4 isn't taking that approach. As for the release date, Borderlands 4 was originally set to debut on September 23 before moving ahead a few weeks.</p><p>What's more, Pitchford said he's happy that Gearbox is planning lots of post-launch DLC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">new Vault Hunters coming after launch for a fee.</a></p><p>While Borderlands 4's standard edition is $70, Gearbox is offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">$100, $130, and $150 editions of the game</a> for people who want to pay extra to get more stuff. For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">Borderlands 4 preorder guide.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">more than double the development budget of Borderlands 3</a>, and as mentioned earlier, the game's standard edition costs $10 more than Borderlands 3 did at launch in 2019. With revenue from Borderlands 4's premium edition and DLC sales factored in, the average selling cost of Borderlands 4 at launch may indeed be higher than $70, but final numbers may never be released.</p><p>The Borderlands franchise has sold nearly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">93 million copies to date</a>, and Borderlands 3 was 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. It's sold more than 22 million copies, but Borderlands 2 remains the best-selling entry in the series to date with more than 30 million copies sold.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later.</p>

<p>Oddrock is out and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/say-hello-to-pauline-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline is in</a> (who could have seen that coming?), and you can bring a friend along to play as her. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s co-op options, Bananza will let you sling a remote to somebody else, letting them fire off attacks and pick up collectibles — of which there appear to be <em>hundreds</em> — while you get to all the DK action.</p>
<p>Pauline's vocal blasts can be controlled by the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, to give your aiming some much-needed precision.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, you read that headline correctly. Bananza will support GameShare so you can play with a pal on another system, <em>even</em> if that other system is a Switch 1! Of course, this will only work in Local GameShare (you'll have to both have a Switch 2 if you want to do it online), but it's a cool feature nonetheless. Talk about sharing the love, eh?</p>

<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, Pauline is a talented singer who wants to reach the Planet's Core to make her dreams come true.</p>
<p>Her singing voice is an important part of the game, and not just the story, as Pauline can use it to unseal certain items, as well as help guide players to their next location. You can also dress her up, too, which is absolutely adorable.</p>

<p>Pauline's appearance in the game was leaked back in April 2025 thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">key art shared on the official Nintendo Korea website</a>. It was taken down soon after, but if you saw it, the surprise was spoiled.</p>

You can watch the entire 15-minute video below.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,196055,196766" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While we already knew that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was going to be a 3D open-world action adventure starring Mario’s first-ever enemy and that nearly everything in every level is destructible, it was hard to get a sense of exactly how the game would play. After fifteen minutes in its company, that feels completely different. This looks like it could be very special. (Jump to 29:30.)</p><p>DK is accompanied on Ingot Isle by Pauline, who, it seems, was trapped inside that purple rock we saw in earlier glimpses of <em>Bananza</em>? Who knows. But the important thing is, the two of them are then free to smash their way around layer after layer of adventure, each level set below the last, until you reach the core of the planet.</p><p>As the video goes on, we learn that DK can pretty much go anywhere at any point, climbing anything, and then also smash through or down any part of the level. It seems you really can bash down just about anything, which will&nbsp;hopefully lead to some excellent videos as people attempt to destroy entire levels. Oh, and he can turn into a zebra and an ostrich?! Amazing. He’s doing all this with the goal of finding Banandium, a precious banana-shaped gem, while also trying to help Pauline return to her non-ape-based reality.</p><p>As <em>Kotaku</em> watched the video, one by one we all declared our astonishment at how much is going on in this game, and how much we want to be playing it. However, like everyone else, we’re going to have to wait a month. The game is out on July 17, with pre-orders open now. Remember, this is a Switch 2 exclusive, and there’s no version for the original Switch. Presumably this was once intended to be a launch title, but needed an extra couple of months.</p><p>This really does look like the big title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">the Switch 2 is desperately lacking</a></span>. This definitely doesn’t look like it’s some sort of stop-gap before the proper <em>Super Mario</em> title, but rather a full-fledged&nbsp;<em>Super Donkey Kong</em> action game to occupy our summer. You know, if it plays as good as it looks. We’ll find out soon.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
