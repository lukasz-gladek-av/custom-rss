			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally here, and to help you put your best foot forward when jumping into multiplayer matches, I've put together a guide for the best weapons and loadouts for each of its classic four classes.</p>



<p>Of course, not every weapon and variant in this guide will be available to you the moment you load up the game; you'll have to grind some levels for them, but they still work well as loadouts to work towards well before you reach the level cap.</p>



<p>Also, since this guide is meant to focus on early loadouts, when it comes to secondary weapons for each loadout, the only option until you at least reach level 24 will be the P18 pistol. It's not bad, but the actual next-best option is arguably the M45A1, and you won't get that until you reach level 39. So that's why each loadout will feature the P18 for now.</p>



<p>A final note, this guide will stick with weapons that are the signature category of weapons for each class. Of course, you're free to mix and match, but this guide is for anyone wanting to stick within that class's signature traits.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class">Battlefield 6 Guide - Best Early Weapons and Loadouts for Each Class</h2>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Assault loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For Assault players, you'll start out having to use the M433 assault rifle, which honestly isn't a bad place to start. The same goes for the introductory carbine, the M4A1. Both weapons are better for close-range encounters than what I actually recommend for this class, but Battlefield isn't just about fighting in tight corridors. That's why my actual recommendation is the B36A4 assault rifle. It has a lower rate of fire but is better for mid to long-range engagements, and packs just as much of a damage punch.</p>



<p>To make it even better for longer ranges, adding the 2.00x sight will help you see across the larger maps like Liberation Peak and Mirak Valley.</p>



<p>If you want an alternative for closer-range encounters while playing Assault, then stick with the M433, but adding a side 1.00 sight to the B36A4 once you've reached Mastery 6 can help make it more usable in close encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you'll want to take advantage of the Assault classes trait that lets you add a second primary weapon to your loadout. This is where you'll equip the M87A1 shotgun. It's the first shotgun available to you in the game, and having it in one of your gadget slots (whichever is easier for you to swap to on your button layout) is arguably far better than swapping to the P18 if you're running out of ammo in an encounter. Yes, it's really only great for mid to close range encounters, but you'll do more damage per shot than taking the time to reload your assault rifle. </p>



<p>Your other gadget should be set to the M320A1 high-explosive launcher, and for a better ease of use, mounting it to your assault rifle makes swapping to it much faster.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Assault loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: B36A4 Assault Rifle (2.00 sight, mounted launcher)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: M87A1 Shotgun</li>



<li>Gadget 2: M320A1 High Explosive Launcher</li>



<li>Throwable: Frag Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Engineer loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Engineers are arguably one of the most versatile and important classes in Battlefield 6, because they can be a direct response in large-scale battles like Conquest and Breakthrough, and are extremely useful in close-range battles with SMGs as their signature weapons.</p>



<p>The SGX is honestly a really great starting weapon for this class, but you'll want to work your way to the PW5A3 SMG, specifically its Warfighter variant, for a faster reload speed that can make or break close-quarters fights. The PW5A3 is also more versatile for mid-range battles, and since you'll want to be using the Engineer class to take out tanks and other vehicles in those large-scale fights, having a bit more range on your weapon doesn't hurt.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you start out with the MBT-LAW auto-guided launcher, which is by no means a slouch. It's great for doing solid damage to vehicles, particularly tanks, but the time you'll need to ensure you're locked on to a tank can sometimes be what gets you killed before firing. That's why you'll want to work your way up to the RPG-7V2 for a much more versatile and all-around launcher that can do solid damage to vehicles, and blow holes out the side of a building if you need to deal with some enemies behind cover.</p>



<p>Your second gadget can stay as the AV mine, or anti-vehicle mine. It's a great defensive tactic when playing defence on modes like Breakthrough, and deals heavy damage to tanks and ground vehicles.</p>



<p>Here's  a full breakdown of what your Engineer loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: PW5A3 (Warfighter variant, Fast Mag, Double-Port Brake Muzzle, Extended Barrel, Red Laser)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: RPG-7V2</li>



<li>Gadget 2: AV Mine</li>



<li>Throwable: Anti-Vehicle Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Support loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how Engineers are vital to dealing with vehicles, the Support class is vital for keeping your squad alive. Battlefield 6, like other Battlefield games before it, is at its best when you're working together with your squad.</p>



<p>That's why, before we even get to your primary weapon, one of your gadgets that should just be permanently equipped is the Defibrillator. It can damage other players, and revives your own teammates much faster than any other class. Regarding your second gadget, I recommend the GPDIS, the grenade intercept system, since it can be a better deterrent for keeping your squadmates alive under heavy fire than deployable cover.</p>



<p>Onto your primary weapon, you'll want to work towards the RPKM LMG (Carnivore variant). You'll start out with the L110, which again, isn't bad, but LMGs like it take far too long to reload for my tastes. Even though you won't have a sprinting or aiming down-sight penalty when using them with the Support class, the RPKM is the way to go in your early hours because it does more damage and is much faster to reload, making it a more versatile choice.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Support loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: RPKM LMG (Carnivore Variant)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Defibrillator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: GPDIS</li>



<li>Throwable: Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Sledgehammer </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Recon loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the Recon class. For Battlefield 6 players who want to remain on the edges of the fight and take out unsuspecting enemies from range, there are two ways you can approach this class. Either stick with a sniper rifle, though your only option then is M2010 ESR, or swap that for a DRM to fire off shots faster while still being able to see far down range with a stronger scope.</p>



<p>Now, since I said at the top of this guide that I'll be sticking with signature weapons, what I'll recommend here is the M2010 ESR, but I just wanted to note that going with a DRM can make your Recon loadout better suited for smaller-scale battles, if you wanted to go that route.</p>



<p>Regarding the M2010 ESR, it's not going to be the best when you first jump in with it, but what can make all the difference with this sniper rifle are the attachments. For example, if you're setting up in a singular spot to pick off headshots, then equipping the Bipod for your underbarrel attachment helps to keep your aim smooth. If you're going to be picking up and moving, then having the full-angled underbarrel attachment decreases your ADS time and keeps you more mobile.</p>



<p>For your gadgets, you'll want to have your Laser Designator equipped so you can help pick out vehicles and tanks for Engineers and other vehicles to lock onto. You can also pick out locations for players to focus on. Overall, it helps you and your squad see the battlefield better, which is what makes it the preferred choice.</p>



<p>Your second gadget should be the Recon Drone, since it once again helps you and your squad see the battlefield better and spot enemies for you, with the added bonus that you can use it on offence, taking out enemy gadgets through walls.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Recon loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: M2010 ESR Sniper Rifle (Bipod/Full Angled underbarrel, 6.00 scope, Range Finder right accessory)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Laser Designator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: Recon Drone</li>



<li>Throwable: Proximity Detector</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Obviously, your mileage may vary with each of these loadouts, since everyone will have their own preferences. But these are all great options for what's available to you early on in the game, well before you move through the level cap and all the challenges that are required to unlock the full arsenal. </p>



<p>I'll also put together a refreshed version of this guide when we're deeper into the game and looking at a wider range of what's available, but for now, aiming for these loadouts will help you dominate each match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MachineGames posted a new 15th anniversary picture and, in it, showcases a new yet-to-be-announced game.</p>



<p>For 15 years, MachineGames has been crafting some of the best action FPS on the market. From the Nazi-killing bloodbath of Wolfenstein to the historic adventures of Indiana Jones, the team are masters of the craft. With last year’s release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-hands-on-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, fans have been waiting to see what’s next from the studio. Fortunately, we now know it is working on something new, thanks to a new celebratory post.</p>



<h2 id="h-machinegames-15th-anniversary-poster-shows-mysterious-next-game">MachineGames’ 15th Anniversary Poster Shows Mysterious Next Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1976685867235164308?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, MachineGames revealed a poster celebrating the studio’s 15th anniversary. All of the newest titles, like Wolfenstein: The New Order and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, are there. However, next to Indy is a blocked off box with a question mark. Seeing as Great Circle was the most recent, it seems MachinesGames is hinting it’s currently working on the studio’s next new title. Furthermore, as it’s on the 15th anniversary poster, we could find out what it is before the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for what the next game could be, it’s likely it’ll be either a new Wolfenstein or Indiana Jones. For Wolfenstein, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-new-wolfenstein-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest</a> in returning to the series in a recent documentary. With Indiana Jones, the massive success and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from Disney</a> may have the team invigorated to pick up his whip sooner than later. Still, it could be an entirely new project or IP, seeing as MachineGames has been doing franchise titles for a bit. Either way, it’s clear the studio is almost ready to share it’s next title and, if it’s anything like the others, it’s one to watch out for.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see what MachineGames’ new title is? What do you hope the new game will be? Wolfenstein? Indiana Jones? Something new for its anniversary?

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/amd-and-sony-tease-new-chip-architecture-ahead-of-playstation-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-and-sony%E2%80%99s-ps6-chipset-aims-to-rethink-the-current-graphics-pipeline.1322146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor"</a> and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD's FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony's similar PSSR system</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the same source. Two branches. One vision.</p>
<p>My good friend and fellow gamer <a href="https://twitter.com/cerny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cerny</a> and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.</p>
<p>Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/De9HWV3Ub2">pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2</a></p>
<p>— Jack Huynh (@JackMHuynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.</p>
<p>To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Discord began testing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discords-new-age-verification-requires-id-or-face-scans-for-some-users/1100-6530915/" data-ref-id="1100-6530915">a new age-verification process</a> in the United Kingdom that required users to scan their government-issued ID. That has come back to haunt both Discord and the users who shared that info, as a new report suggests that millions of people may have had their ID and other info exposed during a recent data hack.</p><p>According to a statement <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Discord's official site</a>, the government-issued ID of 70,000 users may have been exposed when a third-party service provider, 5CA, was hacked.

Discord has stated that full credit card numbers and CCV codes weren't included in the breach, and added that it is working with law enforcement while notifying affected users by email.</p><p>The ID photographs of the affected users could also be leaked, which was one of the reasons the UK faced pushback over this requirement. 5CA appears to have been responsible for manual reviews for users whose IDs were initially rejected or people who were appealing age-related suspensions.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo attempted to subpoena Discord to discover the identity of a user responsible for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-trying-to-subpoena-discord-over-massive-pokemon-leak/1100-6531036/" data-ref-id="1100-6531036">a massive Pokemon leak</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> is out today and it’s already blowing up on Steam. The multiplayer military shooter is already well on its way to a million concurrents on Steam alone as fans race to witness the franchise’s revival after years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">stumbles and collective disappointment</a>. The record-breaking influx initially meant long queues but now some players are facing others issues, including a weird bug that tells them they need to buy and download a multiplayer mode they already own to start playing.</p> <p>Currently in the top-five most played games on Steam, <em>Battlefield</em> is the only game in the top four that’s paid. A $70 price tag hasn’t stopped it from overtaking Valve’s<em> Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, or the perennial chart-topping battle royale<em> PUBG</em>. Players logging on when the game went live around 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday were immediately greeted by absurd queue positions featuring hundreds of thousands of other players trying to get into the always-online game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">350,000 in the queue for Battlefield 6 already 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/O6tPcS7e7R">pic.twitter.com/O6tPcS7e7R</a></p> <p>— Tyler James (@FreakyMusic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreakyMusic_/status/1976666403723006090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1974844687484641683%7Ctwgr%5Ebe0e9b592c93c25f20d70e73f251027fe236f8e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-lead-tempts-fate-says-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-after-numerous-betas-across-pc-and-consoles%2F">previously</a> seemed confident that the sequel would be prepared to welcome in the flood of day-one players following months of beta hype and promising feedback. DICE was quick to point out that login queues are part of trying to keep the ramp-up process “smooth and stable for everyone.” That didn’t stop fans from jabbing each other with screenshots of their positions on social media and the Battlefield subreddit. Long before anyone has a KDA to brag about in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, fans are turning to queue positions as high-score markers of elite status. Can anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o340g7/i_think_people_are_trying_to_play_bf6_idk_maybe/">beat 458,400</a>?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro….<br>how doe i play the game now? <a href="https://t.co/wMwXmmHGWm">pic.twitter.com/wMwXmmHGWm</a></p> <p>— DjKr4m3r Gaming (@djkr4m3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/djkr4m3r/status/1976671821476073568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But other players have been facing a strange issue in which, even after getting into the game, they would be asked to install it. “Running into an error with <em>Battlefield 6</em> that states I need to install multiplayer, and it shows me all the files I need to install,” one wrote on X. “Does anyone have any fixes? I’m afraid I’m going to have to queue again.” <a href="https://x.com/NachoCapart/status/1976678451252953251">Someone else</a> even tried deleting the game, reinstalling everything, and queuing again to try and get in. “If it works, please tell me,” another player wrote back.</p>

 <p>So far, EA has said it’s aware of the problem but hasn’t shared advice on how to address it. “We’re aware of an issue preventing players from accessing the game with some receiving an error stating they need to purchase DLC or similar,” it announced around noon on Friday. “Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000634048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634048">Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In the meantime, <em>Battlefield 6</em> seems well on its way to living up to to the initial blitz of player interest some had been predicting. Data firm Ampere Analysis <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">told <em>The Game Business</em></a> it was forecasting 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone. If all of them login within the first 24 hours, the fall blockbuster will be well on its way to being Steam’s most-played game so far this month.</p> <p>To break into the top 10 of all-time highest concurrent player counts, it’ll need to beat <em>Banana</em>‘s 917,000 record. The top spot is still held by <em>PUBG</em> at over 3.2 million players simultaneously. EA will probably be content with having already edged out its own free-to-play giant <em>Apex Legends</em>, though. No wonder Activision seems so worried <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176">about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year</a>. It’s the first time in six years it’s had to go head-to-head with a <em>Battlefield</em> that had a single-player campaign, even if this one has <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">left many critics overwhelmed</a>.</p>

The bad news, the prices might be a little too hot to handle for some. Here's what's available, alongside some handy tips on how to find the restocked items and even just a little less right now.</p><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227468"><div id="227468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elite Trainer Box (Mega Gardevoir)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's start things off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpbl?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box (ETB)</a>. You're getting nine Mega Evolution booster packs, one full-art foil promo card featuring Riolu or Alakazam, 65 card sleeves, 40 energy cards, a player’s guide to the Mega Evolution expansion, six damage-counter dice, one competition-legal coin-flip die, and the collector’s box to hold everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MSRP is $49.99, but these run at a 100% markup right now, and the market price sits around $90-$100 at the time of writing. So, while Amazon does have this in stock, it is also listed at <em>market </em>price ($99.99), not MSRP. It's good for those who have the cash and want an easy and reliable free delivery. You might even have some gift card credit leftover you want to use.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mega Evolution Booster Bundle is in similar situation, and in stock for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgykM?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$59.99 at Amazon</a>. That's around a 100% markup from the MSRP of $29.99. It includes six Mega Evolution boosters, which works out at almost exactly $10 per pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, if those prices arent what you're looking for, you're next best bet for finding ETBs or Booster Bundles for the new set is via trusted resale sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7Gpv?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. In my opinion its the best place to find sealed booster sets like these, and often enough it's cheaper than paying directly through Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, that's certainly the case, as you can buy the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRDGx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ETB for around $90-$92</a> including shipping, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z12dY?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle for around $54-$56</a>. It's a small saving compared to Amazon, but still a saving nonetheless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mega Evolution Chase Cards</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Upcoming Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The closer we get to the November, the more likely you are to see the word "Black Friday" peppered across your every waking moment. Pokémon TCG deals during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales are a complicated beast, as it's unlikely you're going to find much at all that's actually below its original MSRP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something more immediate, the best advice I can give is to consider <a href="https://zdcs.link/weNPx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's Prime Visa Card</a>. If you're a Prime Member already, you'll bag a $150 gift card (that you can immediately use to buy Pokémon cards if you so wish), and up to 7% cashback on purchaes using the card. It's a little niche, but if you don't mind the credit check it's not a bad deal.</p></div><div catalogid="a6b8451e-4fef-449d-8d7e-2f84cb84f315" id="203056"><div id="203056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Visa Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>7% cashback on Amazon purchases, no annual fee</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not keen, for now you're better off holding out for another Walmart+ drop like the one that went down most recently. In case you missed the news, Walmart was granting early access to rare elusive TCG sets as part of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-collector-con-sale-includes-rare-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-boosters-prime-day">Collector Con sale</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prime-day-elite-trainer-box-discount-walmart-plus-early-access">Prismastic Evolution ETBs for $59.99</a>, a huge discount compared to the $200 minimum you’ll currently find on other marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxLBp?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a> for the same set. There was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-preorder-walmart-plus-early-access-in-stock">Phantasmal Flame preorders</a>, including ETBs for $55, another giant saving considering these go for $150+ resale right now as well. There was a bunch more included as well, such as action figures, Magic: The Gathering sets, and more, but you get the gist.</p></div><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access period, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don’t have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock sells out, most items are typically gone way before general buyers can even get a sniff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want to miss out on the next one, alongside any of Walmart's upcoming Black Friday deals (which they also put on early access for), I'd suggest picking up a Walmart+ membership when you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95/mo, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Motördoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>◆Career Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
◆Single Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
◆Endless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
◆Free Ride Mode<br>
◆Difficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
◆5 Arenas<br>
◆7 Characters<br>
◆5 Bosses<br>
◆35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
◆Unlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
◆Unlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> arrived last month on September 12–and some people are <i>still</i> waiting for shader compilation! That’s a preview of what you can expect in this edition of “As Told By Steam Reviews,” because, ya’ll, either this game really, truly runs that poorly or the mimetic nature of the internet is working overdrive here.</p> <p>You’ll quickly spot a trend when it comes to perusing <i>BL4</i>’s user reviews on Steam: Folks are generally struggling to enjoy this game&nbsp; not because of the story or the gunplay– the reviews mostly speak favorably of those elements. No, that pale orange “Mixed” review status on the game’s Steam page is the result of countless reviews trashing how this game runs, with particular ire directed toward Unreal Engine 5, and for Gearbox’s talkative CEO who also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">spent some time doubling as tech support</a> after this game’s bumpy release.</p>

 <p>It’s hard to find a negative review that doesn’t just meditate on the misery of eternal shader compilation and signature UE5 stuttering. But those who ain’t too hot on what <i>BL4</i> is selling seem to find the open world a little shallow. On top of that, there are some who seem to just prefer <i>BL2</i>’s writing over the narrative and dialogue here.</p> <p>Positive reviews, however, reflect that <i>Borderlands</i>’ gun-handling has come a long way since the awkwardness it exhibited of the earlier entries. It feels like a more refined shooter experience than ever, and, to some at least, it seems the writing is much better.</p> <p>So let’s get onto <i>Borderlands 4</i>, as told by Steam reviews!</p> <h2>‘Who are you and what have you done to the borderlands writing team?!’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634026"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634026">© Screenshot: Valve / SkeleBen / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘You straight up can’t play this game if you’re broke.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634029">© Screenshot: Valve / OnionMuncher / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634030">© Screenshot: Valve / Mister Macaroni / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘The structure of the balance, postgame and gear has actual thought behind it for once.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634031">© Screenshot: Valve / LazyData / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634032"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634032">© Screenshot: Valve / Tchii / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Borderlands 4 feels like that first sip of an energy drink at 2 AM when you know you’re gaming all night.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634034">© Screenshot: Valve / Shinigami/ Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Most importantly the writing has taken a step in the right direction.’</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634036">© Screenshot: Valve / Xzanos / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‘Randy needs to get off twitter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed the latest in its&nbsp;<em>Universes Beyond&nbsp;</em>series of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossovers, and I hope you're ready to get tubular, because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are on their way to a tabletop near you.</p>

<p>Launching on March 6th, the new&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set will feature new sets of boosters, as well as a brand new Commander deck featuring none other than the Turtles' leader himself, Leonardo.</p>

<p>Per a press release, while Leonardo will serve as the Commander deck's face commander, you'll also be able to take advantage of a new mechanic that allows you to combine the strength of two Commanders with the Partner ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.jpg?itok=gK42susb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.jpg?itok=YzfXN5-D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to slam that Turtle Power down on the table.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Wizards promises that the new&nbsp;<em>Turtles&nbsp;</em>set for&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for any&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>fan, whether you're a diehard fan of the original Kevin Eastman artwork or a newer convert thanks to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Mutant Mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>Eastman himself has returned to illustrate the new set's four headliner cards, which all feature "original borderless artwork" by the&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>creator, as well as a "shiny stamp" of his signature.</p>

<p>Additionally, existing&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>cards will be tricked out with&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em>-themed artwork in the new set's Collector Boosters. Wizards has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Turtles</em>-themed version of Doubling Season, but there are 20 source material cards with new artwork in total.</p>

<p>Not only that, but lands in the new set will be decked out with new full-art pizza variants as part of new Pizza Bundles, although Wizards promises that "the toppings are sure to be contentious". I think that's probably an understatement, given what we've seen so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-set-special-cards.jpg?itok=M3wVGIr8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-set-special-cards.jpg?itok=u3ZPcBv0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are some pretty special-looking new cards in the&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>is just the latest property to get the&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossover treatment. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy</a>&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-made-200m-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">proved a hugely successful crossover</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a>, and Marvel's very own Merc with a Mouth <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow">Deadpool</a>, among many others.</p>

<p>The news also comes just a few months after the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow">screenwriters were announced</a>&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Gardner and&nbsp;<em>Calls&nbsp;</em>scribe Aidan Fitzgerald.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set launches on March 6th, with pre-release events happening between February 27th and March 5th. A full decklist for the Turtle Power! Commander deck will be revealed "closer to the set's release", according to Wizards.</p>

            <p>Drive faster, she screams as a cacophony of meepy noises, it's coming! I know, headstand lady, I know, comes my response from behind the wheel. We'd be safe if I hadn't botched one of the switchbacks and gently skidded into a low wall. I'd best put my foot down if I want to escape the demo of mysterious delivery driver Truckful without finding out what happens when a little truck is swallowed by a bigger truck.</p>

<p>This is the sort of mystery promised by Truckful's trundling down otherwise picturesque forest lanes and tracks. Another mystery is how you, the player, ended up permanently stuck in the cab of a plucky little pickup. The game tries to play that one one off as a joke. To be fair, the pretty brief and linear demo is keen to get on with the quick slice of a day and night's trucking it offers to delve too deep into any mysteries just yet.</p>
<p>Assuming the rest of the game follows suit, your time when the sun's up in Truckful is spent making deliveries to various locations. I had to pick up a lady called Rotti whose van had broken down. I pulled up behind it and loaded both her and her cargo into my pickup's bed. There's some nice physics stacking to packing seven objects into just four slots, and amid the precarious balancing I discover that I can flip items upside down. I have to pack Rotti in the back too, so decide to plonk her on her bonce. She doesn't seem to mind. </p><p>Truckful's side-on camera and narrow, windy roads aren't too challenging when your only obstacle's the occasional herd of sheep blocking the road, but they are tricky enough to punish carelessness. My racing instincts kicked in at one point while descending a hill, and the resulting bunch of flowers sent flying from the truck bed instantly failed the mission and sent me back to the previous roadside checkpoint.</p>
<p>Delivering the goods to an old lady's garage was repaid by her restoring the truck's lights and horn, allowing myself and Rotti to venture out into the night. Rotti now elected to sit the right way up and in the passenger seat, which I found slightly disappointing. Just as the darkness was making the game's chill woodland vibes really sing, a great noise erupted behind us. A haunting horn, somewhere between an air raid siren that needs to blow its nose and a cargo ship's mournful cry. The ghost truck. Despite the need to haul ass making the flowing turns even tougher to thread through, I was on track to easily outrun the beast until the mistake. The fact I survived and was able to re-open a gap pretty rapidly on the way out of the woods maybe suggests the revenant rig will need to up its game to be a threat.</p>
<p>This was only a short taste of Truckful though, so there's every chance it does. I've come out of it still in two minds as to whether the game'll have much to offer in terms of in-depth mysterious substance beyond the initial spectral semi intrigue, but what I've played certainly wasn't lacking in charm or chill driving atmos.</p>
<p>Truckful's set to release in 2026, and you can find this new demo on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI’s all-encompassing usefulness is now well beyond debate. A stellar AI tool is great. An AI tool on sale for 82% off is even better. An AI tool on sale for 82% off that you can also stack with a special checkout code that drops another $10 from the price and gives you a lifetime subscription for just $30? That’s downright unbeatable, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">that’s what’s waiting for you right how at StackSocial — a lifetime license to 1min.AI is all yours for $30.</a></p>
<p>1min.AI also spares you from doing the deep dive to find out which of the ever-growing number of AI models is the best one to use, because 1min.AI is not an AI model — it’s a smorgasbord of several AI models all in one interface. So if you’re already signed up for several model subscriptions, now’s your chance to streamline them, reduce your bills, and not miss out on any of the latest AI advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Newbies Welcome</h2>
<p>Even if you’re just now dipping your toe into the AI pond (which is more like an ocean by now), and the idea of suddenly having several different models at your fingertips is intimidating, there’s no need for concern. 1min.AI is amazingly accessible even for newbies. The intuitive user interface is easy to learn once you start feeding it text and/or images and asking it to generate your desired output.</p>
<p>If you’re working with visuals, you can even backtrack if you don’t like what 1min.AI has done with your creative suggestions. It has a Generative Remove tool to take out unwanted elements, giving you ultimate control over your own creative vision. And that vision can take its form virtually any way you like when you deploy the AI models of 1min.AI: image generation, keyword research, content creation — it’s basically limitless.</p>



<h2>One Payment, All the Power</h2>
<p>The one-time purchase of a lifetime subscription to 1min.AI gives you access to AI models including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3, MistralAI, Command, and more. In time you’ll find which one suits your needs best, and the odds are different needs will be handled best by different models.</p>
<p>The lifetime subscription to 1min.AI’s Pro plan is all-inclusive, with all future updates covered — no recurring costs or monthly fees buried in the small print. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">It normally sells for $234, but StackSocial’s 82% off deal brings the price down to $40, and when you add the code <strong>SAVE10</strong> at checkout, the price gets knocked down to just $30</a>. It doesn’t require any artificial intelligence to see what a great deal this is.</p>

              <p>How will Radiance Cores make make web-slinging even better in <em>Spider-Man 3</em>? How much of<em> Battlefield 7</em> will be AI-generated once Saudi Arabia takes over? And why is licensed DLC fueling a <em>Sonic</em> kart-racing renaissance? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Eagles spiked another one last night. Now begins the annual Philly football crashout before things start to recover after Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>The architect behind Sony’s upcoming gaming hardware sat down with AMD’s senior VP of computing, Jack Huynh, to discuss how the two companies’ joint partnership in advancing GPU tech will make Joel’s beard in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> look even more awe-inducing on next-gen hardware. They talked about Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression. No, these aren’t <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842?s=19"><em>Destiny 2</em> patch notes</a>, they’re a roadmap to what will seemingly make gaming on PS6 marginally better than current-gen tech.</p>

 <p>In layman’s terms, it’s all supposed to mean more efficiency that lets developers draw better performance and visual fidelity out of the existing GPU. It will seemingly scale with AI tech to give you more bang for your buck across the spectrum, whether you’re playing on a high-end living room console or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s coming. Cerny didn’t call out the PS6 by name but did suggest it will be here in the next “few years.”</p>

 <p>“Overall, it’s of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now,” he said. “But the results are quite promising and I’m really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years’ time.” Microsoft is also working with AMD on its next-gen hardware, which it <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">promises it hasn’t canceled</a>.</p>

 <h2>Players are having too much fun with the new <em>Minecraft</em> pack in <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> pack arrived in-game this week and costs $6 for the addition of Steve, Alex, Creeper, the<em> Minecraft</em> vehicle and World course, and other cosmetics. Sonic fans are already calling it “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s4wa/the_minecraft_track_is_peak/">peak</a>.” Sonic can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s1eo/lol_most_sonic_characters_barely_stick_out_the/">barely see out over the top</a> of the <em>Minecraft</em> cart vehicle. In no other game can you have a Creeper race Shadow while riding in a Hatsune Miku box.</p>

The actor played Charles Vane in <em>Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</em> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">which is currently getting an unannounced remake</a>) and more recently Cid in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> and Lorath Nahr in<em> Diablo 4</em>. He <a href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-ralph-ineson-suit-1851786828">also played Galactus</a> in this year’s<em> Fantastic Four </em>movie.

 <h2>EA exec calls generative AI “very seducing”</h2> <p>Speaking of everyone’s favorite $1 trillion Ponzi scheme, EA’s general manager of DICE and Criterion Games, Rebecka Coutaz, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the <em>BBC</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6"><em>IGN</em></a>) that there is no generative AI in the finished version of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, though the technology is used early in the development process “to allow more time and more space to be creative.” CEO Andrew Wilson previously told investors that AI was going to be at the heart of everything the company does moving forward, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">some developers within the company</a> have told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> there’s new pressure from above to experiment with AI tools wherever possible.</p>

 <p><em>The Financial Times</em> reported that EA’s new Saudi and private equity owners are banking on an AI transformation to help it pay off $20 billion in debt. &nbsp;“If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,” Coutaz told the<em> BBC</em>.</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em>‘s new Ghostface mythic weapon is wrecking people</h2>   <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueskynoise.com/post/3m2rxomnvss2u">The Last Call Knife</a> changes your costume to the <em>Scream</em> icon and offers voice lines and a speed bonus.

Players can also pick up Leatherface’s weapon from<em> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> but it’s apparently not as good. “Just so everyone knows, Ghostface beats chainsaw.

At least there’s not a game key card in sight though for these HD remasters. Square Enix must know their fans are marks.

<p>Battlefield 6 has launched, and its all-time player peak on Steam keeps rising by the second, with the number sitting at over 700k at the time of writing, surpassing Call of Duty’s record. </p>



<p>The anticipation for Battlefield 6’s launch has been at an all-time high since the open-beta weekends, where players flocked in huge numbers. However, the beta has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller maps</a> and fewer features to try out. The full version of BF6 has been released right now, and players are pouring in by the thousands. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-all-time-steam-peak-surpasses-700k-within-the-first-hour">Battlefield 6 All-Time Steam Peak Surpasses 700k Within the First Hour</h2>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6’s all-time Steam peak concurrent number sits at 704,005 at the time of writing, and the number keeps going higher every time you refresh the page. That’s not all, Battlefield 6’s launch numbers on Steam have also beaten Call of Duty’s all-time peak, which stands at 491,670. </p>



<p>The game has additionally beaten its all-time peak from the open beta weekends, which sat at 521,000. Moreover, it is just Friday; a whole weekend remains, so the number could go even higher as the days go on. </p>



<p>For those who haven’t checked out the title, Battlefield 6 brings back iconic all-out warfare, where players can wage war with infantry and vehicle combat, including fighter jets, tanks, and more. The game features tactical destruction, where players destroy their surroundings to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents. The title also introduces the new Kinesthetic Combat System, a global-scale campaign, several multiplayer modes, the massive sandbox mode, Portal, and an upcoming battle royale mode. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not use generative AI</a>. Also, players are already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">During its panel at New York Comic Con, Playground Productions not only looked back on the return and relaunch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backyard-sports-revival-officially-announced-by-playground-productions">the beloved Backyard Sports video games,</a> but it also announced it will be completing its Backyard Sports retro collection with Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 in mid-November, that there are high scores and events coming to Backyard Baseball '97, and it shared a few new details for the series' upcoming animated special. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more, IGN had the chance to speak to Playground Productions CEO Linday Barnett and Chief Product Officer Chris Waters about the past and future of this fan-favorite franchise, and we began by chatting about what makes these games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We think it works because the games have always been character-first, comedy-forward, and accessible," Waters said. "These games weren't, 'Hey, let's make the most incredibly realistic simulation,' they were, 'let's recreate the experience of what it felt like to go out and pick up a bat and a ball, grab whatever friends you had around whether they're athletic or not, and go out and play baseball and see what madness ensues.' That madness transcends time and transcends technology." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Backyard Sports' Retro Library Will Be Complete in Mid-November, New Features Headed to Backyard Baseball '97</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you are new to the franchise or returning to it, you'll be happy to know that the Backyard Sports retro library will be complete when Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 are released on Steam in mid-November. Oh, and did we mention both will be free to download and keep?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These games, alongside Baseball '97, Baseball '01, Football '99, Soccer '98, will also be part of the Backyard Sports Retro Bundle, which will be available for $26 - a 40% savings from buying all the games individually. Players will even be able to 'Complete the Set' and only pay for the games you don't have yet at the cheaper price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the Backyard Soccer '98 and Backyard Basketball '01 mobile versions will be free on iOS and Android when that Steam retro bundle goes live later next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of mobile, Backyard Baseball '97 is getting a new gamification feature in collaboration with Lucra. Fans can now compete against each other in week-long and month-long events like Home Run Competitions or Most Strikeouts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/123-1760093189150.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Global high scores will be tracked in real-time, and the new feature will be free for fans and even includes a chance to win tickets to the 2025 World Series, a Pablo Sanchez trading card, and more. This feature will begin on iOS to start, and players will need to opt-iin and provide some personal information. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we want to do is allow that community to grow and for players to be able to engage with each other," Waters said of the new gamification features. "And again, without the source code, we can't make these games, but by adding a tournament layer onto them, we're sort of creating a backdoor co-op mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact, Playground Productions did not get the source code for most of these games when they acquired the rights, so the team had to hack the old CD-ROMs and rebuilt the games themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought those games were just dead," Barrnett told us. "And it was an incredible feat that Mega Kat Studios was able to do, which is reverse engineer and hack the CD-ROMs to make them playable. The thing that we didn't know in all of this, however, was that we'd be able to make the games even better and we were able to remove certain bugs that existed in the original games and add leaderboards and add competitions and just make them playable on systems that didn't even exist back then, like Nintendo Switch."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Backyard Sports Includes an Animated Special That Just Finished Production</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our talk to the future. While the team wasn't ready to reveal anything about future games, they did confirm that Backyard Sports officially wrapped production on their new animated special that builds upon the brand's beloved IP and characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This special is being produced by Lighthouse Studios, which is known for its work on Bob's Burgers and Rick &amp; Morty, and it will feature an "all-star cast" that will be announced in early November. As for when you can see it, the special will be released at Dave &amp; Buster's in early 2026 and direct to consumer shortly after. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What makes Backyard Sports special is the characters," Waters said. "For us, the opportunity to take your favorite characters and bring them to life in a new way was a no-brainer as we've already said this is a multi-platform franchise we want to go beyond games. We all loved how beautiful the animation was in the games and how much love and care they put in, and it made you love and understand the characters and made you want to pick a certain character. So, we are really, really humbled to be able to extend that into more animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This special was our way of establishing a tone, establishing a look, and really putting our flag down to say, Backyard is a multi-platform franchise. You're going to be able to experience it in lots of different ways. I can't wait until we can say more, but I can promise you that I've got a 20-year history in animation and we have pulled out all the stops to make something that captures the tone and magic and comedy of this world."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/20240818-055213000-ios-1724085212284-1760093211100.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">First look at the Backyard Sports revival from 2024, featuring Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Backyard Sports, the team wants these games and multimedia projects to showcase just how fun sports can be and for this new generation to enjoy all of this alongside those that grew up with them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Streamers have picked these games up and people aren't watching them because they're amazing video game players," Waters said. "They're watching them because they're bringing these kids to life through their own lens. It reminds you of what it was like to play baseball the first time you picked up a glove and a bat and a ball and you were just playing for fun. I think that's been the big thing for why this really is a timeless and classic franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is celebrating all of the different characters in your backyard and all their strengths and maybe even some of the weaknesses," Barnett added. "You laugh and you get through everything together. You play together and you might win, you might lose, but you always had fun doing it. And unfortunately, a lot of sports, not just sports video games, but also just sports in general aren't really like that anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You repeatedly refused to listen."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 90 staff who worked on this year's blockbuster flop <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> have sent a searing open letter to the company's management calling for change, after "one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> states that between 250 and 300 staff have now lost their jobs due to MindsEye's failure, something which is blamed squarely on the decisions of company bosses. There's strong criticism, too, of the way layoffs were handled, with the suggestion that misinformation may have lead to the "wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter, published through UK game development worker union IWGB, calls on MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy, and specifically its founder Leslie Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, to apologise for the "mistreatment" of staff and provide "proper compensation for laid-off employees," as well as make improvements to layoff processes, ahead of what sounds like expected "future reduncies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"For years, you have expected [employees] to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside," the letter reads. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Examples of issues faced due to management failures include "radical changes" to working practices with little explanation, "confusion and distress for all staff" as redundancies began — including various errors in the dismissal process, and four months of mandatory overtime ahead of MindsEye's launch for which staff say they still have not been fully compensated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These and many other issues," the letter continues, "have caused pain and stress for your employees. Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email to IGN, the IWGB provided further quotes from former staff members backing up the letter's claims. One ex-MindsEye developer said that Build A Rocket Boy's "public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions" at the company. Another detailed seeing "mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the usual burnout" among fellow staff due to the months of overtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this," one former employee stated, referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">the bizarre comments made by Gerhard ahead of release</a> that blamed unnamed hostile forces for the game's poor reception — a position that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">MindsEye publisher IO Interactive later distanced itself from</a>. "The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/barb-image-04-1500x1125-1760105423781.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally planned as a single-player component for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everywhere-the-ex-gta-devs-game-creator-that-may-be-too-late-to-the-party">Everywhere, a seemingly now-abandoned metaverse-style platform</a>, MindsEye ultimately launched to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-says-its-working-around-the-clock-to-improve-performance-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">negative response and lackluster sales</a>. Build a Rocket Boy has since said it wants to continue working on the game and give it something of a relaunch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-delays-hitman-crossover-update-says-updates-may-be-less-frequent-going-forward">though more recently cautioned that this would take longer than planned</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter concludes with demands for a public apology and proper compensation, for remaining staff still at risk of redundancy to take payment in leave of notice, a commitment to use an external partner in future layoffs to prevent unfair treatment, and for a "concerted, meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring McparlinJones said in a statement passed to IGN. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: IWGB </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">At the end of 2022, an unknown number of online leagues in Madden 23 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/">deleted overnight</a> due to what EA called a "data-storage issue that resulted in Franchise files being corrupted." Some players who were affected eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-restores-a-limited-number-of-madden-cloud-franchises-others-lost-for-good/1100-6510742/">got their leagues back</a>, while others never did. The total number of affected players or leagues was never revealed, but it wasn't an especially rare event, as the game's subreddit, EA Forums, and various Discord servers were flooded with players decrying their leagues' disappearances. Now, in Madden 26, something similar seems to be happening.</p><p dir="ltr">It hasn't occurred in one fell swoop, and a different--possibly more hopeful--error message is greeting affected players, but it's unclear why it's happening or if affected leagues can be salvaged.</p><p dir="ltr">The error message some players are getting reads, "Error: The requested league is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience. You have been returned to the Franchise launcher."</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, this is the message players may see if they try to access their league while a patch is being rolled out. But in this case, some players have been stuck staring at this message for weeks. One player in my league said his other league has been inaccessible for a month and a half. Yesterday, our 32-player league was hit with the same bug. We're now tentatively structuring our Plan B in case we need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of forum threads in which players are worried about their leagues having become permanently unavailable, like <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/re-franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12680427" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12702061" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-franchise-is-temporarily-unavailable/12646488" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. In fact, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/category/madden-nfl-26-en/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en" rel="nofollow">browsing by Franchise-related posts turns up many similar threads</a>. Naturally, the same is happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1o29f5l/madden_franchise_error/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234"></a><figcaption>Madden leagues are locking players out without apparent rhyme or reason.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if the issue is happening more recently, but it's definitely affecting different leagues at different times, rather than hitting a number of leagues all at once like in 2022. Some players have reported that their leagues came back to life after a few days, while others have given up after weeks of waiting. On the EA Forums, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-league-error/12635493/replies/12725728" rel="nofollow">community manager provided an update yesterday</a>, saying, "Apologies for the late reply on this one. We have notified the team that this has been happening with the leagues, and they are currently investigating this. Once we have more info on these or need any further information, we will update this thread."</p><p dir="ltr">This latest Franchise lockout doesn't seem to be occurring for the same reasons as when it happened in late 2022, but for affected players, the result is the same: A great deal of investment, sometimes hundreds of hours, is getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted EA for comment on this issue and will update this story if the publisher responds.</p>

                <p>EA's long-awaited and heavily hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> is finally out now, and it's off to a hot start on Steam. Within the game's first 30 minutes of public availability, it exceeded 500,000 concurrent users, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Steam's own data.</a> The free games Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are the only two games rank higher than Battlefield 6 currently.</p><p>At press time, Battlefield 6 stands at more than 606,000 concurrent players on Steam.</p><p>A massive launch for Battlefield 6 was expected. One analyst said the game reached nearly 2 million preorders, generating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">more than $100 million in revenue prior to launch.</a> In the time it took to write this post, Battlefield 6 added more than 100,000 more players on Steam.</p><p>GameSpot will continue to update this post as Battlefield 6's player numbers inevitably grow today and this weekend. In the US, it's a long weekend with a holiday on Monday.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is, of course, also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. However, the platform-holders do not share up-to-the-minute player data like Valve does with Steam.</p><p>So far, the Battlefield 6 servers appear to be holding up against the influx of players. Players are being placed into server queues to help mitigate the demand.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has just launched and already players are facing huge queues as servers reach maximum capacity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683">David Sirland stated on social media</a> the team was planning for launch day queues, adding the "open beta helped gauge the interest as well".</p>
<p>Indeed, the beta - which ran in August - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">almost 250,000 players waiting in queues ahead of its launch</a>. It would seem, so far, launch day queues for the full game are just as busy.</p>

<p>The game's beta proved so popular it reached a concurrent player count of almost 300,000 on Steam.</p>
<p>"Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">our Battlefield 6 review</a>.</p>
