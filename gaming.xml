            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/17/24221765/asus-rog-ally-gaming-handheld-roborock-q-revo-robot-vacuum-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that the new and improved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> has arrived, we’re starting to see some solid deals on its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>. Now until August 19th, for instance, the Windows-based gaming handheld is available at <a href="https://howl.me/cmTzQhkZw2e">Best Buy</a> with a Z1 Extreme chip for an all-time low of $499.99 ($150 off). That’s almost half the price of its successor, which costs $799.99, rendering it a good alternative if you’re on a tighter budget. The lower-end model with the Z1 chip is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cmTBM70duIl">$379.99 ($120)</a>, though, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23879024/asus-rog-ally-600-z1-gaming-handheld-steam-deck">given the performance downgrades</a>, we’d recommend sticking with the Extreme configuration.</p><p>At this price, the standard Asus ROG Ally offers good value, even if it didn’t impress us as much as ROG Ally X when it comes to comfort, performance, or battery life. It’s still more powerful than Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a>, though, thanks to its Z1 Extreme chip and enhanced performance when the handheld is plugged in and engaged in “Turbo” mode. It also features a quieter fan and a larger 1080p display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, the latter of which is surprisingly smooth for its size.</p><p>Unfortunately, its battery only lasts a mediocre four hours at best, which is disappointing given it’s designed to be a portable gaming PC. It’s also held back the Windows 11, which isn’t well-designed for small, handheld-like devices. That said, Valve is working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">adding support for SteamOS</a> on rival handhelds&nbsp;like Asus’ ROG Ally, so perhaps we could see it running an alternative operating system down the line. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Read our Asus ROG Alley review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival. It’s a Windows-based PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch 1080p, 120Hz touchscreen and integrated gamepad controls.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more weekend discounts</h3></p><div><ul><li>If you’d like to dive even deeper into the <em>Alien</em> universe after watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a><em> </em>this weekend, a few retailers are currently discounting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"><em><strong>Alien: Isolation</strong></em></a>, a video game that takes place 15 years after the original <em>Alien </em>film.

That’s about half the price the Robovac typically sells for in new condition. The Q Revo is a highly capable cleaning machine, one that features a pair of oscillating mops that scrub floors remarkably well. It can also fill its own reservoir, clean and dry up its own mopping pads, and even self-empty. It lets you set virtual keep-out zones, too, which <em>almost</em> makes up for the fact it lacks AI obstacle avoidance.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea may seem eccentric on its face, but some experts emphasize that it’s really no different than any other kind of money left in a trust.</p><p>“All 50 states recognize some form of a pet trust, thanks, in part, to the Uniform Trust Code, which has a provision recognizing and enforcing pet trusts,” Berry told the Washington Post.</p><p>Like with human cases, when a (furry) beneficiary of a trust dies, it’s up to the trustee to follow the next steps - whether that’s dissolving the trust or following instructions on where to distribute the funds.</p><p>It is also becoming increasingly common for people to explicitly state where they want their pets to live – in an effort to avoid family disputes and ensure animals don’t end up in shelters.</p><p>Experts recommend creating explicit provisions about wills during estate planning to ensure the animal doesn’t languish for months or even years, while humans work out their ownership disputes.</p><p>“Most people think that their family members will do the right thing and care for these animals, but our experience shows it’s just not true,” Eldad Hagar, co-founder of the Los Angeles pet rescue charity Hope for Paws, told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/you-love-your-dog-should-she-be-in-your-will-a2af9b04?mod=lifestyle_lead_pos4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/you-love-your-dog-should-she-be-in-your-will-a2af9b04?mod=lifestyle_lead_pos4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a></span>. “So many times they end up at the shelter to be euthanized.”</p><p>Continue reading to learn more about animals who received inheritances from their owners.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff9b3ed5685f0962435b2b980b891667" data-recommend-id="image://ff9b3ed5685f0962435b2b980b891667" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="683" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Choupette is pictured on the LucyBalu stand during the LucyBalu Product Presentation at Paris Nord Villepinte on September 09, 2022 in Paris, France.</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Julien M.

The blue-cream Birman cat made such a mark on pop culture that both Doja Cat and Jared Leto wore Choupette-inspired costumes to the 2023 Met Gala. Lagerfeld made it clear that he would leave part of his fortune to Choupette – referring to her as a “little heiress.” While it’s unclear exactly how much she inherited, Choupette was already independently a millionaire from her life as a kitty-influencer.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-recommend-id="image://b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="2121" data-height="1414" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty/istock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Leslie Ann Mandel left $100,000 to her cockatiels (not pictured)</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->yellowsarah<!-- --> (<!-- -->iStock by Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-recommend-id="image://b85ac1e11428ca7d7263b32b308751bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="2121" data-height="1414" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After her 2015 death, Manhattan entrepreneur Leslie Ann Mandel left $100,000 to her 32 cockatiels, along with a request that the birds continue to reside in her Hamptons home.

Posner’s son disputed the will in court, arguing that his mother was taken advantage of by her staff while she was dying. He also alleged that staff members convinced his mother to push a media narrative that her chihuahua, Conchita, was spoiled, in an effort to justify leaving a fortune to her pets.<br></p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Quartz, our sister site, on Monday, August 12.</em></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Video game actors are calling for better transparency around "disgusting" motion capture work that is not properly disclosed at the point of booking.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23l4ml51jmo">BBC</a>, professional casting director Jessica Jefferies - who previously worked as a motion capture performer - recalled times she'd be called for a shoot with absolutely no information about what the work entailed, only to find out that it included "gratuitous" sex scenes.</p>
<p>"We'd get an email or a call from a studio saying we need you on these days for a shoot," she explained. "That was all the information we'd get.</p>
<p>"I turned up and was told what I would be filming would be a graphic rape scene. This act could be watched for as long or as little time as the player wanted through a window, and then a player would be able to shoot this character in the head.</p>
<p>"It was just purely gratuitous, in my opinion."</p>
<p>Jefferies says that even though there's no nudity due to the motion capture suits worn, "it's still an act and there's an intimacy in that act, and also a violence in this situation".</p>
<p>"You are still there and still having to truly immerse yourself in this scene," she added.</p>
<p>A different actor who chose to remain anonymous said she "absolutely loves the industry", but also calls for better disclosures ahead of time, especially as actors "have to sign NDAs" and are "told almost nothing" ahead of filming.</p>
<p>"In one recording for a major game she first learned it was explicit only when she turned up for work. This was actually a full-on sex scene," she said.</p>
<p>"I had to [vocally] match the scene and through the glass in the booth with the entire team, all male, watching me. It was excruciating... at that stage I had been in the games industry a while, and I had never felt so shaken.</p>
<p>"What upset me so much about the situation is I was put on the spot, nobody thought to ask me if I was okay with it, and nobody checked to see if I was okay afterwards," she added.</p>
<p>The UK's games industry trade body, Ukie, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.</p>
<p>However, in relation to guidelines drawn up by the British Actors Union, Equity, the organisation said its focus "remains on fostering a supportive environment for all stakeholders in the UK video game sector, ensuring it remains the best place to create, play, and sell video games".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-romantic-scenes-used-intimacy-coordinators">hired intimacy coordinators</a> to ensure its actors felt safe and comfortable during romantic scenes.</p>
<p>In an earlier interview with BBC, actor Devora Wilde - who plays githyanki warrior Lae'zel in the critically-acclaimed release - said she was pleased with Larian's decision to do so.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Fast Travel Games has revealed Action Hero for Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro, an action-packed FPS that will throw you onto movie sets to battle ninjas, punch dinosaurs, and race along speeding trains.</p>
<p><iframe title="Action Hero | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCmf6caZIHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay seems to take a leaf out of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/07/19/superhot-vr-review/">Superhot VR’s book</a>, with everything happening in slow motion and then only speeding up as you, the player, physically move. It’s a clever way of helping to make things more manageable, and will no doubt be a pretty cool effect in this setting.</p>
<p>Action Hero will present you with five different movies to play through – so there’s no need for Fast Travel to concoct a story to explain how ninjas and dinosaurs are coexisting, as fun as that might be.</p>
<p>It’s coming soon exclusively for Meta Quest 2 and newer, which will no doubt be a bit of a disappointment for PSVR 2 diehards and PC VR enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The studio had a bunch of other announcements during the VR Games Showcase this week, confirming that they’re bringing CM Games’ Into The Radius to PSVR 2 next month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Into The Radius | PS VR2 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dNtBCybOrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They’re also bringing their hide-and-seek shooter Mannequin out of Early Access, with a full launch on Quest 3 and PC VR on 12th September.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mannequin | Official Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH7GXeXfH4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And they’ll publish Smartmelon Games’ Rock Band-alike VR game Band Space later this year for Quest and PC VR.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Band Space | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOqJgnAfzeM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

		<p>Devolver Digital and developer All Possible Futures have&nbsp;<em>finally</em> announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>. This charming adventure will launch on 17th September for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Nintendo Switch and PC. Oh, and it will be available day one via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DpvZWrts_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The plucky Squire tells the story of Joy and his friends, who have to save the lands from the evil Humgrump in a page-turning action adventure storybook. However, with his demise inevitable, Humgrump casts a last ditch magical spell that tears through the fabric of the bookish world and kicks Jot out into the 3D world around it.</p>
<p>Now Jot will have to adventure between multiple worlds, battling through the 3D world and hopping into 2D spaces that could be the pages of a book, the side of a coffee mug, and plenty more. He’ll pick up new abilities on the way, such as grabbing a jetpack, and fight against all manner of foes, like getting into a boxing fight with a badger, or use a newfound bow and arrow to defeat a ranged enemy.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention to Devolver Digital for the last few years, you might recognise the art style of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/21/swords-of-ditto-mormos-curse-switch-review-update/">The Swords of Ditto</a> in the 2D segments, and there’s a very good reason for that. This game is coming from Bidds, who’s now no longer of One Bit Beyond fame, but a part of All Possible Futures alongside former Pokémon designer James Turner.</p>

<p>We got to play the game at Gamescom last year, with Dom saying, “The Plucky Squire takes a few lines from The Legend of Zelda, a paragraph or two from Mario, and borrows a couple of footnotes from Pixar, but its clear that All Possible Futures are writing their own story. Based on Gamescom 2023, it’s heading straight to the top of the bestsellers list.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-shows-pc-features-in-new-trailer.955731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-shows-pc-features-in-new-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Star Wars Outlaws just a couple of weeks away from launch, Ubisoft has shared a new official PC gameplay trailer that shows off the main features of this version. Most of them have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented </a>with the help of NVIDIA, starting with RTX Direct Illumination. In the comparison below, we can see that ground details are much more noticeable when RTXDI is enabled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-RTXDI-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game also supports ray traced global illumination and ray traced reflections. On GeForce RTX GPUs, the quality of all ray traced effects is heightened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a>, also known as Ray Reconstruction. As we already saw when the technology was first introduced in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, reflections in particular are much sharper when Ray Reconstruction is enabled, and Star Wars Outlaws follows the same rule.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-RR-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, to achieve maximum performance, Star Wars Outlaws supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. In the trailer, we get a brief glimpse of the frame rate when both are activated. This looks like a cantina space with quite a few NPCs around, and the frame rate is hovering around 110 FPS. Of course, being an open world game, the frame rate might well be lower in other areas. Moreover, this was likely captured on the most powerful GPU currently on the market, the GeForce RTX 4090. Last but not least, NVIDIA Reflex is also supported.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SWO-FG-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the CPU front, the game has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-intel-cpu-launch-partner-star-wars-outlaws-14th-gen-optimizations-game-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimized</a> for Intel 14th Generation processors, offering 'CPU scaling performance optimizations'. A game bundle was available from April to July 31; those who took advantage of the offer, purchasing a new processor from eligible retailers, will get a free code ahead of launch.</p>

<p>The PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a couple of weeks ago by Ubisoft, but you can check them quickly in the infographic below. In case you don't meet the system requirements, there's always the cloud streaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-star-wars-outlaws-visions-of-mana-and-more-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option</a> via GeForce NOW.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GVIAtRrWgAAVgpd-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws is out on August 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the post-launch roadmap, which includes two story pack expansions, Wild Card (due in Fall 2024) and A Pirate's Fortune (slated in Spring 2025). For a full roundup of the game's available info, check our roundup <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wukong-gameplay-leak-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/30-minutes-of-black-myth-wukong-gameplay-leaks-online.955719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wukong-gameplay-leak-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is set to be released next week, and the leaks have already started showing. Most recently, a 30-minute gameplay video was uploaded to YouTube, showing an early boss fight sequence and some live exploration of the upcoming action-rich game. For as long as it stays up and online, you can check it out below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-average">Bigger Than Average</h2>



<p>The Black Myth: Wukong leaked gameplay video unfolds with the player going through an intense boss fight – but it’s mostly cinematic-based. In the first few minutes of the video, we see the protagonist, who is based on the ancient Chinese character ‘Sun Wukong’, fighting enormous enemies, all of whom are effectively kicking the snot out of him.</p>



<p>In one scene, one of them summons a gargantuan axe that’s powerful enough to cleave a mountain in half.</p>



<p>Once that’s over and done with, the character’s setting pivots (following more cutscenes), and the player is pulled into more of a tutorial setting. Over the next fifteen minutes, the story unravels as the player is tasked with fighting more low-level enemies in a dense forest punctuated with ancient ruins.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong _ Wukong vs Yang Jian (Erlang Shen) fight _ Gameplay Leak" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ALlQXqELb5Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There are some obvious time skips, which allow for some of the most interesting enemies in the game to be shown, such as a humanoid enemy with an enormous head standing as tall as a house.</p>



<p>It looks good – the combat isn’t anything too innovative, but it looks well-built and challenging, which is what people will expect coming into this game. The visuals are stunning and the cutscenes are cinematic enough to keep players engaged and immersed in the story.</p>



<p>Are you going to be picking up Black Myth: Wukong next week?</p>

The game was originally published by Sega for the Genesis in 1993, and the story revolved around a tournament to determine who the new Eternal Champion would be.

The winning participant would get to resume their life and fulfil their destiny as humanity's champion. The rest would be returned to the moment of their respective deaths.</p><p>Jurassic World and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom scribe Derek Connolly will tackle the script for Eternal Champions.

His upcoming projects include director Wes Ball's Legend of Zelda movie for Sony, and the G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover movie starring Chris Hemsworth.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog producer Toru Nakahara will produce Eternal Champions for Sega, while David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger will serve as producers on behalf of Skydance.

                <p>From Silent Hill and System Shock to Ant Attack and Resident Evil, we've seen a wealth of nightmare-inducing horror games released over the past several decades. The history of these titles is often filled with surprising development stories, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ants-Zombies-Decades-Video-Horror/dp/1838019162?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">From Ants to Zombies: Six Decades of Video Game Horror</a> serves as a comprehensive resting place for all these terrifying tales.

                <p>It's our favorite time of the year and not <em>just</em> because temperatures are finally starting to cool down. It's Gamecom time, folks!</p><p>If the dozens of fantastic games launching over the course of the next few months weren't enough to look forward to, brace yourselves for a whole lot of announcements, reveals, and deep dives courtesy of the Germany-based video game trade show. In this episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss what games they are most excited to see on the show floor, as well as what they suspect Opening Night Live has in store for us. From <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, to more niche titles like the aptly named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun/" data-ref-id="5000-567899">Squirrel With A Gun</a>, there's a lot to chat about and even more to get excited for. Here's a quick overview of the content you can expect to see from GameSpot in the coming weeks, as well as plenty of titles to add to your ever-growing "want to play" list.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdOO0LQgKIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PdOO0LQgKIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

We’re certain there’s something here for you.</p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Steam<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Solve an old-fashioned mystery</p><p>A few weeks ago, I mentioned how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-star-wars-final-fantasy-hinterberg-1851612307/slides/5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-star-wars-final-fantasy-hinterberg-1851612307/slides/5">I was captivated by <em>Unavowed</em></a></span>, a point-and-click adventure from the folks at Wadjet Eye. Well, I’ve finished that one (it was great) just in time for a brand-new entry in the genre to come along. And while Wadjet Eye’s output is most reminiscent of ‘90s adventure games that offered full voice acting and elegant drag-and-drop interfaces, this new game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a></span><em> </em>from designer Julia Minamata, is influenced by an earlier era of adventures, ones that ran in EGA and had you typing in what you wanted your character to do. I can’t wait to explore its mysteries.</p><p><em>The Crimson Diamond </em>is perhaps most reminiscent of Sierra adventures, especially the Clara Bow games which saw their plucky heroine tossed into murder mysteries during the roaring ‘20s. It<em> </em>casts you as Nancy Maple, a young woman investigating the discovery of an unusually large and valuable diamond in a town in northern Ontario, Canada. It’s clear from the trailer that her investigations will find her encountering people with motives of their own, some of them sinister, and land her in no small amount of peril. Sign me up!</p><p>People often talk about the evolution of adventure games from text parsers to purely graphical interfaces as a net good, as if text parsers were just a crutch, a relic from the genre’s early days that we no longer needed, but I’ve always thought of them as two fundamentally different approaches, each with their own strengths. I think there are ways in which the presence of a text parser can encourage creative thinking that a purely graphics-based interface doesn’t always allow for, and in addition to digging into the plot of <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, I’m eager to see how it uses this design element that so rarely gets employed in modern games. All in all, it sounds like a perfect fit for a cozy weekend. —<strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC (early access)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>See if this <em>Stardew Valley </em>competitor has got chops</p><p>I keep hearing about this freaking game, so I think it’s time I just play it. I’m not really one to play a farming game—having bounced off of <em>Stardew Valley </em>a number of times despite enjoying myself—but maybe <em>Fields of Mistria</em> will be the one that makes me stick with the genre. I think if it manages that feat, it’ll be because of the strength of its gameplay and art style. I’ve grown a bit tired of the pixelated look of games like <em>Stardew</em>, which certainly hasn’t helped its case, but I also never really loved the loop of it either. It isn’t that it feels bad, but rather that it feels uneven. Farming appropriately feels like busywork, and I’ve been hooked by its fishing mini-game, but whenever I had to go into the mines to dig and get into some combat, it felt shallow.</p><p>That doesn’t appear to be the case for <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, which looks to boast more in the way of tailored dungeons and involved combat mechanics. Aesthetically and mechanically, it seems way closer to a classic <em>Zelda </em>title, and that’s doing a lot to muster excitement from me. Now, if I can just make it to the point where the daily rhythm of activities feels like second nature, I might just find the first cozy farming game outside of <em>Animal Crossing </em>to make a lasting impression. —<strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Steam<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Write another story</p><p>When we put together these Kotaku Weekend Guides, typically I try to write something I’m currently playing or have at least played recently. This time, I went looking through my Steam library for a game to recommend, and Worldwalker Games’ <em>Wildermyth</em> caught my eye. The tactics RPG was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wildermyth-s-incredible-dynamic-storytelling-is-giving-1847593466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wildermyth-s-incredible-dynamic-storytelling-is-giving-1847593466">one of the best games to come out in 2021</a></span>. It lets you create a party of heroes and play through branching campaigns, all with excellent writing and interesting spins on fantasy combat mechanics. I only played through one campaign in 2021, but I have a lot of fond memories of playing as my mage Kenjamin Shepardson and using the magic system that’s more akin to an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> bending than your usual spellcasting system, requiring you to manipulate the elements in the environment. Those made each battle compelling, but the attachment I had to my custom party made the stakes feel incredibly high. <em>Wildermyth</em>’s storytelling is its greatest strength, and its ability to let you nudge the story in drastically different directions while building your party’s relationships is still head and shoulders above games with 10 times the budget. It’s finally coming to consoles on October 22, but the PC version is exceptional and well worth your time. —<strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC <br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Make it to September</p><p>I like Atlus RPGs in general and enjoy the <em>Persona</em> games in particular. I began with <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> on Vita, played a bit of <em>Persona 2: Innocent Sin</em> on the PSP, and poured about 20 hours into <em>Persona 5</em> on the PS4. They’re all great games and I liked them just fine, but none pulled me in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">like <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> has</a></span>. I’d be lying if I said I knew exactly why that is. </p><p>Maybe it’s the modern graphics and old-school design sensibility hitting a sweet spot in my nostalgia, like I’m experiencing a lost game from the late aughts that I always wanted to play but never got to. Or it could be that the more melancholy, blue-tinted mashup of chill vibes and menacing macabre undertones is more my style than the other <em>Persona</em> games. I even find grinding the endless procedural dungeons oddly satisfying, giving me a modicum of exploration, progression, and jazzy combat without making me feel like a mouse being led through a laborious maze in search of an old bit of moldy cheese.</p><p>I can sit down at the end of a long day, turn the lights off, get in, vibe out, and then cut loose after just a few days have passed on the social calendar. It helps that the soundtrack is top notch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486">The epilogue DLC is out in just a month</a></span>. I probably won’t be done in time, which is fine. I’m in no rush.

However, my long-suffering Jets fandom tends to keep me almost as loyal to <em>Madden</em> as I am to Gang Green itself. Within my first few days of playing last year’s <em>Madden 24</em>, I logged 29 hours almost exclusively in Franchise mode turning the Jets into Super Bowl champs, Robert Saleh into Coach of the Year, and running back Breece Hall into league MVP and the record-holder for most touchdowns in a single season—the latter of which was accomplished mostly because I suck at passing and can’t read defenses beyond the line of scrimmage.</p><p>In honor of my quarterback hopefully completing a full season IRL after suffering a catastrophic injury in Week 1 last year, I’ll be spending the next few days trying to improve my passing so Aaron Rodgers can retire an MVP and my Jets can be back-to-back Super Bowl champs. What are video games for if not opportunities to live out your wildest (and most improbable) fantasies? —<strong>Austin Williams</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
