			<p>Captain Blood is a name that conjures up nostalgic memories for older gamers, the title being first used for a critically acclaimed Amiga game featuring a galactic storyline. That’s not the Captain Blood that’s going under the microscope today, though this is still a game with its own fascinating history. Originally planned for release in 2010, the game had already been affected by delays and a shift from the original Xbox to the 360, but was cancelled due to legal issues and the team disbanding. Jump ahead a decade and a full build was leaked online to spark a small amount of interest, and no, in the grand old year of 2025, Captain Peter Blood is set to finally ship out, sail the seas and bring piratical justice to the Spanish on behalf of good old Blighty. Does that tortured history mean that this is a treasure being brought to the light or is it a dodgy mug of grog that’ll see you heaving over the side of the boat?</p>
<p><iframe title="CAPTAIN BLOOD RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, Captain Blood looks its age. It is presented in a higher resolution than would originally have been possible, but the textures and character models have a chunkiness that scream of the mid-2000s. Personally I really dig that as it’s an artstyle that has been somewhat lost to time – most nostalgic aesthetics go back to an earlier date. It reminded me a lot of the Toby Gard cult classic Galleon, but with a PS2-era God of War makeover. This is very much an old school beat ’em up with hundreds of cannon fodder enemies and a vast amount of blood to be spilled.</p>


<p>I was impressed by the music here, with many of the background tunes having just enough of a Hans Zimmer Pirates of the Caribbean vibe to feel perfectly suited whilst clearly being legally distinct. The same praise can’t be granted to the voice acting, however. Not because it’s bad per se, but because the mix is bloody awful and you’ll mostly miss out on whatever is being said and have to rely on subtitles instead. This is ironically a problem that mostly affects modern film and TV, so it’s not something that can be put down to the nostalgic presentation.</p>


<p>Despite his ominous moniker, Captain Peter Blood is very much the scoundrel hero in this story. Taking place in the 17th century during the various skirmishes and sea battles over control of the Caribbean, the narrative is surprisingly down to earth and lacking the kind of supernatural aspects I was expecting after years of Disney’s takes on the setting. The enemies are made up of dastardly pirates and the even more despicable Spanish (within the game of course) with a limited range of enemy types and several boss battles. Blood is happy to serve the orders of the British, but is more concerned with riches than patriotism.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, the majority of the action is a very standard early God of War clone with far more simple mechanics and little in the way of subtlety and sophistication. Ironically this makes it stand out far more nowadays than it would have if it was released when originally planned since this is a genre that has fallen out of fashion – especially considering the direction Kratos himself has taken in recent years. While clearly a fully 3D title, the combat has a lot in common with traditional lane-based beat ’em ups and button mashing combos are the order of the day.</p>

<p>The vast majority of your fighting will take place with your trusty cutlass, but secondary weapons can be picked up and used for a limited time, with the two-handed sword being great for clearing out groups of enemies. There are some oddities here, though, with one weapon labelled a hatchet but clearly being a large sword. You can even find the odd musket to give you a ranged approach alongside your normal pistol – a rechargeable gun that is mostly used to stagger enemies and interrupt their attacks.</p>
<p>There are a decent amount of combos to unlock with the gold you’ll find along your journey but I found that a couple of these were far more useful than others – especially ones that have an unblockable component so much of the game involved spamming the same two or three attacks. There was even a trophy to unlock for only using one combo for a whole level which seemed as if the developers knew this was a valid approach. Despite the effectiveness of such combos, it is far too easy to get stunlocked and killed by mobs of enemies and I died more to this than the boss battles. There are several ship battle sections which see you manning cannons to sink your foes whilst fighting off any that board your vessel. These are fine but don’t add much other than variety.</p>

<p>Bosses are often puzzles to be solved, with environmental aspects needing to be considered and a couple being mostly QTE sequences – did you forget this was a mid-2000s game? These sequences are fine but definitely feel like an aspect that add little to the experience. Another thing that hasn’t aged gracefully is the representation of women here. There are a grand total of two female characters, one being a stereotypical damsel in distress and the other a femme fatale (the whole spectrum of femininity in games of this era) but both are dressed in skimpy outfits and have built in buoyancy aids. This actually makes Disney seem progressive in comparison!</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Captain Blood is an odd release as it feels like a relic of its original release context. This does leave it being a nostalgic experience for those old enough to remember this era of games, but there isn’t much that isn’t done much better by its influences. Releasing decades later actually does it a favour as it feels very different to the expansive open world experiences that dominate modern gaming. As a curiosity it makes for an interesting time but it mostly confirms why such games belong in the past. Not so much buried treasure, but it's certainly better than walking the plank.	</p></div>

		<p>One of the most beloved, if slightly odd, franchises from the Sega Megadrive era is going to return with Ecco the Dolphin creator, Ed Annunziata, heading up a team that will remaster the first two games and create a third title.</p>
<p>An 8,500 hour countdown started on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eccothedolphin.com</a>, that is equivalent to&nbsp; almost a year so we will be getting the full reveal, or perhaps even the games, at the end of April 2026.</p>


<p>“Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games,” Annunziata <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">says.</a> “Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities. Stay tuned to eccothedolphin.com.”</p>
<p>Annunziata’s involvement may surprise some as he sued Sega for ownership rights of the Ecco IP when he tried to make a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/26/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-kickstarting-the-big-blue/">sequel via Kickstarter</a>.&nbsp; A settlement was reached, but the details were never revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ecco the Dolphin - Mega Drive - Gameplay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnHg210DDnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original game had you playing as Ecco as he swam through the seas and travels to the Arctic Ocean where he meets a whale called Big Blue. Its here things start to get a bit odd as Ecco then has to collect orbs of power from Atlantis to charge up Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth.&nbsp; The dolphin then uses a time travel machine to nip back to meet some dinosaurs, learns to talk to a Pteranodon, then zips through a portal in to outer space where he fights and alien queen. Not THE Alien Queen, but that is a movie I want to see, Ripley the Dolphin!</p>

<p>A sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time was released, and Ecco games continued to be made in later years, but these were for educational porpoises.</p>
<p>The first two games were also ported to numerous system and could be played as part of the Sega Genesis Collection on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has addressed the debate around rising game prices, and discussed the "impossible equation" of inflation and expensive development costs.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by some fans for the increased price of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, with launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> costing £75/$80 - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">Nintendo has called an example of "variable pricing"</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">some new first-party Xbox games will rise to $80 beginning later this year</a>. Reports have also suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">the forthcoming GTA 6 could cost as much as £80/$100</a>. </p>
<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida gave his view on the current situation.</p>

<p>"I think it was going to happen sooner or later, maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually," he said. "We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."</p>
<p>Yoshida stated the "heart of the matter lies in production costs", as nowadays games are "more technologically demanding than ever before".</p>
<p>He suggests that the "proliferation of remasters and remakes" is a way for the industry to diversify, with these projects being "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits that ultimately help finance new games".</p>
<p>"So I don't know if Rockstar will jump at the chance to set the price of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> at €90 or more, to speak with your currency, but the situation is this," said Yoshida. "And we could even add subscription platforms and games as a service, which, while providing huge revenues in their own right, also help to finance AAA down the line."</p>
<p>He then pointed to the recent release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> from French studio Sandfall Interactive as an example of AA success. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">hit a million sales within three days</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">praised by French President Macron</a>.</p>
<p>"In any case, a balance must be found between production costs and game prices," said Yoshida. "GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but if you take the example of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the game is just as phenomenal visually, despite the fact that the team only has around thirty people. This is one of the ways forward, I think, because you can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p>
<p>One potential way of reducing costs is using AI, which Yoshida discussed elsewhere in the interview. He believes AI can be used "creatively to improve games" but stated "AI are tools, not ends in themselves".</p>
<p>"AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features," he said. "We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality.</p>
<p>"Designers and developers therefore need to master these new generative tools. It's just a matter of time, as long as we keep human artists at the heart of the project. Generative AI and its other emanations can and should be used to speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games, especially for small studios that don't have the manpower. This could also help to lower game production costs, making the video game economy more viable – as long as it doesn't lead to redundancies, of course."</p>
<p>As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, he's most looking forward to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Duskbloods from FromSoftware</a>. "I'm curious to see what FromSoftware will do with a Switch exclusive on a technical level, and it's always interesting to see what they come up with, especially after Elden Ring," he said.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last year</a>, he's been particularly vocal with his views on the industry: he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">Nintendo is losing its identity</a> following the Switch 2 reveal, he admitted to playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Naughty Dog's ill-fate The Last of Us Online</a>, and claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">NieR: Automata revived the Japanese games industry</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is a big game with a lot of side characters and you can traverse its world relatively freely - so freely that, 40 hours since you last saw someone, it can often be difficult to remember who they were, and why they wanted you to go kill that dude. 
</p>
<p>
Well, today's 1.0.4 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows addresses this by adding in Codex entries for the game's main cast of characters, sidekicks, antagonists and supporting antagonists, which will unlock as you meet them.
</p>
<p>
It's something that previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> had previously but which Shadows eschewed, keeping its Codex more for historical and cultural details. Now it's back, following feedback from fans.

<p>
Today's Assassin's Creed Shadows update is set to go live at 2pm UK time (10am Eastern, 7am Pacific) and weigh in at around 4.6GB on PS5, 8.5GB on Steam or 20GB on Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, today also brings the first of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Shadows' free post-launch story missions that add more moments with some of the game's secondary characters</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The Works of Luis Frois centres on Yasuke's Jesuit friend who you meet a couple of times during Shadows' existing runtime. Today's new quest can be played by either Yasuke or Naoe, and also features Lady Satoko. Who is she? Well, you can now go remind yourself in the Codex.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's post-launch roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to offer another of these free story quests on a monthly basis - similar to the Lost Tales of Greece offered for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> back in the day. Shadows' first paid expansion, meanwhile, will launch later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the changes in today's patch are mostly minor bug fixes, though it's interesting to see Ubisoft further tweak the ability for environmental destruction around religious buildings in the game. "All props near an altar or a religion building will now be static, preventing any destruction," Ubisoft notes, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">previously locking down larger items at these in-game sites</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a website leak suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pegi-website-leak-suggests-assassins-creed-shadows-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Assassin's Creed Shadows would launch on Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Last week, Eurogamer published an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/working-in-the-shadows-how-an-assassins-creed-researcher-braved-the-backlash">interview with a historical researcher who worked on Assassin's Creed Shadows and braved the game's cultural backlash</a>.

<p>Spindlejack "puts players into the seat of a courier on the space station Far Spindle, a familiar location from Starward Vector. Players will navigate the station, earn Cryo, build their reputation, make their mark on the courier scene, and try to survive in a hostile system".</p>
<p>As shared by Jump Over The Age, the free tabletop game mirrors "the hard decisions and emergent storytelling that fans have come to know and love from the series". If that all sounds like your thing, <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">you can download Spindlejack here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing a new Citizen Sleeper tabletop game, the developer has also shared some interesting Citizen Sleeper-related stats. Since the series debut in 2022, the games have welcomed over two million players.</p>
<p>26 percent of the first game's players joined a commune, while 19 percent made bootleg booze from mushrooms (actually assumed this would be higher). Six percent went on to become a part of the fungal network and 1.5 percent left Lem and Mina waiting on the dock as they instead set off for a new life alone. To quote Jump Over The Age, "you monsters".</p>
<p>As for the second game in the series, 29 percent of Starward Vector players adopted a stray cat. Again, I really assumed this would be higher. 35 percent of the sequel's players got lucky with a glitched dice, 18 percent allowed Surya to turn their ship  into a flying billboard and 1.5 percent managed to complete the game on dangerous difficulty. "You heroes," says the Citizen Sleeper team. Can confirm, I am absolutely not part of that 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the developer has said it will be adding French, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese localisation to Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector later this year.</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">very positive reviews</a> on its release, and was nominated for a number of BAFTAs. Its sequel similarly received positive reviews, with our Bertie calling it "terrific".</p>
<p>"With a new found sense of tension, and showpiece Contract missions, Citizen Sleeper is transformed. This follow-up has improved the RPG formula in every way," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-review">Eurogamer's Citizen Sleeper 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In late April, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release date of Ghost of Yōtei. The sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima will be released on October 2, 2025, for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that it's one of the most anticipated games of the year. After all, its predecessor was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excellent action/adventure game</a> that also set a new sales record for PlayStation 4's first-party debut. The superb reception pushed Sony to fast-track not only a sequel but also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie adaptation</a> that will be directed by John Wick's Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Can Ghost of Yōtei meet&nbsp;<span>fans' lofty expectations, though?&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to the French website PlayStation Inside</a>, former head of PlayStation Studios Shuhei Yoshida revealed that he played the game, and fans can be assured that </span>it'll be even better than the first installment.</p>
<p><em>In the case of Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch worked extensively with a Japanese producer at SIE, as well as colleagues at Japan Studio. This was a great help to the studio because the developers could show them their ideas and these Japanese people would tell them internally whether or not they were respectful of Japan and correct. The teams also visited Tsushima Island and made a real effort to immerse themselves in its history and traditions. They managed to capture the island’s unique atmosphere, which can be felt in the game, for example in the wind system, and I think that’s why it’s so successful. The game has even boosted tourism on Tsushima Island, which says a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>So, if you want to sell well in Japan, especially when you’re making a game about Japan, it’s important to have a development process that seeks to understand the country throughout. Ghost of Tsushima felt incredible to play, and having played Ghost of Yotei at several stages of its development, I can assure you that it will be even better and that Sucker Punch has done it again!</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch date news, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> new details about this new game. The developers said this is their biggest world with the greatest amount of player freedom. The campaign where protagonist Atsu seeks her revenge will be non-linear, meaning that players can take on the Yōtei Six (who killed Atsu's family) in any order.</p>

</ul>
<h2>That's your lot</h2>
<p>Okay, I'm done here. As ever, let us know in the comments if there's anything happening this week that we've missed, but you've got your swivelly little eyes on. The Maw is, at least, placated.

I'll, uh, be right back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-the-way-reviving-the-mega-drive-icon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in development, alongside remasters of the original two Mega Drive games.</p>
<p>The new game will have "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" and has been revealed alongside a new countdown on the <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">game's website</a>. It's unclear if this is counting to a final release date or further news, but either way it's currently 8510 hours away - that's 354 days and 14 hours from now, which points to 25th April 2026.</p>
<p>News of a new entry was confirmed by series creator Ed Annunziata in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a>, as part of a celebration of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Annunziata and the entire original team are behind both the remasters and the new project.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin was first released in 1992 for the Mega Drive and was followed by a sequel, The Tides of Time, in 1994.</p>
<p>Both games are 2D side-scrollers focused on the titular Ecco, who explores vibrant ocean environments with his sonar abilities. I still have my copy of the first game from when I was a kid: its shimmering oceans are gorgeous, but the puzzle gameplay gets very hard very quickly - not to mention its incredibly weird, alien story.</p>
<p>It's unknown yet if the new game will be 2D or 3D, but the original games were followed by the 3D Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, though Annunziata wasn't involved with this one.</p>
<p>That game is not as well regarded and its proposed sequel was cancelled due to declining sales of the Dreamcast. Annunziata attempted to raise a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-launches-kickstarter-for-spiritual-successor-the-big-blue">Kickstarter for a spiritual successor back in 2013</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Speaking to Xbox Wire, Annunziata discussed the role of the gaming community in raising awareness about global issues.</p>
<p>"I feel gamers possess a higher than average IQ than the average human," he said. "Not only because they are frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology, but they are highly socially connected as well. Like the ocean, a gaming community is an ecosystem – games like Ecco can and should be a conduit to join these realms.</p>
<p>"I have high expectations of gamers for all the above-stated reasons. But there is something else gamers possess that can make the difference, and that is love. A universal love of games and gaming gives us all something we all share, when games like Ecco reach the hearts of gaming communities, that love can really make things happen in the real world."</p>
<p>Back in January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freshly-filed-sega-trademarks-hint-at-the-return-of-another-classic-series-25-years-after-its-last-entry">Sega filed a new trademark for Ecco the Dolphin</a>, hinting a new project was on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I once got in a heated debate with Graham over whether the chest-high walls in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series could accurately be called 'massive'. The Gears men are massive, I argued. So it stands to reason that any wall that could provide adequate bullet cover to a massive man must itself be a massive wall. No, said Graham. They're famously normal size walls, hence why the massive men have to squat down like they've just had a bowling ball lobbed at their kidneys. Well, we can finally examine the true scale of these walls - in 4K no less - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears Of War: Reloaded</a>. A "faithfully remastered" version of the 2006 large man <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>, coming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/">to Steam on August 26th</a> this year.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a trailer so enjoy this extremely old one and just imagine it looks nicer. Bit nicer. Little bit nicer. That's it, now you're thinking like a customer!</p>

<p>The announcement was announced by the announcement professionals at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">Xbox Wire</a>. It'll be $40 to buy, and also available on that game subscription service you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections"> may or may not want to support right now</a>. The blog mentions "split screen" although doesn't use the words "local co-op" specifically. Reloaded has "the full breadth of content from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>", itself a remaster with some added bonuses, namely the five extra chapters previously exclusive to the original Windows release. Here are some Gamer Stats for you, gamer:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>My claim to fame is that I'm one of the seven people in the world that had played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Switch_(video_game)#Legacy">Kill Switch</a> prior to the original Gears. That's the 2003 PS2 game that effectively invented the contemporary cover shooter, complete with blindfire. If anything needed a modern remaster, that feels like the far more important project to me, essential piece of gaming history that it is. It's <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/kill-switch-e3s">currently available as abandonware</a> if you're curious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another one of Microsoft's key franchises will arrive on PlayStation this year, via a revamped edition of the original Gears of War game.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded's announcement comes almost 20 years since the series first made its Xbox debut.</p>
<p>This modernised version of the original Gears of War will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August. It will cost $40, and also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief. It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studios promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware", Microsoft has said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">laid out in an Xbox post</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded players can expect the following enhancements on the game's release this summer:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Reloaded will also boast some platform specific features, and support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

<p>Those who already own the digital version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> will receive a free upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded, but only if they purchased the game prior to this announcement. So, if you decide to plump for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox now, you will not be eligible for that free upgrade when Reloaded releases.</p>
<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we're reflecting on what this franchise means. It's about the stories we've told, the friendships we've built, and the unforgettable moments we've shared together," The Coalition studio head Mike Crump said yesterday. </p>
<p>"With Gears of War: Reloaded, we're opening that door to more players than ever."</p>

Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. </p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/compulsion-games-boss-says-internal-xbox-studios-aren-t-facing-generative-ai-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Game Developer</a> during the recent Gamescom LATAM, Compulsion Games founder and studio head Guillaume Provost revealed that Microsoft is not forcing its usage on Xbox Game Studios.</p>
<p><em>I can absolutely guarantee that generative AI usage is not mandated. You're talking to the studio that literally builds shit by hand. In the DNA of the studio that we have, we're very craft oriented. We're very art oriented. Just based on the types of games that we make, I would say we are probably not the studio that will use AI the most, and I don't think that bothers anything at Microsoft. The DNA of our studio is to handcraft things and to make them feel handcrafted, and that involves a lot of manual labor.</em></p>
<p>Provost later admitted that generative AI could still prove useful even for Compulsion's approach to development.</p>
<p><em>I think there are a lot of cases where it could be helpful in pre-production for us to do things like spitting out storyboards for us to see whether it makes sense or not— not really stuff that we use in production, but stuff that we want to accelerate.</em></p>
<p>Compulsion Games recently released the&nbsp;<span>single-player action/adventure game South of Midnight. In another interview&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/south-midnight-sales-milestone-1-million-players-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game Rant</a>, Provost confirmed that the game had already reached over a million players. Granted, its availability on the Microsoft owned subscription service Game Pass certainly helped a great deal</span>. However, it's still a fairly important milestone for the Montreal-based developer previously known for Contrast and We Happy Few.</p>
<p>South of Midnight received a 7/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by David Carcasole:</p>
<p><em>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roaring-kitty-is-apparently-back-to-his-gamestop-pumping-ways/">GameStop</a> has sold its Canadian branch, GameStop Canada, to French-Canadian entrepreneur and McFarlane Toys co-owner Stephan Tetrault, who has also confirmed that the retailer will re-launch as Electronics Boutique Canada Inc., or EB Games Canada.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1891884823465103698">announced back in February</a> that he was looking to sell the Canadian division of the company, telling interested parties to email GameStop's mergers and acquisitions division, saying "<em>High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stephan-tetrault-acquires-gamestop-canada-302446106.html">press release</a> regarding the acquisition, Tetrault says, "<em>This isn't just a business decision - it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved. We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gamestop-selling-canadian-assets-ceo-wokeness-dei-1.7462542">The Canadian Press</a> put the number of Canadian GameStop stores at 203, though that was before GameStop <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/26/gamestop-close-significant-number-locations-report/">confirmed it would be shutting down</a> more of its locations worldwide, Canada included. The press release for today's acquisition puts the current number at "<em>over 185</em>" locations.</p>
<p>"<em>We want EB Games Canada to be more than a store,</em>" adds GameStop Canada president Jim Tyo. "<em>We want it to be the hub for gaming and fandom culture across Canada. This is about passion, and that's what's going to drive every decision we make</em>."</p>
<p>The transition from GameStop Canada to EB Games Canada will begin across the country in the coming months, including new store signage, a new website, and new branding across all social platforms. Canadians will surely have whiplash over the change since many remember that it wasn't too long ago that <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8066111/gamestop-eb-games-canada-rebrand/">GameStop sunsetted&nbsp;the EB Games branding in Canada</a>, with every EB Games becoming a GameStop.</p>
<p>Gamers have been lamenting the poor practices that GameStop perpetuates and how the stores have begun to sell more toys and Pop Funkos than games. It'll be interesting to see how Tetrault tries to turn things around, and if he can bring more gamers back to the retail store after many have turned their backs on buying from GameStop for years.</p>

It looks like Christopher McQuarrie, who directed <em>Rogue Nation</em> and <em>Fallout</em> as well, had entire portions of the sub’s interior recreated for the scenes. Hopefully, in addition to whatever new ways Cruise finds to make his insurance agents squirm, the sequence doesn’t lean on post-production special effects to make an impact. </p><p>This isn’t <em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s first major water stunt. <em>Rogue Nation</em> saw Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold his breath for 6 minutes</a></span> in a scene where his character, Ethan Hunt, had to unlock a hatch while swirling around a giant server-cooling tank. And that scene only came about after Cruise filmed <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, for which McQuarrie helped write the script, which ends with his character diving underwater beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris to kill a giant alien.</p><p><em>The Final Reckoning </em>hits theaters in just a few weeks on May 23, and brings with it a lot of questions beyond whether Cruise and the franchise still have new tricks up their sleeves. For one, there’s the question of how the movie will make good on the many callbacks to earlier entries in the franchise teased in the trailers, and what it will tell us about how Hunt came to join the IMF in the first place, a plot thread hinted at in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>. The biggest question of all, though, is whether this will be Cruise’s last<em> Mission: Impossible</em> movie. Given his obsession with movies, Hollywood, and his own legacy at the box office, I somehow doubt it. At least as long as<em> Final Reckoning </em>does better than its predecessor. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, weird stuff. The game got a sequel in 1994, which (spoilers) ended with Ecco getting access to a time machine and leaving for some unknown point in history. While the games were odd, they had a lot of fans and now the creator behind them, Ed Annunziata, has shared that remasters of those games are on the way, along with a new sequel. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a May 5 interview with Xbox</a></span>, Annunziata talked about his inspiration for creating Ecco and then gave a small tease for the future of the franchise, telling fans to “stay tuned” and further explaining: “Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original <em>Ecco the Dolphin </em>and <em>Tides of Time</em> games.

You might be expecting a teaser or perhaps a bit more info about these upcoming remasters and the next game in the <em>Ecco</em> series. Well,  there’s nothing like that on the site. Instead, if you head over there you’ll be greeted by a countdown clock that won’t hit 0 for another 8,528 hours or about 355 days, also known as basically a full year. </p><p>I’ve seen video game marketing countdown clocks before, but usually they’re for a week or two at the most. More often it’s just for a few days. The idea of doing a one-year countdown clock for remasters of <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> is wild. I mean, I guess it worked because you’re reading a blog about the countdown clock and the remasters right now. But I’m not sure this fanbase has the energy to be excited for a year. Anyway, hopefully I’ll be back in 350 days or so to share  a cool trailer for <em>Ecco The Dolphin Remastered</em>. See you then! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>

Bungie’s extraction shooter didn’t really win me over, but each time I booted it up I was greeted by a PlayStation Studios logo, as the former <em>Halo </em>maker is now owned by PlayStation. This was odd to see on my Xbox, but it didn’t stand out too much. But <em>Gears of War </em>on PlayStation is so bizarre. It’s one of Xbox’s big three:<em> Forza, Halo, Gears</em>. Now only one of them remains truly Xbox only. </p><p><em>Gears </em>on PS5 is the kind of weird idea that, a decade ago or more, you’d hear someone suggest and you’d laugh at. Like some random, clueless analyst pondering when Mario will arrive on Xbox. Never gonna happen dude, don’t you know anything? I remember being a younger lad and being one of the few people at my middle school to own an Xbox. They all had PlayStation 3s. They all were jealous of <em>Gears of War</em>. Some of them would tell me that <em>Gears </em>was coming to PS3 one day. And <em>Halo</em>. I’d shake my head. I knew better. I read all the gaming magazines of the day. I scrolled through gaming forums and consumed <em>GameSpot </em>articles. They were wrong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357"><em>Gears of War</em> would <em><strong>never </strong></em>be on a PlayStation console</a></span>. Well, turns out they were right, they were just about 18 years ahead of the schedule.</p><p> So while I understand the business reasons for <em>Gears </em>coming to PlayStation and I’ve seen plenty of other Xbox-published games arrive on non-Xbox consoles, it’s all still very weird for me to watch. I’ll probably have to sit down when I see the news of <em>Halo </em>on PS5. At least more people will now have access to more games. That’s cool, even if younger me would never have believed any of this was possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, due to some changes HBO has made to the story of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>in adapting it for television, long-time fans think one character might have successfully evaded the chopping block here after meeting a gruesome end in the game. At least, they’re hoping so.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shimmer is Ellie’s horse in <em>The Last of Us</em>, both in the show and in <em>Part II </em>of the game. The trusty steed helps get our heroine from the small town of Jackson to the warzone of Seattle. However, in one of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s most shocking moments, while on horseback the player is forced to accidentally trigger an explosive barricade set up by the W.L.F. A member of the militia is kind enough to put her out of her misery after the blast, but then captures Ellie for questioning. It’s a brutal scene, and it’s even worse when you don’t know it’s coming.</p><p>As such, people watching the <em>Last of Us </em>show after playing the game have been bracing themselves for this week’s episode, as this would have been the one in which Shimmer kicked the bucket in a more faithful retelling. However, as of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062">episode four</a></span>, Shimmer is just vibing in an abandoned record shop, presumably safe from any landmines, infected, or any other danger. Homegirl is living her best life free of worry. So is Shimmer safe from the horrors of Ellie’s revenge tour? A lot can happen in the three episodes left of the season, but fans are crossing all their fingers and toes.</p><p>It’s probably not gonna undo the collective trauma of watching Pedro Pascal get murdered via golf club, but hey, we take the wins where we can get them. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> was poised to be 2025's biggest and best-selling game, but it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed to 2026</a>. With GTA 6 no longer coming this year, 2025 may become "the year of Nintendo" thanks to the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> in June and the release of high-profile games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>. That's the opinion of analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analysts-react-to-gta-6-delay-2025-will-clearly-be-the-year-of-nintendo-now-and-the-delay-isnt-a-stumble-its-rockstar-doing-what-it-always-does/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that publishers who were planning to release their new games in the second half of 2025 but hadn't confirmed a date yet are now "probably breathing a sigh of relief now."</p><p>Sony also benefits, Toto said, referring to its marquee title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost of Yotei</a> now being able to release "in peace." Even Microsoft may benefit by launching its new Xbox handheld device into a market where people aren't otherwise occupied playing GTA 6, Toto said.</p><p>"2025 will clearly be the year of Nintendo now," Toto explained.</p><p>Joost van Dreunen, for his part, said GTA 6's delay means that big publishers like EA, Ubisoft, and Sony now have a better chance of "commanding attention during a window that would have otherwise been swallowed whole. It's an opportunity."</p><p>However, van Dreunen acknowledged that had GTA 6 launched on time in Fall 2025, it could have created a "cultural moment" that may have drawn back lapsed gamers who might end up buying other games, too. This could have benefited many games, he said.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-could-lock-limited-time-modes-behind-battle-pass-report/1100-6531311/" data-ref-id="1100-6531311">new Call of Duty game is expected to come out this year</a>, too, and now it won't have to compete with GTA 6. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a>, too, is possibly going to release this year.</p><p>As for GTA 6, it's officially set for release on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Naturally, it's expected to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">gigantic success when it releases. </a></p>
