While on its face an epic space opera about humanity confronting cosmic evil in a post-apocalyptic future, Bungie’s sci-fi  shooter is also a <em>Pokémon</em>-style collectathon where instead of cute magical creatures, players capture rare, ornate, and powerful guns. The game’s latest “weightgate” controversy is a strangely compelling conspiracy theory proposing that certain ideal weapon variants are dropping at much lower rates than junk ones, and it’s reigniting old debates about <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot system and whether it’s actually fun or not.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Most weapons you can get in the game drop with two random perks which do everything from increase reload speed to more interesting stuff like add elemental explosions to precision hits. </p><p>Some perk combinations are considered much, much better than others based on their synergy with the weapon’s underlying stats and the broader meta governing  character builds at any given point in time. These combinations are called god rolls and they decide whether the Legendary drop you just found is worth keeping or junk that should be immediately destroyed. In theory, perk combinations should be completely random, providing an equal chance of getting a god roll as any other possible permutation. But a new conspiracy says that’s not actually how it works, and players think they have the math to prove it. </p><p>At the heart of this scandal, which <em>Destiny </em>aficionado Paul Tassi at<em> Forbes </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling potentially the biggest in the game’s history</a></span>, is a new grenade launcher called VS Chill Inhibitor. It was just added to the game in <em>Episode: Revenant</em>, the second content update since <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion in June, as one of the legendary drops in the new Vesper’s Host dungeon. The god roll perks are Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch, which reload the weapon from reserves and increase damage, respectively. Both are activated by doing damage with other weapons, making it an easy to use but highly effective threat. </p><p>But players have been farming the first encounter in the Vesper’s Host dungeon ad nauseum and struggling to score this particular god roll more than seemingly any other in recent memory. Theories immediately emerged shortly after the dungeon went live that there must be some sort of bug on Bungie’s end that is unintentionally making the god roll for VS Chill Inhibitor shockingly rare. One player’s data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing this hypothesis</a></span> blew up over the weekend, so much so that Bungie decided to respond directly. </p><p>“Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this,” the <em>Destiny</em> team Twitter account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on October 21</a></span>. “There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in <em>Destiny 2</em>.  We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that’s a different system.” It seemed like an open-and-shut case, with the denial leaving no wiggle room for alternate interpretations or theories. Days later, however, players have continued running the numbers and are finding Bungie’s refutation even harder to believe. </p><p>Here’s the crux of the conspiracy as its taken shape this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as articulated by T1Vendetta</a></span>. It’s not that Bungie is intentionally making the most desirable god rolls for weapons harder to get than other perk combinations, but rather that its RNG code is randomly favoring some combinations over others. Specifically, there’s an idea that perks which are listed further away from one another in the tables for Bungie’s API for <em>Destiny 2</em> are less likely to appear together, while those closer in proximity drop together much more frequently. So while these disparities are actually happening all the time, players only notice them when a weapon’s god roll happens to combine two perks that are unusually far away from one another in the table. </p><p>An analysis by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Skarrow9</a></span> walks players through the theory in more detail and showcases anecdotal player data and crowdsourced research to back it up. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There’s a growing suspicion in the community</a></span> that this is actually due to a bug dating back to the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>, as evidenced by the unusual perk distribution drop rates for a grenade launcher reissued in that expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called Truthteller</a></span>. “At this point, it would seem there’s no malice being directed at or from Bungie in this, but the data is there,” wrote a player on the subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in one of the many popular threads</a></span> discussing the issue. “Whether it’s a bug or issue with how perks are generated, we just want answers or further investigation.”</p><p>There are already some players trying to sleuth out how a bug like this might sneak into the game without Bungie detecting it, with one guess being that it’s due to a hidden bias somewhere in however the RNG is programmed for perk drops at the moment. Bungie hasn’t weighed back in to clarify if the community is still tilting at windmills or there really is some deeper problem at work that’s keeping players from getting the god roll they want. Whatever the actual truth of the matter turns out to be, the entire ordeal has players grappling with a much larger question: was Destiny’s loot chase <em>ever</em> actually good?</p><p>The game has always tried to walk a tightrope between giving players what they want when they want it and making them grind for it until they get lucky. Making loot easy and straightforward to attain would defeat the purpose of the game, but at some point too much busy work and RNG can make the whole thing feel more like operating a slot machine than actually having fun. These trade-offs, and how successfully Bungie is balancing them, have been at the forefront this month, especially because weapon crafting was semi-retired. </p><p>That system used to work as a source of bad-luck protection that eventually let players forge the exact god roll they wanted whether it ever dropped or not. It was a double-edged sword, however, because it also made actual god rolls redundant when players did happen upon them. Instead of grinding to unlock crafting patterns to make their preferred gun, players are now just back to toiling away in the same activities over and over again waiting to get lucky. As someone who returned to the <em>Destiny 2 </em>loot mines this month, it definitely sucks. </p><p>“The advantage of weapon crafting will always be superior to grinding weapons mindlessly,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one post</a></span> that recently gained a lot of attention on the subreddit. User lordofabyss basically argues that managing multiple rolls across dozens of weapons because you don’t know which one might unexpectedly become part of the future meta is a pain and a mess. It’s also a drag for those who don’t, for whatever reason, ever actually get the god roll they were chasing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another big thread points out that</a></span>, regardless of crafting, the overall level of rewards for harder activities in <em>Destiny 2</em> feel needlessly stingy. There’s nothing worse than running dungeon or raid encounters for an hour and getting nothing useful. </p><p>One conversation on Twitter put these long-standing issues with <em>Destiny 2 </em>in the context of MMOs more generally, which Bungie’s game has slowly become over the years. “RNG is RNG,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> CammyCakesYT. “Regardless of if there is an unknown underlying bug...<em>Destiny 2</em> grind feels bad compared to other games bc it has always been missing: Player trading, Crafting system for complex modifications, Cosmetics to use spare currency on.” Without diving deep into the weeds of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot chase compared to those in games like<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <em>Diablo IV</em>, or <em>Warframe</em>, one thing it’s clearly suffering from at the moment is the fact that god rolls are essentially the<em> only</em> thing to chase right now. </p><p>Maybe that will change with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541">next year’s ambitious <em>Codename: Frontier</em> plans</a></span>, which Bungie has said will borrow from metroidvanias and roguelikes to structure content in ways that potentially feels more fresh and satisfying. For now, bugged god rolls or not, the state of <em>Destiny 2</em> is feeling a bit shallow. The new dungeon is excellent and the potion-based tonic system this Episode is a really cool idea, but the underlying grind holding it altogether is feeling weaker than it has in a long time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you don’t have a party or costume lined up, you can still find a theater doing a screening on the night, or if you’re more inclined to stay indoors, maybe it’s worth perusing sales for great horror games. Xbox is hosting a sale right now for “Shocktober” that’s discounting a wide range of wonderfully scary games. Here are a few of the most worthwhile deals you can snag on Xbox till October 31.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s hard to go wrong with picking up any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290"><em>Resident Evil</em></a></span><em> </em>title this Halloween, since I’d argue they’re all varying degrees of good, depending on what you’re looking for.

It’s the first game in the series that I ever completed, and it’s one of the most effective horror games I’ve ever played. It turns out that a more methodical approach, a change in perspective, and a creepy Louisiana swamp and manor were all I needed to finally get into the series. <strong>You can pick up <em>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard </em>and all its DLC in the gold edition, which is available for just $16.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062"><em>Dead Space</em></a></span><em> </em>is simply one of the best to ever do it. It was a brutal and necessary revitalization of the survival-horror genre back in 2008, and its remake inherits the finest qualities of the original while polishing its roughest edges. At a time when remakes are more prevalent than ever—and they often buck the trend by being more stylistic reinterpretations rather than 1:1 retellings—the latest <em>Dead Space </em>is shockingly faithful, and it’s a welcome sight. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and <em>Dead Space </em>is incredibly smart to leave well enough alone. However, it also brings the original’s already sky-high production values to an even more elevated level, making it one of the most robust and impressive horror packages available. <em><strong>Dead Space </strong></em><strong>is only $21 right now, but alternatively you can pick it up on EA Play through Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Alien: Isolation </em>is <em>finally </em>receiving a sequel</a></span>, which seemed like such an easy layup when it first set the world on fire ten years ago. That means that this first-person horror game is now essential material to get to before that sequel is eventually released. And what a great time you’re about to have with it, because <em>Alien: Isolation </em>is an all-timer. </p><p>Talk about ridiculously high production values; <em>Isolation </em>nails the retro-futuristic vision of the dystopian capitalist nightmare Ridley Scott’s film so thoroughly brought to life. The gadgetry that you use in <em>Isolation</em>, and the surfaces of the station you explore, all seem positively ripped from the set of <em>Alien</em>. Best of all, it makes a tangible and menacing threat of the Xenomorph, which stalks you throughout the game. <strong>The game might be too long for its own good, but </strong><em><strong>Alien: Isolation </strong></em><strong>is still one of the most important horror games of the 2010s, and one of the very best licensed titles out there. You can now snag it for $10.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think there are fewer real things more frightening than the sea. I’ll never go to space and witness the expanse of that void for myself, but I do regularly dip my toe into the Atlantic, and that’s about as close to that experience as I’m getting. I enjoy a good beach, but it’s everything beyond them that sends a chill down my spine. The sea goes so much deeper than we can really fathom <em>(You’re fired—Ed)</em>, and hides so many freaky creatures and manners of life that are hard to conceive. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Dredge</em></a></span><em> </em>taps into that for its nightmare fuel.</p><p>In this Lovecraftian mystery set at sea, you are tasked with the operation of a small ship adrift on cursed waters. On your utterly horrifying voyages, you will dredge (heh) up all manner of sea creatures, from mundane fish to…other stranger things that dare not be named or looked at. At night, a fog falls over the sea that restricts your sight, plays tricks on the mind, and deteriorates your sanity unless you rest or find a safe harbor. <em>Dredge </em>is never outright terrifying, but like my favorite horror, there’s a tinge of dread everywhere you go that more than makes up for the lack of jump scares. <em><strong>Dredge </strong></em><strong>and all its DLC are available in a complete edition for $32.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>So the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684"><em>Dead Rising </em>games</a></span> aren’t really scary (unless you’re absolutely terrified by the passage of time) but neither is every single piece of work in the horror genre. Horror is so immensely flexible, and it is quite often actually deeply funny. <em>Dead Rising </em>takes zombies and makes them hilarious by dropping you into worlds filled with tools to mix and match, to create ridiculous weapons of mass undead slaughter—like motorcycles with chainsaws attached to them. </p><p>If hacking and slashing scores of the undead in an increasingly wacky fashion sounds like the ideal way to spend your Halloween season, then pick up any of the <em>Dead Rising </em>games that are currently discounted on Xbox.<strong> </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record </strong></em><strong>seem like the fan favorites, but </strong><em><strong>3 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>4 </strong></em><strong>are also on sale, and all of them are going for five or six dollars right now, making them a steal no matter what.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think the <em>Metro </em>series from 4A Games are some of the tightest, weirdest, and most immersive first-person shooters on the market right now. But while <em>Exodus </em>is my favorite, it’s hard to recommend for anyone looking for a horror game right now. However, the first two games in the series—<em>Metro 2033 </em>and <em>Metro: Last Light</em>,—are both much more linear and scarier titles.</p><p>Both are mainly set in the claustrophobic tunnels of the Russian underground, which are plagued by monstrosities and supernatural phenomena that lurk in the dark. Encounters against these creatures are regularly fraught with tension, and both <em>2033 </em>and <em>Last Light </em>lean more into the rhythm and pace of the horror genre, while sprinkling in doses of human drama and psychological terror. They’re also, crucially, shorter games, meaning that you can reasonably pack all those scares into a weekend. <em><strong>Metro 2033 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Metro: Last Light </strong></em><strong>are each discounted to $3, or you can pick up the bundle of all three games for $9.</strong></p></div><div><p>I don’t really consider <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006"><em>Prey</em></a></span><em> </em>a horror game, but it does terrify the player frequently enough that I might begin reconsidering that position. Every new room you step into is, after all, an entirely new environment that <em>could </em>be hiding a shape-shifting alien waiting to get the jump on you. Mimics aren’t even the worst thing you run into in <em>Prey</em>. Typhon alien species takes various shapes, like the always-intimidating Phantoms that blast you the minute they catch sight of you.Late in the game, a particularly huge Typhon simply hangs over you in certain areas and menaces you to no end.</p><p> There are lots of smaller moments and decisions like these that lend <em>Prey </em>the energy of a horror game, and it manages to get under your skin more effectively than a lot of attempts at horror in this medium. <strong>If you want to see for yourself how terrifying </strong><em><strong>Prey </strong></em><strong>can really be, pick it up while it’s $6, or snag it on Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p>First off, it goes without saying that in order to enjoy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914"><em>Undead Nightmare</em></a></span>, you must first have <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. You might want to have played the game too, because this zombie-themed DLC functions as a bit of a goofy epilogue to the main story. However it’s worth it to be able to play <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, which is still one of the very best DLCs I’ve ever picked up. A curse has fallen over the West, resurrecting the dead in hordes and turning <em>Red Dead Redemption </em>into a campy, <em>Evil Dead</em>-ish parody of itself and the horror genre. It is wonderful.</p><p>I remember <em>Undead Nightmare </em>being particularly impressive when it was released. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>’s vision of the dying west was always sparse, but this DLC turned that quiet contemplative isolation into something to be scared of. Scores of zombies appear seemingly out of nowhere and set on you and your horse, and the primary design of its set-piece missions involves fighting off waves of them in order to defend the few spots of civilization left. Mythical creatures, like four horses that resemble the horsemen of the apocalypse, can be found in the wild. <em>Undead Nightmare</em> utterly transforms the game in ways I didn’t think Rockstar would ever do, and it’s a trick that the developer has seemed reluctant to pull off again in the decade-and-a-half since. <strong>So if you’ve got the original game on your Xbox and $8 to spare, pick up </strong><em><strong>Undead Nightmare </strong></em><strong>and experience one of the goofiest and best DLCs to ever grace a game.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will officially be released tomorrow, and Treyarch just released a set of preseason patch notes following the latest update. Here is everything you can find in the recent Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-preseason-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has ensured players are prepared for the release of Black Ops 6, as many have been waiting for this game for months now. With so many cool new features, the hype around this game has been absolutely absurd.</p>



<p>So, what was everything included in the preseason patch notes?</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign">Campaign</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 campaign has already proven to be quite unique compared to past Call of Duty campaigns. The story takes place after the events of Black Ops Cold War and the 1980’s flashbacks from Black Ops II. </p>



<p>In their patch notes, Treyarch iterated that Black Ops 6 is meant to bring a mix of familiar AND fresh content to players, helping feed that nostalgia fix while also leading a path forward for the series. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game will also have a customizable safe house called “The Rook,” where players can prepare weapons and more before each mission. The campaign will also feature rewards players can utilize in Multiplayer, Warzone and Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h2>



<p>Zombies are back! Black Ops has been notorious in the past for having some of the best Zombies modes, and it seems like Black Ops 6 will be no different. </p>



<p>What’s better yet is the fact that Round-Based Zombies will officially be making its return. At launch there will be two Zombies maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Liberty Falls</strong></li>



<li><strong>Terminus</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, as the game progresses, more Zombie maps will be released.</p>



<p>The Main Quest and all Side Quests will also go live at 10 AM PST on October 25, 2024, so be prepared to start fighting. Looks like Der Wunderfizz will also be making an appearance in games after Round 25.</p>



<p>The patch notes also revealed that players can achieve some Whimsical GobblueGums in the game after these rounds:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Round 15-29:</strong>&nbsp;1 Whimsical GobbleGum&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 30-44:</strong>&nbsp;2 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 45+:</strong>&nbsp;3 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Zombies are SO back.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made some HEAVY adjustments to multiplayer in the preseason patch notes for Black Ops 6. Here is everything we know.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>On release, Call of Duty announced that Black Ops 6 will have 33 weapons at launch, all customizable. However, Call of Duty has made some changes to weapons ahead of the game’s release.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapon-balance">Weapon Balance </h4>



<ul>
<li>Aim Assist weaker at point-blank ranges</li>



<li>Improved Pistol and Dedicated Melee swap speeds</li>



<li>Adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS</li>



<li>Improved Depth of Field across all Weapons&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-movement">Movement</h4>



<ul>
<li>Added a toggle option for Corner Slicing&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an option to set the hold time to perform a Dive to Prone or Slide depending on your Slide/Dive Behavior setting&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an Intelligent Movement option to set Mantle Assist Angle from tight, medium, or wide&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps">Maps</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to Multiplayer adjustments, Call of Duty has made quite a few adjustments to the maps, which were playable in the beta. Here are all the Multiplayer map adjustments posted on the game’s patch notes:</p>



<h4>Skyline&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Expanded the cover points around the hot tub at the center of the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added new planters as cover near the far spawn point.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added multiple cover options throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Scud&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted bullet penetration values on the satellite dish panels to allow additional bullet penetration.
<ul>
<li>The concrete wall at the main overwatch is now broken out, which will allow more bullet penetration to make it slightly less powerful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Panels are doubled up at the side overwatch to still amount a small amount of bullet penetration where there was previously none.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Made additional cover improvements throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Rewind&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Made cover improvements across multiple sightlines.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-audio">Audio</h2>



<p>The game has also made some adjustments to the audio. The game announced they are officially introducing a brand-new feature called HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) via Universal Profile in Enhanced Headphone Mode, which is available to all players for free.</p>



<p>What is, HRTF, though? This new audio enhancement will truly give players the feel of being in the action, as it gives the game a much more purposeful and directional soundscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-anti-cheat">Anti-Cheat</h2>



<p>Luckily, Treyarch will be doubling down on cheaters with its Anti-Cheat system. The new RICOCHET Anti-Cheat system will include the following features (as posted via the company’s patch notes):</p>



<ul>
<li>Kernel-Level Driver (PC) detection and monitoring updates across all protected titles, including Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty®: Warzone™&nbsp;</li>



<li>#TeamRICOCHET mitigations live in Black Ops 6 multiplayer, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, and more&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning behavioral systems deployed to increase speed of detection&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning detection models were added to analyze gameplay combating aim bots&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-weapon-damage">Weapon Damage</h2>



<p>The last bit of information included in the Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes was dedicated to weapon damage. The team at Treyarch is creating a new Weapon Damage Adjustment table for the game to help establish better definitions of weapon damage adjustments.</p>



<p>The table will highlight adjustments made to weapons as the game’s different seasons progress, hoping to not leave any players confused about changes revolving around their favorite guns.</p>



<p>With all these patch notes, are you excited for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>

<p>If you’re worried your platform’s hard drive will struggle to contend with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s file size—a logical assumption based on previous CoD titles—this guide has everything you need to know about BLOPS 6 file sizes on different platforms.</p>



<p>Like you, I’ve suffered the wrath of Call of Duty file sizes down the years. From Warzone to Black Ops Cold War, and the recent Modern Warfare reboot sequels, my PlayStation 5 has struggled to balance my library of games due to CoD’s exorbitant file sizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is the latest release to fall under the Call of Duty umbrella. This means CoD HQ is starting to get crowded—as is my PS5 storage. With the BLOPS 6 release finally upon us, let’s check out the FPS’ file sizes across the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-playstation">How Big is Black Ops 6 on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No, you can’t have my storage space. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>You need to have <strong>84.40 GB free</strong> to install the entirety of Black Ops 6 on your PlayStation console. This figure is broken up into <strong>46.01 GB</strong> for the multiplayer component of the title, <strong>16.86 GB</strong> for Campaign Pack 1, and <strong>21.53 GB</strong> for Campaign Pack 2.</p>



<p>Even though it isn’t specified, presumably, this content also includes Zombies—but I can’t be certain which of three files it’s attached to. If you want to better manage your file sizes, you can chop and change content as you please. For example, if you have no interest in multiplayer for the time being, you can always manage Black Ops 6’s installed game content and pick and choose as you please.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-xbox">How Big is Black Ops 6 on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 weighs in at <strong>85.56 GB</strong> on Xbox—according to the official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-standard-edition/9N58QRBG9WDG/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox BLOPS 6 store page</a>.</p>



<p>If you navigate to the game’s page on the storefront, click on “More” for further details, and scroll down, you can see a figure of “86.56GB” under the approximate size section of the “Additional info.” </p>



<p>It was reported a few months back you needed an eyewatering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-300-gb-install-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300GB to play Black Ops 6 on Xbox</a>; however, this was later refuted, and it turned out this is the total number of GB required to have every CoD title installed for CoD HQ. Breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-pc">How Big is Black Ops 6 on PC?</h2>



<p>Finally, you need to have at least <strong>102 GB of SSD space</strong> to run Black Ops 6 on PC, whether through Steam or Battle.net.</p>



<p>This information was revealed when Activision themselves confirmed the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pc-specs-launch-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimum and recommended PC spec requirements</a> for BLOPS 6. Although, I recommended you have more than this to incorporate extra CoD content—as well as a year’s worth of updates sure to follow, starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone loves being able to play their favorite video games from their phone and more with emulators, but is video game emulation legal?</p>



<h2 id="h-video-game-emulation-is-it-legal">Video Game Emulation: Is it Legal?</h2>



<p>Emulators have been around for quite some time. People have made them for phones, PCs and even devices like calculators (I am not kidding). But what is the legality of playing a game on an emulator?</p>



<p>I mean, no one wants to get in trouble for video game emulation, but quite a few people would love to play their favorite Pokemon game without having to buy an old game boy that costs $100 or more.</p>



<p>So, are game emulators legal?</p>



<h6 id="h-related-hyperx-quadcast-2-s-review-high-quality-streaming-and-gaming-microphone">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyperx-quadcast-2-s-review-high-quality-streaming-and-gaming-microphone/">HyperX Quadcast 2 S Review: High-Quality Streaming and Gaming Microphone</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-video-game-emulators">Video Game Emulators</h2>



<p>The legality of video game emulators depends on a few different factors. Actual emulators are not illegal. If you find one on the App Store, go ahead and download it. You won’t get reprimanded for it. </p>



<p>But what about the actual games?</p>



<p>Well, a video game emulation is technically not illegal IF you purchase the game and then rip it onto an emulator. It becomes illegal once you start sharing that emulator (or selling it) with other people. </p>



<p>This violates various copyright infringement laws, and there is really no way around it. Downloading ROMs from websites for free is technically illegal, too, but the main person who would get in trouble is the person distributing them</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-be-playing-video-game-emulators">Should You be Playing Video Game Emulators?</h2>



<p>It is really up to your own personal discretion on whether or not you should be playing video game emulators. More than likely, you will never get in trouble. However, if you plan on ripping games and distributing them to others, there is more of a chance you could get caught and fined.</p>



<p>If a company like Nintendo finds out, there may be a hefty lawsuit in your hands.</p>

allow players to further customize their experience," the publisher says.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the familiar accessibility features that were included with Modern Warfare 3 will also be available in Black Ops 6, such as graphical adjustment options to reduce motion blur and joystick setting options. However, new settings aim to improve the customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes Black Ops 6's new asymmetrical hearing compensation setting, which allows players with asymmetrical hearing loss to create a custom audio profile and adjust audio settings for each ear. Activision says this was created with veterans and players with hearing loss in mind, allowing the audio settings to be individually customizable for each ear.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also recently detailed Black Ops 6's more immersive audio features and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-gets-audio-upgrades-plus-setting-to-help-with-tinnitus/1100-6527145/">discussed the new Reduce Tinnitus Sound accessibility setting</a>. In addition to audio features, Black Ops 6 will also include some new visual accessibility settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's High Contrast mode was first introduced in Modern Warfare 3, giving players the option to highlight allies and enemies during gameplay, but the feature was only available for the campaign. This year, High Contrast mode will be available to use in both campaign and Zombies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873"></a><figcaption>High Contrast mode in Zombies</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode has also been upgraded, so now players will be able to customize the color outline of allies and enemies, which allows those with vision impairment and color blindness to tailor their player experience even more. Players will even be able to enable a "Dark Background" setting in High Contrast mode, which further adds contrast from the background elements to assist with low vision. An example of this can be seen in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">Another newly introduced feature in Black Ops 6 is the ability to adjust the gameplay HUD with a variety of layout presets, as well as color adjustments for the minimap. Activision says that players who wish to reduce visual clutter or find the minimap distracting might want to test out the Target Tracker or Central Command presets.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Zombies maps feature spider-like enemies, so players will have an option to toggle on an optional arachnophobia setting, which visually removes the enemies' legs. The image shown below reveals how the enemy will look with and without the setting activated. Activision says this setting will change their appearance "without affecting their gameplay," but it's uncertain how this will work for the enemy hitboxes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874"></a><figcaption>Zombies mode arachnophobia setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another new feature for Zombies is the ability to pause, save, and then load back into games. It's worth noting that this feature comes with some restrictions. This pause and save feature is only available when playing solo matches, and a player can only save and quit while at full health.</p><p dir="ltr">"With the return of round-based Zombies, gameplay is guaranteed to be fast-paced and intense, so providing the ability to pause or save a solo game and return later can make all the difference in gameplay for some players," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the publisher confirms that both the Xbox Adaptive controller and Sony's Access controller will work out of the box with Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <p>A huge scary bearded man has just kicked down my door. His face and shoulders are doused in tactical Dorito dust. His eyes are heavily redacted. He's got assault rifles and comparison screenshots poking out of his ribcage, which are making an absolute mess of the hallway plaster. He says he is Call Of Duty Man, and he is here to let me know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s day one patch. The new Activision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-time">out tomorrow 25th October</a>, I gather. Call Of Duty Man speaks only in three-syllable bursts and rolling bombardments, but I think if I listen carefully I can make out the highlights. Here's what that patch involves, in nickel-plated bulletpoint form.</p>
<p>- <strong>They've been fiddling around with the aim assists</strong>. During the Black Ops 6 beta, developers Treyarch tried turning off aim assist when firing at close range, but players found this disorienting. "While this was a change in the right direction, we felt that this was a bit jarring when crossing that close range threshold, so we've adjusted our approach to linearly interpolate aim assist strength," Call Of Duty Man roars in my ear. "This means that aim assist will be much weaker at point blank ranges and smoothly increase in strength out to a short range. We will of course continue to monitor and assess data and player feedback."</p>
<p>GOOD STUFF. They've also accelerated pistol/dedicated melee swap speeds and weapon butt melee attacks, while making "adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS". There are some new movement options, too, such as being able to change how long you need to hold a button when diving to prone or sliding.</p>
<p>- <strong>They've made stealthy tweaks to the map furniture</strong>. In particular, a ferocious amount of time and energy has been lavished on the hot tub area on Skyline - lowering the platform behind it, adding some extra steps, swapping out the old balcony loungers for some relatively unrelaxing deckchairs. At a glance, the only thing they've forgotten about is the ability to fill up the hot tub and sit in it, which I, personally, would consider optimal escapism.</p><p>What's more, Skyline now has a janitor, as evidenced by the cleaning trolley that has materialised in one corridor. I was a janitor once and let me tell you, if somebody had tried hiding behind my trolley with an AK I'd have drenched them in mop water. Less dramatically, local hooligans have been messing with the crates and barrels on Scud, and whoever left that pick-up in the disabled parking space on Rewind has finally come back to collect it.</p>
<p>- <strong>They've beefed up the anticheat</strong>. "TeamRICOCHET mitigations live in Black Ops 6 multiplayer, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, and more," shrieks Call Of Duty Man, punching me in the shoulders. "Machine-learning behavioral systems deployed to increase speed of detection," he continues, weeping uncontrollably. "Machine-learning detection models added to analyze gameplay combating aim bots." Hang on, let me pour him a hearty restorative cherryade. There there, Call Of Duty Man, I'm sure the aimbots won't mind if you sit down for five minutes.</p>
<p>- <strong>They're taking a new approach to visualising weapon balance changes</strong>. I'm actually quite interested in this one, albeit more as jumping-off point for musings about the culture of game balance at lage. "In the past, our patch notes used some terms to describe damage values at various ranges that could create some mild confusion for some players," concedes Call Of Duty Man, who is now skulking under my desk (I think he misheard "cherryade" as "grenade"). As such, the developers have created a new kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-weapons">weapon</a> damage adjustment table for future Blops 6 (and Call Of Duty: Warzone) patchnotes.</p>
<p>It's nothing remarkable in itself - just a couple of columns labelled "before patch" and "after patch", with rows for damage at different ranges. But one thought it inspires is that discussion of balancing in multiplayer shooters can be quite patch to patch, with minimal sense of a timeline. I wonder if there's scope for some nice, big <em>graphs</em> here, Treyarch. Show me how the C9 SMG of today has evolved from its distant ancestor, the C9 SMG of six months ago.</p><p>There are third-party tools for this, I'm sure, but it would be useful if players and journalists could easily assess the overall evolution of a game's balance without visiting, I don't know, IsCODNerfed.com. Perhaps it would make for less toxicity in the community? Perhaps if there's less toxicity, Call Of Duty Man will stop chewing on my ankle?</p>

Aim assist is always a hot topic within the Call of Duty community with each game’s release, so it will be interesting to see feedback now the game is out in the wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are improved pistol and dedicated melee swap speeds, a slight increase to weapon butt melee attack speeds, and adjustments to sway, bob, and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS (aim down sights).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helpfully, Activision included a weapon damage range explainer in the patch notes, which go into detail on how damage actually works in Black Ops 6 and Warzone from Season 01.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-built-in-support-for-better-audio-tech-that-costs-20-for-5-years">its built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match">Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters</a>, and confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ends-the-3-year-scourge-of-the-riot-shield">Riot Shield</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">MULTIPLAYER</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Weapons</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 33 weapons at launch waiting for you to unlock and customize.

Weapon balance is always ongoing, so we’ll be evaluating data and feedback, and sharing updates on this regularly. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>In the Multiplayer Beta we tested a change that disabled aim assist at close ranges. While this was a change in the right direction, we felt that this was a bit jarring when crossing that close range threshold, so we’ve adjusted our approach to linearly interpolate aim assist strength. This means that aim assist will be much weaker at point blank ranges and smoothly increase in strength out to a short range. We will of course continue to monitor and assess data and player feedback. </li><li>Improved Pistol and Dedicated Melee swap speeds </li><li>Slight increase to Weapon Butt melee attack speeds </li><li>Adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS <ul data-cy="list"><li>Additional improvements coming in Season 01 </li></ul></li><li>Improved Depth of Field across all Weapons </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Movement </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added a toggle option for Corner Slicing  </li><li>Added an option to set the hold time to perform a Dive to Prone or Slide depending on your Slide/Dive Behavior setting </li><li>Added an Intelligent Movement option to set Mantle Assist Angle from tight, medium, or wide </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Multiplayer Map Adjustments </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen eyes have already noticed a handful of changes we have introduced to our Beta maps thanks to everyone’s amazing feedback. Delivering fair and consistent gameplay will always remain our goal, and as such we’ve introduced some additional cover and changes to make firefights a bit fairer, as well as various lighting changes. The below selects aren’t every change we have made, but they’ll help provide an idea of what to expect from Beta to Launch.</p>Skyline <ul data-cy="list"><li>Expanded the cover points around the hot tub at the center of the map. </li><li>Added new planters as cover near far spawn point. </li><li>Added multiple cover options throughout the map.</li></ul>Scud <ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjusted bullet penetration values on the satellite dish panels to allow additional bullet penetration.  <ul data-cy="list"><li>The concrete wall at the main overwatch is now broken out, which will allow more bullet penetration to make it slightly less powerful. </li><li>Panels are doubled up at the side overwatch to still amount a small amount of bullet penetration where there was previously none. </li></ul></li><li>Made additional cover improvements throughout the map. </li></ul>Rewind <ul data-cy="list"><li>Made cover improvements across multiple sightlines.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Audio </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We’re excited to introduce our best-in-class audio experience coming to Black Ops 6 with the introduction of HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) via Universal Profile in Enhanced Headphone Mode, which is available to all players for free. </li><li>We’ve also added a setting to disable licensed music across all modes, particularly useful for content creators streaming the game.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For a closer look at our innovations in adaptive audio, spatial reverb, physics-based acoustics, game sound prioritization, HRTF support, and all-new asymmetrical hearing compensation technology, check out <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-dynamic-soundscape-audio-intel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our dedicated audio blog</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">RICOCHET Anti-Cheat </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">RICOCHET Anti-Cheat systems activated for Black Ops 6.

In the past, our patch notes used some terms to describe damage values at various ranges that could create some mild confusion for some players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, we aim to avoid this confusion two-fold:  </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Creating a new Weapon Damage Adjustment table for Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01 patch notes. </li><li>Establishing Weapon Damage Range definitions for Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01 moving forward. </li></ul><strong>Weapon Damage Adjustment Table </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">New in Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, we're introducing a new table to highlight the changes a weapon has undergone from one patch to the next. You'll find it nested within our existing tables in our attempt to keep information as detailed and centralized as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new table will comprise three columns (Damage Range, Pre-Patch, and Post-Patch) and rows of up to five to account for each applicable Damage Range for a given weapon. In each Pre-Patch/Post-Patch cell, the corresponding Damage and Range (in meters) values will be found.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For easier understanding, we'll identify "positive" (⇧) and "negative" (⇩) adjustments with an arrow like what you see in-game.</p><strong>Weapon Damage Range Explainer  </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, not all weapons are created the equal, but all of them respect the fundamental principle that the closer your target is to you, the more damage you will deal to them. Using the following dynamic ranges, we identify how damage works in Multiplayer and Warzone: </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Maximum Damage Range </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>This range outlines the maximum potential damage a weapon can output in a single shot up to a specified distance. </li><li>This range will always start at 0 meters and extend outward until a player falls outside of our Maximum Damage Range, where damage begins to "step down." </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Medium and Minimum Damage Ranges </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Picking up right after the Maximum Damage Range ends, we use Medium and Minimum Damage Ranges to identify how damage will "step down" in potency over distance. </li><li>Remember how we said not all weapons are created equal? Some weapons can have up to three Medium Damage Ranges while some can have zero. <ul data-cy="list"><li>In situations where a weapon only has one Medium Damage Range, we will label this Medium Damage range as-is.  </li><li>If a weapon has no Medium Damage Range, we’ll omit over the Medium Damage Range rows. </li></ul></li><li>Medium Damage Ranges <ul data-cy="list"><li>Picking up right after the Maximum Damage Range ends, we use Medium Damage Ranges to identify how damage will "step down" over distance. </li><li>Reminder: A weapon with Medium Damage Ranges can have a minimum of one Medium Damage Range and a maximum of three.  </li><li>In all future Damage Range Adjustment tables, we'll identify these Medium Damage Ranges as 1, 2, and 3 when applicable, with One (1) being closest to the player and Three (3) being the furthest within the Medium Damage Ranges. <ul data-cy="list"><li>In previous patch notes versions, these were identified as “Close-Mid,” “Near-Mid,” “Mid,” “Mid-Far,” or “Far-Mid.” </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Minimum Damage Range  <ul data-cy="list"><li>This range identifies the minimum potential damage a player can receive at the furthest distances. </li><li>This range will always pick up right after the furthest Medium Damage Range ends and will continue indefinitely unless otherwise noted. <ul data-cy="list"><li>Reminder: Some weapons can have no Medium Damage Range and will enter a Minimum Damage Range immediately after the Maximum Damage Range. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One Last Thing:</strong> As we progress through our future Seasons, the teams at Treyarch and Raven will adjust weapons based on feedback and data to deliver the best experiences possible for Multiplayer and Warzone respectively. These adjustments may include shared Black Ops 6 weapons having different Damage Range values between titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>A new patch has gone live for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the key takeaway from this update is that stealth missions should be less frustrating to play. Developer Massive Entertainment says that it has focused on improving stealth to give players more flexibility, and another welcome fix being introduced in the update is an improvement to speeder travel.</p><p>Stealth in Outlaws was fairly unforgiving when the game first launched, although this has been fine-tuned over the last couple of weeks. The new tweaks aim to reduce the frequency of instant-fail moments during specific missions, allowing players to have more options at their disposal to complete these sequences.</p><p>For speeder travel, the developer says it is "reducing collisions" with objects in the environment through this patch. A notorious bug in Outlaws, speeder travel could often result in Kay Vess experiencing low-orbit travel when she was flung from her vehicle while traveling on a seemingly safe route.</p><p>Massive says it also investigating other issues in the PC version of the game. "We are also aware of an ongoing issue affecting PC players after the 24H2 Windows Update," <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/2Vn4XE0lBNrsqFhfkqjrs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the studio wrote in the patch notes</a>. "We are working hard to identify both the root cause and its resolution. This investigation is taking some time; therefore, the fix couldn't be ready for this Title Update. We'll deploy one as soon as it's ready and update all affected players."</p><p>Other gameplay fixes include improved NPC behavior, increased auto-save opportunities in open-world hostile areas, and "Wanted" difficulty will now scale according to player progression. You can see the full patch notes below, which cover various other technical parts of the game as well.</p><p>This is the third major update for Outlaws, following its launch in August. While the game was generally well-received, it was criticized for a heavy number of bugs and <a

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age™: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Artifacts that have been dormant for centuries are awakening," a voiceover explains as a metallic monster somewhat resembling <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16786-animated-armor" rel="nofollow ">Animated Armor</a> roars to life and begins wreaking havoc. Later, an unseen creature with <em>far</em> too many tentacles can be seen grabbing a guard by the throat and (presumably) dragging him to his doom.</p><p dir="ltr">"The dead… stir more easily than they should," remarks Emmrich Volkarin, who serves as a companion character and The Veilguard's resident necromancer. Another voiceover comments that dragons have been "feeding on the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Blight" rel="nofollow ">Blight</a>," and announces that "<a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspawn" rel="nofollow ">Darkspawn</a> are charging to <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Weisshaupt" rel="nofollow ">Weisshaupt</a>," which serves as the headquarters of the Grey Wardens faction. Frankly, things are <em>not</em> looking good for Thedas and its inhabitants in the new trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also depicts the game's main antagonist, Solas, who can be seen wielding the unstable power he's gained from ripping open <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Veil" rel="nofollow ">The Veil</a>, with eyes glowing a greenish-blue as magic swirls around his hands. Solas himself was a romance option for players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, though he's not on the companion roster this time around (which is fair--destroying the world really puts a damper on any potential chance for romance). All in all, it seems that Rook and the rest of The Veilguard crew will have quite a few challenges to conquer if they hope to save Thedas from Solas' wicked plans.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches on October 31. For more information on BioWare's upcoming fantasy RPG (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/" data-ref-id="1100-6525830">preorder deals</a>), check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-everything-we-know-about-biowares-upcoming-fantasy-rpg/1100-6503858/">everything we know about The Veilguard</a>.</p>

You're reviewing a pitch document, and after a few quick pages describing familiar gameplay (hack-and-slash, magic, etc.), you're bombarded with a few thousand words of backstory that's meant to sound like a groundbreaking new IP that will redefine video games. It sounds great. But how do you have any idea if it will catch on?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, you don't. It's why so many developers beg newcomers to spend less time worldbuilding and more time scrapping together prototypes. But eventually the day comes around when your team does need to build a brand new fantasy setting. You're probably at a smaller studio, you don't have a big franchise to lean on, and you'll only have so much leeway to build big new mechanical systems. What do you do then?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Obsidian Entertainment's been tackling that challenge for most of its lifetime. Its library is filled with games in original worlds like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Pillars of Eternity series (we have to give a shoutout to the original wild-as-heck original role-playing game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while we're here).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plenty of developers who worked on the games are still at the company, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Carrie Patel. The the first-person action adventure game set in the world of Pillars of Eternity is Patel's latest, after rising through the ranks from game writer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/directing-i-the-outer-worlds-i-first-narrative-expansion-i-the-peril-on-gorgon-i-">directing the DLC </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/directing-i-the-outer-worlds-i-first-narrative-expansion-i-the-peril-on-gorgon-i-">The Peril on Gordon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Now on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she's helping the team tackle the daunting task of making the Pillars setting a can't-miss for a wider audience.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/hidetaka-miyazaki-s-advice-for-challenging-game-design-trust-players-" target="_self">Hidetaka Miyazaki's advice for challenging game design: 'Trust players'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is the answer to do some riff on "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">familiar, but with a twist?</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" Sort of. Patel said the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team has spent plenty of time picking up where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Josh Sawyer's worldbuilding left off. Sawyer, a history buff, leaned on lesser-explored historical inspirations like the era of the Dutch and East India trading colonies. "Familiar," sure, but probably only if you were paying attention in world history class taught by the high school football coach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is equal parts grounded politics and metaphysical encounters with the divine. Patel explained to Game Developer in a chat at Gamescom 2024 that to make these big-brained concepts accessible to all players, the team looked at them through this lens: how can players use these ideas to build their own stories beyond the narrative?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building your own identity in the strange new world of ">Building your own identity in the strange new world of <span>Avowed</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patel explained that as she's grown into the role of game director, she's expanded how she walks through gameplay when sampling what the team has produced. "You slow down and try to notice each moment of your experience," she said. The questions she asks herself include "when am I excited? When am I curious? When is my attention starting to wane? What's drawing me from moment to moment?" Obsidian's practices of iterating fast and putting content in the build "quickly" make it more possible for her to bring those questions back to her peers and give them time and direction to iterate with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're questions players will undoubtedly be asking themselves when they pick up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, since for many it will be their first time entering the complex world of Eora. The game is set in a region called "The Living Lands," where political players and gods are wheeling and dealing to control the world. "I've enjoyed finding the stories that thread both of those worlds together," she said with palpable excitement. What makes it possible for players to pick up her enthusiasm is a clear sense of direction that they need to make their own choices about the world.</span></p><p>Sometimes that choice is "what to do about this bear?" Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's metaphysical elements are defined by the idea that like real-world religions (depending on who you ask), there's no "one right answer" that determines how the divine works. She recalled reading Reddit threads where players debated the ending of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and arguing about which god to support as being "clearly the right choice."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trick, however, is that developers don't want those to be "even" choices, especially "morally" even ones. "It's not saying all things have an equal moral weight to them, but you're not trying to say 'player, this is what you must choose,'" she said. "You're saying 'player, here's a world and here's a conflict and all of its complexities, and there's not always going to be an easy solution.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players enjoy defining a setting for themselves">Players enjoy defining a setting for themselves</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Obsidian's long made games in this way—a way that places a remarkable amount of trust in players. You might look back to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company's take on the Fallout series which gives players a far wider array of narrative tools to influence the Wasteland than its predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Bethesda Softworks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patel's experience echoes some advice like we've heard from game directors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/hidetaka-miyazaki-s-advice-for-challenging-game-design-trust-players-">Hidekai Miyazaki</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. His words "trust players" feel present in her words, but she also captured why it still takes an incredible amount of work to build that trust in the first place.</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Letting players define their place in the setting "gives players something to chew on," she said, adding that it's "one of the most interesting aspects of roleplay."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's not just 'who am I mechanically, what's my vibe.' It's also 'what do I believe in, and how do the situations I'm encountering in this world force me to answer that question?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Force" there is the key word. In an industry that leans on "power fantasies" to excite and attract players, being forced to do anything can be an off-putting pitch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe if you're one of those worldbuilding-minded developers (look, I feel you, I have a few mega-tomes sitting on my personal hard drive), that's what your game world needs.

			<p>The new <a href="https://wccftech.com/sniper-elite-4-coming-to-the-mac-ipad-iphone-later-this-year/">Sniper Elite</a> game is slated for release on January 30, 2025. The full title of the game is Sniper Elite: Resistance, and it will take players through a standalone story that runs parallel to Sniper Elite 5. You play Harry Hawker, an agent of the Special Operations Executive, and you have to fight back against the Nazis in occupied France. For those eager to get their hands on the game, Sniper Elite: Resistance will launch physically and digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Microsoft Store. Additionally, Sniper Elite: Resistance will be available via Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance – Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyqDitom1QQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is the Standard Edition of the game, as well as a Deluxe Edition, which will include Season Pass content. Those who pre-order the game, regardless of the edition, will get the bonus campaign mission called "Target Fuhrer," as well as an additional weapon skin and the Karabiner 98 Rifle. For those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition of Sniper Elite: Resistance, you'll get the classic M1911 Pistol as well as two days of Early Access.</p>
<p>The overview provided by <a href="https://rebellion.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebellion Developments</a> states that there are "unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth, and tactical third-person combat you would expect from the franchise." Instead of focusing on the front line happening in World War II, it focuses on the "hidden war," far from the front lines, that takes place deep in the heart of occupied France.</p>
<p>There will be a full-length campaign to play through, in either solo play or co-op. There will be the option to customize and upgrade your weapons to help you make your way through difficult challenges. Of course, much like any Sniper Elite game, the trademark X-ray kill cam will be returning, providing you with a glimpse into the pure destruction in each shot from your weapons.</p>
<p>For those who want to participate in multiplayer but don't want to team up with friends in the campaign, there are multiple multiplayer modes available, including the fan favorite Invasion mode and adversarial multiplayer.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release date of Sniper Elite: Resistance, a brand-new trailer has been uploaded to Youtube, with the video being just over a minute long.&nbsp; If you want to pre-order the game, it will cost you $49.99 for the Standard Edition of the game and $79.99 for the Deluxe Edition of Sniper Elite: Resistance. Check out the trailer for yourself in the video above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TItmouse, the production company behind a variety of popular adult animation shows such as <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="42a53bd9-3ace-4e7e-b9b3-8cb0409963bc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists">The Legend of Vox Machina,</a> Venture Bros, </em>and <em>Big Head</em> is launching a low-stakes TTRPG with a focus on drinking, smoking, and… whatever else you choose to partake in. The game – <em>Drunkards, Druggies, and Delinquents</em> – is live now on BackerKit looking forward to a 2025 release.</p>
<p>Hearing this, and already being a fan of games like Red Dragon Inn that merge deckbuilding and drinking, we were excited to sit down with Chris Pyrnoski, founder of Titmouse to learn where this idea came from and what it's like to play the game.</p>
<h2>From Yearly Client Gift To Fully Fledged TTRPG</h2>
<p>"I've always been a gamer," Prynoski began, after being asked about the inception of <em>Drunkards, Druggies, and Delinquents</em>, "I've always played Tabletop roleplaying games. We do this thing at the studio where we generally send out a client gift once a year. We usually do it around the holidays like Christmas, and New Year time, but we'd always miss it."</p>
<p>From an intended holiday season gift this slipping deadline would turn their gift into a valentines gift, or whatever holiday is past that. "Then we kinda settled on 4/20 as a time to mail stuff out because it's fun and we could do interesting stuff. The last few years we've done drug paraphernalia but this one I wanted to do a Dungeon Master screen."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//5Ao7Hej07X8"></iframe></p>
<p>Pyrnoski mentioned artists like Skinner and Heather Mahler who helped to create artwork for a DM screen that went out to their clients. "We sent that screen out as a 4/20 gift but we knew we had to put something on the inside. We wrote it in a Gygaxian style, we want this to read like an AD&amp;D book and make it hard to understand."</p>
<p>What started as a gift, became a joke (labeled Advanced Titmouse &amp; Titmouse at the time), and then Luke Gygax had a chance to play it and reached out to encourage Pyrnoski and Titmouse to create it as a full game. Listing out those who were part of the playtest process Pyrnoski dropped the names of Luke Gygax again, Travis Willingham, Jason Charles Miller, and many more.</p>
<p>"...and then we built it out into a real game. It's meant to be for a one-shot, and basically the game ends when any one or more players tap out but one of the things we've learned in the playtesting [...] is that we made a card for every class, a card for every monster, multiple cards for items, equipment, and characters. That way they're real big, you can see them when you're drunk, and everyone who wants one can have one as opposed to passing around this screen."</p>
<p>Pyrnoski stated that even at this time with the Backerkit live they're still working on the game and refining it further. "We're using [Backerkit] as a chance to put out polls and ask questions."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-components.jpg?itok=x_uqPNA7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-components.jpg?itok=iEVgCt4r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of the Stretch Goals available on the Backerkit aren't just in reference to the mechanics of the game either as goals for blacklight reactive ink and a printed Drunken Master guide zine that will show the Drunken Master what to do and prompt them with ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we unlock these goals we'll keep evolving the game"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Initially it was meant to be a really easy game for anybody, if you have RPG experience great but if you have zero experience that's fine."</p>
<p>Pyrnoski went on to explain that each character will have a Character Sheet, that will show artwork of their character, a punny name, and the character's abilities as well as an Adventure Log.</p>
<p>The game is played with a single D12. "When you first start you start with an automatic encounter to learn. You fight the drugbear monster and then if you clear the board of monsters you do a cheers. The screen gets passed over, you roll for a new monster/s and there's a little bit of choice because there's 19 monsters but only a twelve-sided dice."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=Hk-UxEX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=AsnGWEST 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This can lead to situations where depending on what you roll you can pick between a few options of what you want to have attacked the party, alternatively, there are other monsters that will pull more monsters from the deck onto the field.</p>
<p>Initially, the players HP and Armor Class were the same and the difference between your HP/AC and what number was on the dice would determine how much damage you took, or the player could take that many drinks. This evolved during playtesting because "no one would die, they would just drink. Now it's just the way that you die is that you declare you're drunk enough and you tap out of the game."</p>
<p>The role of DM, or Dunken Master, isn't one that a single player takes on but instead rotates between the players as the game continues. This is inspired from Prynoski's first experiences playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons where he and his friends didn't know that only one player was meant to be the DM so they would take it in turns reading slightly ahead and running the games for one another. As a player "you would be discovering as the Dungeon Master does."</p>
<p>After every round of combat the DM screen gets shifted around the table. This way everyone gets a chance to run the monsters. "My initial concept for the game was basically for it to be a combat system. A murder hobo kind of game. You're just in some kinda dungeon, you introduce your characters, and you immediately start getting attacked."</p>
<p>When in playtesting for <em>Drunkards, Druggies, and Delinquents</em> Prynoski was surprised when players instinctively took it further though. "I was surprised by how much roleplay people injected into it. It was a lot of fun to play not only from a combat side, but from the roleplay side."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-character-class-artwork.jpg?itok=fl7MfaGT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-character-class-artwork.jpg?itok=megpxniU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This unexpected roleplay has also led to the creation of "mini modules, mini story concepts to get you off to the start of your roleplaying. Instead of a dungeon here's a basic scenario, they'll be short. Something like one page to prompt your RP."</p>
<h2>Combat Scaling</h2>
<p>As the game carries on, and players drink and smoke more, they'll also be facing more and more monsters at a time. This leads to a variety of situations where different monster effects will work together to create a more challenging experience, leading to faster drinking.</p>
<p>Each of the monsters included in <em>Drunkards, Druggies, and Delinquents</em> is a classic monster that will be familiar to fans of high-fantasy and fantasy TTRPGs each with a pun name referencing alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>Asking how they balanced a game when a key component is a players ability to handle themselves while drinking/smoking Prynoski explained that they did try to test it with varying numbers of people but as they added more it got too complicated and they wanted to make sure that the game was still fun, especially when comprehending complicated rules might be difficult.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-backer-items.jpg?itok=SMQhabmc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-backer-items.jpg?itok=pgsvQFYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Backer Rewards And Alternate Ways To Play</h2>
<p>In the basic set you've got to roll up your own character, if you opt for the deluxe set it comes with 24 pre-rolled characters to lower the barrier of entry into playing to nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's a drinking and smoking game because we released it on 4/20 initially, we wanted to incorporate if you wanted to have an edible or puff on a [joint] we've also incorporated a sober mechanic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the sober options that the game suggests are push-ups or jumping jacks. "You don't have to be a drunk to play this game"</p>
<h2>A Distinct Art Style</h2>
<p>A key aspect that drew me to diving deeper into <em>Drunkards, Druggies, and Delinquents</em> was the incredible art. I asked if this was something they intended, or that they happened upon during development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-skinner.jpg?itok=G5cZ9olx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-interview-skinner.jpg?itok=-lSVLjKK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Well that's our core strength I think. We work with so many amazing artists and so many people in animation and illustration that it was a no brainer to bring on as many cool artists as possible. I think there's more we can do, especially since we've launched it. I'm fairly certain there will be expansion packs in the future for people who are interested, and we are talking about for Garycon next year to have a to-be-determined Garycon exclusive card, either a monster or a character class."</p>
<p>Part of one of the Delinquent level, the backer level before it "gets ridiculous', comes with a poster that Pyrnoski wanted to make sure to highlight to potential backers. It comes with a blacklight poster of the art used for the DM screen and "you just can't get the sense from the picture of how cool that is. It will be somewhere between 1.5-2x larger than the DM screen but it just looks phenomenal"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If there's a person who just likes crazy blacklight poster art and they know who the artist Skinner is just know that that poster looks so much cooler that it just doesn't come across when you're looking at a thumbnail."</p>
