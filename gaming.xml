They're doing it with gusto.</p>
<p>Indeed, players of DK's latest (and greatest?) adventure are already taking to the internet to proudly display entire areas that they've stripped of all destructible assets! And the game's only been out a few days (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level">Polygon</a>!).</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4knwuox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First up, and as seen on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2l7dt/i_dug_out_the_entirety_of_the_intro_cave/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://gonintendo.com/contents/50918-donkey-kong-bananza-players-have-already-completely-cleared-out-the-game-s-opening">u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one player has totally dug out everything in the opening intro cave, which is impressive!</p>

<p>However, we then have <a href="https://x.com/PJiggles_/status/1946730253281284099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1946730253281284099%7Ctwgr%5E99ce2a455c492436c389579c2f56f7d18dc43487%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdonkey-kong-bananza-player-smashes-entire-layer-flat%2F">another post on social media</a> that one-ups this by clearing out an entire ruddy map. Is anyone else getting a little twitchy at the idea of having to do this?</p>

<p>There's something horrifically moreish about destroying the levels in this game, there's no doubt about it. Even just smashing up stuff because it looks nice is a good time. As an example of this, we punched all of Void Co's faces off a rock sculpture early in the adventure, just because we could - and also because we hate those guys.</p>
<p>The player below, meanwhile, has shared a relaxing video in which they take the opportunity to ruin a very nice in-game store. Everything begins in a perfectly tranquil nature here, before DK finally gives up and does what he does best. Wrecks the place.</p>

<p>Ahhhhh. That's better! Look, if it's good enough for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-shigeru-miyamoto-did-exactly-what-we-did-when-playtesting-donkey-kong-bananza">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, then it's good enough for everyone!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Void Interactive has announced that its tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a pretty major sales milestone in just four days.</p>

<p><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer" rel="nofollow">released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> last week, and according to a press release, the game has already managed to sell a million copies on both platforms, a milestone it reached within the first four days of its launch.</p>

<p>As Void Interactive points out, when combined with the 9 million sales milestone&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">reached on PC earlier this year</a>, this means the game has managed to hit 10 million sales overall, which is a pretty impressive figure for a game that's proven pretty divisive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=VU4ZXcf3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=cckl7ckc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has hit a million sales on console.</figcaption></figure><p>Void CEO Julio&nbsp;Rodriguez says that it took 36 days for <i>Ready or Not&nbsp;</i>to reach a million sales on PC, but that it managed to achieve this milestone in a tenth of the time on console.</p>

<p>Rodriguez also says his studio is "already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience", so if you're not entirely satisfied with your&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>experience on console, there's every chance an update will be along soon to fix that.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused tactical shooter in which you must "defuse hostile and confronting situations" as a member of a SWAT team. You might be dealing with hostage situations, for instance, or you might be dispatched to a robbery, and working alongside your team to defuse such situations is key to the game's core.</p>




<p>Recently, the game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">come under fire</a> from its PC community for what players perceive as censorship being imposed on the PC version in order for the console releases to go ahead, as well as a perceived graphical downgrade for the PC version to achieve parity with console gamers.</p>

<p>Void Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarified</a> that&nbsp;changes were made to&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>in order to comply with "platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions", and that those changes were only made "where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations".</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ready-or-not/9NBR63PT4FZC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p>Bang bang. A Doom modder who's been busy recreating the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the setting for some irradiated boomer shooting has released a fresh trailer to the public for the first time in years.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin looks to have been quietly beavering away at GZDoom WAD Fallout: Bakersfield since releasing its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjJM9HAqqk">last teaser in 2022</a>, having posted fairly regular update blogs for supporters on his <a href="https://boosty.to/red888guns">Boosty profile</a>. For the rest of us, this fresh trailer's the best look we've gotten yet at what Berezin - who's worked on classic Fallout mods like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509613179">Olympus 2207</a> and <a href="https://cambragol.github.io/Fallout-Sonora/">Fallout: Sonora</a> - has been up to when not <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">doing stuff</a> for publishers New Blood Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the trailer, it kicks off with the sort of pullback through some ruins as fifties-ish music plays that I'm fairly sure you're mandated by law to include in all Fallouty things. Once we're in the shoes of our Vault Doomweller, the shootiness starts.</p>
<p>Roaming around the mod's version of the first Fallout game's Necropolis, you'll be shooting and stabbing away at hordes of ferals, as your face contorts and grimaces on a status bar that's very much the unholy Doollout/Falloom union that you'd hope.</p>

<p>There's a wonderful crunchiness to every attack, as enemies burst into piles of gore that'll make your average bloody mess perk taker erupt into squeals of pure ecstacy. Then, at the end, mirroring how the fight through the city of the dead in Fallout 1 goes, there's a showdown with Harry the Super Mutant. He thinks he's gonna beat your head now, and he might if you're not quick to start blasting.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like a really cool way to flip an old school Fallout sequence on its head. The mod is currently 60% done, all in all. Berezin breaks that down into four areas, with walls/tiles and scenery both being 80% of the way there, while weapons/UI and creatures are only 50 and 30% sorted respectively. There's no firm release date as of yet, with the modder only committing to getting Fallout: Bakersfield out there before the 2020s are over.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm happy to wait, and I'm not just saying that because it looks like Berezin's pretty handy at blowing  annoyances to bits with a beefy virtual shotgun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level]]></content:encoded>

I can’t really say for myself yet. To be honest, I haven’t really done much in Nintendo’s latest open-world reimagining of its iconic ape’s adventures. It’s not because I don’t want to, but because I, like several others, have found <em>Bananza </em>difficult to get through. This isn’t because of a difficult boss fight or tough platforming challenge, but because this game feels like the most expensive fidget toy I’ve ever held in my hands. The coolest thing about <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is also what makes it a pain in the ass: I’m talking about the destructible environment.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,197589,197586" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When I first booted up <em>Bananza</em>, I spent over an hour in the first room. No, not the first area, but the first <em>room</em> that Donkey Kong spawns into when you start a new playthrough. What was I doing in a mostly barren cave? I was beating the absolute shit out of the ceiling, floor, and walls in search of hidden packets of gold buried in the stone. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m not the only player</a></span> who has been captivated (perhaps unwillingly) by the act of giving the environment the ol’ one-two.</p><p>Nintendo made a big deal about how <em>Bananza</em>’s cave structures could be pounded into submission, potentially revealing new areas or treasures waiting for you on the other side. In this game, DK is effectively a miner in search of golden bananas, and it’s genuinely impressive just how thoroughly he’s able to excavate the world. It’s incredibly satisfying to just be able to pull a Stanley Yelnats and plunge into the ground below you whenever you feel so compelled. I can rip a stone off a cave wall and start slapping enemies around with it. DK climbs up walls and can tunnel through the ceiling like it’s nothing. Caves are often meant to feel restrictive in video games, but <em>Bananza</em> makes Donkey Kong a walking drill capable of making tunnel systems at the press of a button. It’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303">pretty impressive technical feat</a></span> on top of being a satisfying design space to play around in. But the problem is, being able to tear up the ground underneath you and find a bunch of shiny shit scratches my brain a little <em>too</em> well.</p><figure id="" data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was diagnosed with OCD last year, and while it’s not the stereotypical clean freak shit you often see depicted in media, it did give me context for some of my odder neurodivergent tendencies. As far as my gaming habits go, however, this was somewhat surprising to me because I’m not usually the completionist type who has to do every little side quest or task, and I generally don’t like games that feel like they’re wasting my time. <em>Bananza</em>, however, has found a way past that mental block and tapped into a more easily activated tendency by giving me a small taste of destruction that inevitably turns into me devouring a meal of demolition.</p><p>Walking through the environment in <em>Bananza</em> is like bee-bopping around in a minefield until I find a stray nugget of gold poking out of a wall. I punch the shiny rock out of the wall, but the wall keeps caving in with every subsequent punch, and every few swings, another piece of gold comes tumbling out of the rubble. Sometimes an entire geyser of gold erupts from the stone, and I can’t simply leave to go to the next area when there could be another one of those waiting for me inside a stalagmite I have yet to pummel. Then, by the time I’ve really gotten into the rhythm of digging around, I realize that I’ve left a lot of destruction in my wake and have lost an hour or so of my day and accomplished nothing.</p><figure id="" data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have always considered myself firmly a “goal-oriented” player, and that means I tend to like linear games more than the open-world glut of a lot of modern AAA projects. I get agitated when I feel like I’m not doing something and making real progress, and that discomfort with idle time means I’m usually the type of person who will do a few side quests, but hold off on a lot of the extracurricular stuff until I’ve seen the main quest through. In most video games, these alternate activities are sequestered enough down different pathways that I can keep my mind on my primary goal and come back to them later. With <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, however, the alternate path is underneath my feet with every step. Everything I do chips away at the walls of the cave system, and every inch I break through might lead me to treasure, or at least make a really satisfying crushing sound. I’ll see the end eventually, but y’all go ahead. I’ll catch up after I’ve left no stone unturned.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Despite receiving generally positive reviews, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft, and the company blames the "choppy waters" around the Star Wars IP at the time for the game's disappointing performance. Speaking to shareholders during a Q&amp;A session of its 2025 general meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot referenced the Star Wars brand and how recent projects had tarnished it.</p><p>"Outlaws was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters," Guillemot said (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). Leading up to the release of Star Wars Outlaws, the IP had experienced turbulence with the poorly received Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker movie, the polarizing TV series The Acolyte, and the mixed reception to The Book of Boba Fett.</p>

      </div>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">Outlaws was also criticized at the time</a>, as the combination of a badly paced intro mission, various technical issues, and several bugs didn't sit too well with players. Most of these issues have been addressed since the game launched last year, and the story of protagonist Kay Vess has continued with two DLC expansions, Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune.</p><p>While it's unclear if Ubisoft will ever venture back into the Star Wars galaxy--especially now that it has a new division focused on its tentpole IP <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront/" data-ref-id="5000-183978">and led by Guillemot's own son</a>, Charlie Guillemot--there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917"> several Star Wars games in development at other studios</a>.</p><p>Saber Interactive says that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">Knights of the Old Republic remake isn't dead</a>, Skydance New Media is working on its own untitled Star Wars project, and turn-based tactics fans can look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6530993/" data-ref-id="1100-6530993">Star Wars: Zero Company</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim warned of the scam posts and advised followers not to interact.</p>
<p>"The official Stellar Blade account has been compromised, and unauthorised posts containing cryptocurrency airdrops and suspicious signup promotions are currently being uploaded," said the director on Saturday via his personal account.</p>

Now, the Spearow-eyed Joe Merrick of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://serebii.net/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://serebii.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Serebii</em></a></span> has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3lufiuhjqq22w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3lufiuhjqq22w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a></span> that due to a slip-up by the official Korean Pokémon YouTube channel, we know that this edition will be a lengthy 24 minutes.</p><p>But 24 minutes of what?

Except, for reasons never announced, that’s not happened—we’re experiencing our first four-year gap in the franchise in ages. (God, I <em>hope</em> it’s just four years.) And while <em>Z-A</em> is looking intriguing, and we’ll definitely get a good look at it again tomorrow, one thing it isn’t going to do is add any new Pokémon to the roster.</p><p>So could this Presents be hiding some sort of tease for Gen X? I wish I could believe that, but I have my doubts. If there is going to be a new mainline game next year, all of history suggests it won’t be until around October, and starting reveals over a year early seems unlikely. Still, it’d be good!</p><p>What’s more likely is we’ll get updates for the array of <em>Pokémon</em> games already out there, including <em>Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, <em>Sleep</em> and the rest, as well as reveals for perhaps a couple of new mobile apps and games, and maybe a new multiplayer game. Oh, and something about <em>Horizons</em> season 2, perhaps. Perhaps more on the new season of the wonderful stop-motion <em>Concierge.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The stream will start tomorrow, July 22, at 9 a.m. EDT, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/pokemon&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the official YouTube channel</a></span>. And intriguingly, if you tune into the Japanese channel an hour earlier, there’s apparently going to be an hour of DJ Pikachu Live? I have no idea. But it could well be promoting a surprise reveal of a DJ-based game in the main event.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legend-z-a-youtube-dj-pikachu-1851786626]]></content:encoded>

These are likely references to cosmetics, as Call of Duty's online multiplayer is known for its raft of weed-themed DLC.

The description also states that the campaign story will involve players trying to "prevent a tech titan from gaining power."</p><p>"Battles are realistic and frenetic, highlighted by gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Some levels allow players to engage in execution moves/sequences (e.g., repeatedly stabbing a foe in the chest, throat, torso). Some weapons cause characters to explode into bloody chunks of flesh," the description says.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, the two main co-developers of 2024's Black Ops 6.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a> is getting another DLC expansion in the form of '<strong>The Namco Legendary Pack DLC</strong>'.</p>
<p>No release date has been set at the time of writing, but the new DLC will contain an additional timeline looking at Namco's history with Atari, along with multiple playable versions of <strong>Atari PAC-MAN</strong>, <strong>GALAGA</strong>, <strong>GALAXIAN</strong>, <strong>DIG DUG</strong>, and <strong>XEVIOUS</strong>.</p>
<p>You can expect a whole load of new photos, archival material, videos, and interviews, with the trailer highlighting more footage from the interview between Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell and current CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 3 Atari PAC-MAN games: PAC-MAN 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit. This marks the first ever re-release of these games for consoles.</p>
<p>- Interactive timeline exploring the history of Namco titles on Atari consoles featuring video interviews with developers, archival materials and documents, photos from the era, and more.</p>
<p>- The U.S. arcade versions of DIG DUG and XEVIOUS, developed by Namco in Japan and originally released by Atari, re-released in this form for the first time ever.</p>
<p>- Home console versions of GALAGA, XEVIOUS, GALAXIAN, and DIG DUG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not all, though. For the Atari enthusiasts out there, the company has also announced an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP3JZ1RMdEA">Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition</a>, featuring a custom design based on the Pac-Man IP with a bonus double-feature game including the brand-new Pac-Man 7800 and the original Pac-Man 2600.</p>
<p>The cartridge will also be made available separately, or via a new '<a href="https://atari.com/products/high-score-collection-7800">High-Score Collection set</a>', which includes all aforementioned games for either the Atari 2600+ or Atari 7800+ (or, indeed, the original 7800).</p>
<p>Atari 50 has already been expanded with two additional DLC packs; one looking at 'The Wider World of Atari', and the other looking at 'The First Console War'.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast Final Hands-On (PC) Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview.1248734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of a world tour leading up to the launch of their latest entry in the zombie survival/parkour action series, Techland recently invited Wccftech and a small number of other content creators and journalists out to California to go hands-on with the opening hours of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While our earlier preview was focused on the protagonist Kyle Crane coming to terms with his newfound Beast powers, this session was more intimate, instead centered around the opening hours of the adventure in Castor Peaks (minus the introductory moments where Kyle breaks free from his decade-long captivity). You could consider these where Kyle Crane slowly gets his groove back, returning to the freerunning zombie slayer he once was.</p>



<p>Castor Peaks represents a much needed change in scenery from the concrete jungles of prior Dying Light games. While there are still scattered settlements with tightly clustered buildings to parkour across, much of the landscape is filled with nature and untouched areas free from human influence. Given Castor Peaks’ status as a nature conservation, this fits the setting and builds out the world into more of a playground where Kyle Crane can let his inner beast truly run wild.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given that Dying Light: The Beast carries off a decade from the original Dying Light, there has clearly been the passage of time where the protagonist wasn’t working on his wallclimbing or hammer throwing. In proper open-world gameplay fashion, this leads the player into a series of tutorial segments meant to both onboard the player and return Kyle Crane back to fighting condition. This means the usual gamut of learning how to wield a melee weapon as well as where and how to climb around the environment. White paint splashed across ledges and open windows serve as pathways for the player to traverse and thankfully they blend well enough into the backdrop of Castor Peaks that one might not even notice they’re present unless actively looking for them.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast’s parkour system still takes some getting used to the intricate jankiness to truly appreciate. While it’s true that Kyle Crane can climb up and mantle over just about anything with a flat surface, some of the more puzzling sections can be an exercise in patience. Rather than moving and clamboring at the speed I’d want to move, sometimes I found myself needing to stop and look over at the ledge I wanted to mantle over to and wait for Kyle to stretch his arm out and indicate that he was locked onto the ledge and by jumping, he would automatically reach for it. There were a number of high stakes moments where the sense of urgency was pulled back by needing to wait for the precision to climb above. Given that Dying Light: The Beast is still an RPG at its core with a robust skill tree, I anticipate seeing some new abilities pop up that will mitigate my concerns with the traversal.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the same time, combat is the other key pillar to what makes the Dying Light series. Played out entirely in first-person (minus the third-person cutscenes and menus), players will experience the visceral combat through the eyes of Kyle Crane. Whether wielding a one- or two-handed weapon or firearm, zombies are constantly on the move for the protagonist’s flesh and won’t stop until their head is knocked clean off. Dying Light: The Beast features an overhauled dismemberment system and there is a gratuitous amount of gore as Kyle swings away with any implement he can get his hands on. And yes, once again, weapon durability is a constant stuggle to maintain but now that Kyle Crane has been around an apocalypse or two before, he’s skilled enough to repair his weapons on the go with a fair bit of scrap metal and other materials he’s scavenged up. No more having to trade out broken pipes every 90 seconds just because you tried to take on an entire zombie horde instead of taking the high road to run away.</p>

<p>As this session of Dying Light: The Beast was focused on the early hours of Kyle Crane’s revenge story, many of the more interesting upgrades and Beast powers were locked away for players to rediscover. One thing’s for certain though: years of captivity have turned Kyle Crane into a raging beast.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will launch on August 22nd, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC for $59.99/$69.99 or as a free standalone DLC for those who purchased the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a> series has always held a special place in the zombie genre. After all, it was one of the first, if not the first, to implement parkour and make it a vital part of surviving. Thankfully, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> follows the same formula that fans have come to expect while building upon the game's overall story. Ahead of the game's launch, Tech Raptor was recently invited to a hands-on preview event where we got to play a little over four hours of the upcoming game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> breaks the trend of playing as a new character. Instead, players are once again in the boots of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca6b8cd3-8473-4246-ba44-281fcce108ac" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-bad-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a>. But things are a bit different this time around. Due to a series of experiments on him, Crane now has superhuman-like abilities called Beast Mode that allow him to murder anything around him easily. The only way to activate it was by building a bar that would only fill when you attacked someone. If timed right, Beast Mode can help out in the heat of battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=bNFrlgkd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=dXWvRq8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This takes Beast Mode to a whole new meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>My demo opened up with Crane running through the woods into a mansion. I noticed early on that The Beast does a great job of blending Urban environments with Nature. There'll be a lot of times where you'll find yourself running through the woods and have nothing to climb onto or jump on. This was a new direction to take the series because, in previous titles, you always had some kind of roof or ledge from which you could jump when needed.</p>

<p>At first, this may not sound like a good idea on paper, but it adds an extra layer of fear in the game. Because in many ways, you're now exposed, and it requires you to think quickly, if not, you run the risk of getting swarmed by a horde of zombies. To combat this, Techland introduced 4x4 trucks that you can drive in certain map regions. Admittedly, though I found myself avoiding cars because of how unreliable they can be, because of how it can get stuck in ditches or in a street filled with abandoned cars, running around proved to be the better method nine times out of ten.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=8Quo17_K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=Kwz4tieN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nothing like the great outdoors... and zombies.</figcaption></figure><p>Once I entered the mansion and fought through a small group of zombies, I was immediately ambushed by a larger-than-life zombie called Chimera. These are essentially lab-created super zombies that are in Beast Mode 24/7.</p>

<p>Throughout my demo, I fought a small handful of Chimera, and each had its own unique fight. Despite that, they all shared a few common traits. Like Souls-like games, each boss has a second phase, and once you get to it, their moveset would drastically change, and throughout the fight, they would eventually call for backup, and you'd be forced to fight regular zombies while dealing with trying not to get killed by the boss.</p>

<p>As fun and engaging as these fights were, they all handicapped themselves because of how beefy the bosses were. A lot of the time, it felt as if my hits weren't doing too much damage, and this caused nearly all of the fights to drag on longer than I would have liked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=WkYkA_tT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=U5poB19t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These zombies are about to catch these hands.</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing worth pointing out is some of the tropes implemented in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. As I progressed through the story, I was eventually greeted by a woman who betrayed the game's main antagonist. The issue that stood out to me was that it followed an old 2000s trope of having an attractive blonde woman help this dark and broody man through the powers of science, because she couldn't defend or accomplish what she wanted to do herself. It felt odd then and odd now to see such dated clichés being played out again in 2025. But that's where a lot of my complaints begin and end.</p>

<p>Although many of the story beats I got were extremely limited to the small section I was playing, it offered an interesting twist. In short, Crane is looking to get revenge on the man who experimented on him, and to do this, he has to gain the trust of local survivors to ensure he'll have enough manpower to do so. But that wasn't the part that stood out to me. The Beast makes it clear that the big bad of this game is, by all accounts, a monster and someone who lost their humanity in hopes of gaining power. But to take him down, Crane has to become a monster himself, literally.</p>

<p>This is done by mixing his DNA with the dead Chimeras you kill along the way. This proposed a unique question: "How much of yourself can you sell, before you lose your humanity?" Obviously, this question wasn't answered in the few hours I played, but it left me wondering how the bigger picture would unfold.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=8TFALs55 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=gDJI6oDO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Am I a man... Or am I a monster?</figcaption></figure><p>One thing that caught me off guard was the improved combat system. Sure, shooting a bow and gun feels good, but at its core, <em>Dying Light</em> has always been a guerrilla survival game in the sense that just about anything can be a melee weapon. In <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, swinging a weapon around feels a lot more authentic. Seeing the difference in animations between lighting one-handed blades and two-handed hammers was something I appreciated, even more so when I found myself in tight environments, because this forced my character to use these in unique ways that still felt realistic.</p>

<p>In keeping things realistic, The Beast didn't shy away from the gore this time. As I was hacking and slashing through zombies, I immediately saw the effects my weapons were having. For example, every time I would hit a zombie in the face, I would see their flesh and skull open more and more with each hit. Or if I went for a gut attack, their intestines would come flying out.</p>

<p>The nice cherry on top of this was how precise arm attacks would be. I found myself testing how accurate it was. If I used a blade and swung at the hand only, the hand would fall off, but if I hit the elbow, then the bottom half of the arm would fall off. This nice attention to detail helps sell how grim and dark the world of <em>Dying Light</em> is.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=T6lGITMx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=jEQU-Zia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hack and slash.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, some of <em>Dying Light's</em> core parts are the parkour and Day and Night systems. I'm happy to report that both are as fun and engaging as ever. Like the other Dyling Light games, the world still feels like a massive sandbox. This makes running from rooftop to rooftop even more fun because the game encourages you to run around and find hidden paths that make getting around much easier.</p>

<p>When night hits, the rules of the game are flipped once again. Although it's still possible to be aggressive and hunt down zombies, it's not the best idea. This is mainly because this is one of the only times Volatiles come out, and fighting them is never an easy task. But what's interesting is if you happen to get spotted by one, it'll create a unique sequence that lets you know how many Volatiles are actively trying to kill you. If you have a Volatile chasing you, more will appear, and the hunt for you will be even more challenging to survive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-17.jpg?itok=vx4QnnF2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-17.jpg?itok=EzVAh6ey 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you survivethe night?</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, my time with <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was fun. If you've played any of the games, you can pick up a controller and understand it almost instantly. Although it feels similar to the first two <em>Dying Light</em> games, it captures the charm of what makes them so enjoyable while improving many core features that help take the game in a new direction. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will be released on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep&nbsp;</em>developer The Chinese Room has announced that it's splitting from parent company Sumo Group, following layoffs at the latter earlier this year.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, the British studio's management has bought the studio in order to make it independent. Prior to the buyout, The Chinese Room's future had been uncertain; in February, Sumo Group said it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">focus more on "development services for partners"</a> rather than original work, although the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>would come under that heading.</p>

<p>The Chinese Room says that its sale to a third party was looking "increasingly likely" before the buyout, and that becoming independent will not only allow it to "work on new, original intellectual property", but also to "partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with [the studio's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=4nvtcGzZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=19BVgUmW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Chinese Room is working on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to IGN's report, The Chinese Room is now working on two brand new IPs, but before those see the light of day, the studio will be releasing the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>later this year.</p>

<p>Back in March, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">once again delayed</a>, this time to October. It's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a number of times <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">before</a>, but given that The Chinese Room was only announced as the game's developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">back in September 2023</a>, it's entirely possible a lot of the earlier work on the game was thrown out when that development change happened.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, The Chinese Room hasn't been resting on its laurels. Earlier this year, the studio released a paid DLC pack for its narrative horror game&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" rel="nofollow">released in June last year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-beast</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-the-beast.1248728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, TechRaptor was invited to a hands-on preview where we played the game for a handful of hours. On top of hacking and slashing the army of the dead, we also got to sit down and chat with Tymon Smektala, the franchise director for the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light</a></em> series, about where the team draws inspiration from and where the series can go from here.</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes about <em>The Beast</em> in comparison to previous games is that a large portion of the game takes place in the woods, where there are few to no areas for players to use parkour to help them get out of a tricky situation. Smektala explains that they wanted to try this out and see if they could take the series to a new location and still feel authentic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=cDiOMGjk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=h6cdHukz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go and touch some grass.</figcaption></figure><p>"We wanted to see if we could have a <em>Dying Light</em> game where we could [occasionally] take away parkour. What we discovered is that it works very well for us because, in a way, parkour is a survival mechanic. You can use it to get away quickly. [Taking away parkour] even adds to the survival aspect because suddenly you feel more exposed and fragile against threats. It adds a lot of tension," Smektala said.</p>

<p>Many survival-horror games involve players running for their lives, but the latest installment of <em>Dying Light</em> introduces a new mechanic called "Beast Mode." In short, this makes you an unstoppable force of nature that can kill just about everything in your path. Smektala told TechRaptor that this was implemented so they could give players a fighting chance when they find themselves overwhelmed by zombies. The idea of having this second wind stemmed from an unlikely game… <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bcdf3e0e-b246-4766-a64d-4a145078a64f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-labyrinth-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow">Pac-Man</a></em>.</p>

<p>"It's kind of the same setup. You feel very fragile because when the ghosts are chasing you, all they need to do is touch you, and you'll die. But when you grab the power pellet, that's when you turn the tables. [Beast Mode] is the same mechanic, and in <em>Pac-Man</em>, the uncertainty of not knowing if you'd reach the power pellet adds to the excitement like in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>," Smektala said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=u7FiIdsl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=JYbWRXAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to eat some Power Pellets.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in our recent preview, a prominent theme of <em>The Beast</em> is the main character literally becoming a beast to stop someone who's metaphorically a beast. This idea largely stemmed from a Korean film called <em>Old Boy</em>.</p>

<p>The film explores similar themes and shares similar story beats of a person being captured for years, and once they escape, they set out to kill everyone who has wronged them. But <em>Old Boy</em> wasn't the only piece of media that helped inspire <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. Smektala went on to cite shows such as <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow">Stranger Things</a> </em>as also playing a huge role in setting the narrative location for the upcoming game.</p>

<p>"Both take place in those little towns, where they are [cut off from] the outside world, and the outside world doesn't matter," he said. "It all happens within this town, and a lot of very weird and strange things transpire."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=wB3qR7F1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=V-NPwWbJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Parkour!</figcaption></figure><p>Zombie fans may quickly notice how much the game draws inspiration from the <em>28 </em>movie trilogy. This can be seen in the music, scenery, and chases players encounter. When asked if the team used the movie series as a point of reference, Smektala said that Techland views <em>Dying Light</em> as "[one of the] top games in the zombie genre." But the <em>28 </em>series has been a big inspiration for Techland, and he discussed how both series have gone down similar paths.</p>

<p>"All of those movies try to do something different. If you compare <em>28 Days Later </em>and <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, they are completely different movies. Again, <em>28 Years Later</em> is very different when compared to the first two," Smektala said. "What happens in those movies is very similar to what we are doing with <em>Dying Light</em>. <em>28 Days Later</em> was a very intimate movie with mostly one character in a very empty space, where he was feeling weak against zombies. This was a similar feeling to the early hours of <em>Dying Light 1</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=C5rC4OyL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=TrwvJAuc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fight the dead, fear the living.</figcaption></figure><p>"When you look at <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, it's much more focused on action. With people in big action sequences, people shooting guns, and a lot more blockbuster moments. This is the same with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a></em>. This was our action game; it was focused on big moments. Now, <em>28 Years Later</em>, is a different story that is similar to <em>The Beast</em>, because it's very experimental in a way. A lot of weird things are happening in <em>28 Years Later</em>, as in <em>The Beast</em>."</p>

<p>Speaking of a lot of weird things happening, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> introduces a new zombie variant called Chimeras. Smektala said that introducing a new zombie variant can always be difficult because they don't want to lean too far out of the world of realism. So the Chimeras came from the idea of "something that could have happened if you applied proper science to it." That's where a lot of the visual inspiration came into play.</p>

<p>"When it comes to the design of the Chimeras, two main sources of inspiration are anatomy books. The second one is an anime series called <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa17d54b-1887-4176-82c7-9f626553cc5f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/attack-on-titan-2" rel="nofollow">Attack on Titan</a></em>, which has those types of monsters that are skinless with all of their bodies exposed. That informed the visual designs for the Chimera," he said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=v88fsavZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=_rNtwCqj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chimera or Titan?</figcaption></figure><p>One final piece of information that long-time franchise fans may be excited to hear is that <em>The Beast</em> is supposed to set the canon for the franchise going forward, and it takes place after the first two installments. This is notable because every <em>Dying Light</em> game has multiple endings, and it's left up to the player to decide what ending they want. But according to Smektala, <em>The Beast</em> will have one ending because the team wanted "to set the canon for the universe."</p>

<p>Smektala even teased that The Beast's ending will "answer several questions from both the first and second game." <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will release on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now in it’s 12th year, the free-t0-play loot shooter <em>Warframe</em> is still going strong and the future looks bright coming off a whirlwind series of announcements and teases from TennoCon 2025. The multi-day event included details on new story expansions, new frames, and access to an alpha build for Digital Extremes’ fantasy spin-off, <em>Soulframe</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196181" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There was also an update on <em>Warframe</em> for mobile, which is getting a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warframe.com/android&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closed beta this fall</a></span>, and of course every new <em>Warframe</em> expansion gets a new kick-ass song, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKo04oNQ9k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKo04oNQ9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this year’s included</a></span>. Here are the five biggest takeaways from the annual fan extravaganza. </p><h2 id="h260190"><a id=""></a>Unannounced fall 2025 update will finally explain <em>Warframe</em>’s convoluted mod process to new players</h2><figure id="" data-id="3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframes appear in art for the fall season.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Warframe</em>, like <em>Destiny</em>, is practically ancient by modern live-service gaming standards now, and it has acquired a number of systems that have become second nature to ongoing players but inscrutable to newcomers. One of those is the mod system, which features a lot of customization and crafting. </p><p>While Digital Extremes hasn’t dished on what its big fall update will include (more info is coming in a devstream on September 25), we do know it will have a new quest called Teacher that will onboard players to the game’s most important buildcrafting tool. Hopefully it’s a good onramp for everyone still looking for one. </p><h2 id="h260191"><a id=""></a>The next story chapter is called<em> The Old Peace</em></h2><p><em>Warframe</em>’s next expansion drops near the end of 2025 and will take players into the past to witness the game’s “most tectonic historical event,” known as “The Old War.” It’ll feature a visual overhaul to player controlled Tenno Operators and WWI-inspired trench warfare. </p><p>It’ll include a playable Excalibur Prime for one of the quests, Caliban Prime, new Sentient allies and enemies, the devil-inspired Warframe Uriel, and two new Protoframes. Most importantly, it’ll set the stage for something the game has never done before.</p><h2 id="h260192"><a id=""></a>2026 will takes players to the distant Tau star system</h2><p>Following the events of <em>The Old Peace</em>, players will, for the first time in Warframe’s history, be taken to the new Tau star system. It was a target for colonization within the game’s fiction long ago, with self-replicating terraforming machines called Sentients tasked with preparing Tau for inhabitation. What will await players there next year is anybody’s guess. </p><h2 id="h260193"><a id=""></a><em>Soulframe</em> is still years away but fans went hands-on with an early test build called <em>Preludes</em></h2><p>In addition to continuing <em>Warframe</em>’s legacy, Digital Extremes has also been busy with the fantasy-based spin-off <em>Soulframe</em>. An extended demo during TennoCon 2025 showed character customization and a player tracking a monster through the woods, using a combination of melee weapons, archer, and spells to survive various woodland threats. While fans were able to try out the pre-alpha <em>Preludes</em> build over the weekend, a lasting free demo sounds a bit farther away. </p><p>Will the game be ready before the end of 2025? That’s sounding less and less likely.  “It’s an aspirational goal,” community manager Sarah Asselin told fans during a Q&amp;A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the weekend</a></span>. “We’re looking at where we’re at by the end of the year, but we want to feel confident that we’ve built<em> Soulframe</em> out to the point where it feels good to do so, for the players and the developers.” </p><h2 id="h260194"><a id=""></a><em>Warframe</em>’s devs would love to make a Switch 2 version but still haven’t received a dev kit from Nintendo</h2><figure id="" data-id="eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-recommend-id="image://eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-format="png" data-width="1186" data-height="669" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframe characters appear on a Switch 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fortnite</em>,<em> No Man’s Sky</em>, and other Switch 1 ports have started receiving upgrades for Switch 2. Will <em>Warframe</em>, which could certainly benefit from better performance on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid device, be getting a similar treatment? Not until Nintendo gives Digital Extremes a Switch 2 dev kit, apparently. Like lots of other big third-party developers, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kbl11o/official_source_nintendo_switch_2_dev_kits_are/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kbl11o/official_source_nintendo_switch_2_dev_kits_are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s still waiting for the hardware</a></span>. </p><p> “Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” CEO Steve Sinclair said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/tennocon-2025-everything-revealed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tennocon-2025-everything-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Q&amp;A</a></span>. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone…just one, that’s all it would take. I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for <em>Warframe</em>. Absolutely.” </p><p>We’ll see what ends up coming out first: <em>Warframe</em>’s Switch 2 upgrade or <em>Soulframe</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warframe-soulsframe-switch-2-tau-trailer-tennocon-2025-1851786622]]></content:encoded>

Supposedly even bigger companies like Capcom and Sega are still waiting for more access to the devices, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after a decade, Warframe is still one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-games/2900-5406/">the 25 best free games to play</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> released last week, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-climbs-to-top-of-uk-physical-sales-charts-but-still-sells-less-than-half-of-mario-odyssey">proven a popular addition to the Switch 2's library</a>.</p>
<p>But, while the base game itself has been met with plenty of praise, its inclusion of an artist mode has also tickled many peoples' fancy. This mode is somewhat reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>'s interactive menu, and lets players sculpt their own creations out of rock by using the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s mouse controls.</p>
<p>Creations so far have included fellow famous Nintendo faces such as Luigi, as well as carved works showing Banjo of Banjo-Kazooie fame, and even a <a href="https://x.com/michaeljhaley/status/1947011457373335896">Star Wars Death Star</a>. Others have taken things even further, and a little darker, and sculpted DK's crucifixion. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not has surpassed 1 million copies sold on consoles, just four days after its console launch, which brings the game's total sales past 10 million, after it hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">9 million copies sold on PC earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach 1 million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days. I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve accomplished together. It’s a huge moment — and one we don’t take for granted,</em>" said developer and publisher VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, in a press release. "<em>Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience. To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project — thank you.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ready or Not passes 1 million copies sold on consoles. Image credit: VOID Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>VOID Interactive's chief operating officer and creative director, Stirling Rank, added, "<em>The response from console players has completely blown us away. Going from the days of excitement from our Early Access trailer blowing up on PC to seeing the community grow globally so much across platforms &nbsp;is humbling, but &nbsp;testament to the incredible dedication of the entire VOID Interactive team to make this vision a reality for Ready or Not.</em>"</p>



<p>While the console launch has quickly been the next chapter of success in Ready or Not's story, it's also been another chapter marked with controversy. The console release came with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">update and changes</a> that some players considered to be censorship, with certain aspects of gore, nudity, and violence changed in both the console and PC versions of the game. VOID Interactive maintains that the changes were "<em>to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies."</em></p>



<p>VOID Interactive has always emphasized that Ready or Not is a "<em>hyper-realistic tactical FPS,"</em> and the changes ranging from victims in one level being nude, to now being partially clothed, to a child no longer appearing as having been dismembered post-mortem seem to clash with what players believed the original vision of the game to be. </p>



<p>While players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">Steam have taken to review-bombing</a> the game to show their displeasure, it's clear that this uproar hasn't had an overtly negative impact on sales. If you're also dissatisfied with the changes, a player released a mod that reverts the changes to how the game was pre-console launch just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-or-not-modder-retcons-censorship-changes-within-an-hour-of-new-patch-going-live">20 minutes after the update went live</a>.</p>

Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features.

            <title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Donkey Kong Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games.1248700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being Nintendo’s original mascot and being one of legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto’s most iconic character creations, Donkey Kong has had a bit of a weird history of getting his own video games compared to that mustachioed plumber he’s frequently feuding with. Sometimes he’s the hero. Sometimes he’s the villain. Sometimes he’s a bongo drummer. But with Donkey Kong Bananza out now - DK’s first new starring role in over a decade and first new 3D platformer in over 25 years - it’s time to ride a rickety minecart down memory lane and look back at the big ape’s greatest games. Here are the ten best Donkey Kong games of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-3-1753093410807.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble (an admittedly strange name for the third game in a series) isn’t exactly a game where you play as Donkey Kong himself, it does continue to build on the momentum based platforming gameplay that kicked off with the first Donkey Kong Country. Double Trouble tags in Dixie Kong and her cousin Kiddy Kong for another adventure, bringing more collectible coins, rideable animal sidekicks, and incredibly catchy background songs along with them. New abilities like Dixie’s ponytail hover (which feels similar to Tails’ foxtail helicopter hover seen in the Sonic games) add some interesting new mechanics to the mix, and while Double Trouble doesn’t quite reach the heights of its predecessors, it’s still an excellent and occasionally tough as nails adventure on its own and one of the best looking games on the Super Nintendo. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Donkey Kong 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk64-1753093280987.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong’s first (and until recently, only) foray into joystick-controlled platforming wasn’t quite as strong as when Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda’s Link made the jump from 2D games on the Super Nintendo to 3D games on the N64, but hey, those were the early days of 3D gaming and there were bound to be some growing pains. Donkey Kong 64 is often derided for its over abundance of often tedious collectibles but when levels open up and progression requirements get out of your way, it’s an absolute blast to explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DK 64’s main hook is allowing players to control an entire family of Kongs for the first time instead of splitting them off into duos like the Donkey Kong Country series was known for. There are a ton of levels to hop around in, secret areas to unlock, and seemingly endless things to collect, plus a bonus multiplayer mode where Kongs run around shooting each other with guns, which may seem strange until you remember Donkey Kong 64 was made by Rare, the same company known for reinventing console multiplayer shooters two years earlier with their hit game GoldenEye 007. However, ask any kid who grew up playing Donkey Kong 64 and they’ll tell you their two fondest memories have nothing to do with the gameplay itself. First, the bright banana yellow cartridge the game was released on, and second and most importantly, the DK Rap theme song, possibly the catchiest title screen music in the history of video games. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk-jb-1753093543875.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">During the GameCube era Nintendo experimented with a bunch of offbeat peripherals, but one of the strangest (and most adorable) were the DK Bongos, a large plastic pair of drums shaped like wooden barrels. The DK Bongos were most famously used for a series of rhythm games known as Donkey Konga, inviting players to smack the bongos in time with the beat to various songs. But the real star of the bongo supported GameCube game library was Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, a side scrolling platforming game that used bongo inputs to control Donkey Kong across a wide variety of stages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By smacking the bongos individually or together, Donkey Kong can move around, interact with objects, and beat the bananas out of a ton of different enemies and bosses. And while Jungle Beat is a bit on the short side, players were encouraged to replay it to beat their high scores over and over again. Jungle Beat eventually made its way to the Nintendo Wii and Wii U with updated Wiimote motion controls so here’s hoping it gets ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 so more players can finally experience this often forgotten modern classic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Donkey Kong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk-arcade-1753093638939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Donkey Kong game is still one of the greatest arcade games ever made, even decades later. At the time of its release in 1981, Nintendo was struggling to connect with arcade audiences and fast tracked a new game from then unknown game developer Shigeru Miyamoto. The result was the Kong Kong inspired Donkey Kong game, a unique arcade experience that showcased multiple levels, challenging platforming gameplay, and a little guy named Jumpman, now known around the world as Super Mario. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong was not only a massive hit for Nintendo, it also inspired two increasingly stranger arcade sequels, Donkey Kong Jr and Donkey Kong 3. It also served as the basis for the hit film King of Kong which documents the real life feud between two Donkey Kong high score world champions. For being a 40+ year old arcade game, the first Donkey Kong game ever made still holds up well today and brought the world Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline. Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if they let some Mario developers make a game with Donkey Kong and Pauline! Well, more on that in a bit.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Donkey Kong Country</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-1753093816318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to express just how revolutionary Donkey Kong Country was when it first came to the Super Nintendo in 1994. For starters, DKC was a total reinvention of Donkey Kong, his world, and his enemies. It gave us Diddy Kong, Donkey’s acrobatic sidekick who went on to appear in tons more games, including a few of his own. It featured groundbreaking pre-rendered graphics based on scans of 3D assets and an amazing soundtrack to boot. It gave us the Kremlings and King R. Rool and a bunch of other huge bosses. And it gave us Cranky Kong, Funky Kong, and Candy Kong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Country was a massive success, spawning several sequels as well as Game Boy and Game Boy Advance ports and remakes. It’s absolutely packed with diverse environments, tricky platforming, animal sidekicks, and collectibles and the minecart levels are still tense and challenging to this day. At the time it was incredibly rare (pun intended) for Nintendo to outsource one of their most important characters to a UK-based studio instead of just making a game in house but the result was a redefining of Donkey Kong that still impacts how he’s seen today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc2-1753093922620.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you do with Donkey Kong after the groundbreaking Donkey Kong Country? Well, you lock him in a cage so he can be rescued by Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong, obviously. Coming out just one year after the original, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest improved on nearly everything from the first game and cemented itself as the best game in the original trilogy. The levels are tougher and more clever, the graphics are better, the soundtrack is somehow even catchier, and the two playable characters are a ton of fun to control. There are dozens and dozens of secrets and collectibles to unearth across its eight vast worlds and 52 levels and finding them allows players to ultimately display a “102%” next to their save file.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Donkey Kong Country Returns</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2010/10/14/donkey-kong-country-returns-20101014073207929-3333506.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After Microsoft bought Donkey Kong Country creators Rare, the Donkey Kong games series was in a bit of a strange place. But 16 years to the day since the original Donkey Kong Country was released, Donkey Kong Country... well, returned again with Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Nintendo Wii, this time being developed by Metroid Prime creator Retro Studios. Returns was less of a total overhaul for the series and more of a return to form but it still managed to bring along a ton of new features and some seriously brilliant level design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Returns featured a totally new and distinct art direction for the series which also allowed the characters and world to be much more expressive and fun. Equally inventive were the stages and locales which were teeming with life and personality and more importantly, challenging and rewarding platforming, chaotic autoscrolling levels, and more. Donkey Kong Country Returns sold over 6.5 million copies on the Nintendo Wii and has been ported to every Nintendo handheld and console since. It’s a master class in how to bring a once dormant series back, a thing that Donkey Kong seems to have a habit of doing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Donkey Kong ‘94</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-94-1753094034300.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original arcade game, you don’t actually play as Donkey Kong in the Game Boy’s incredible Donkey Kong ‘94 even though his name is in the title. But that’s not the only thing those games share in common. Like his first game, Donkey Kong has once again captured Pauline, leaving Mario to jump and hammer his way to her rescue. But after a clever revisit of the Donkey Kong arcade four levels, Donkey Kong ‘94 opens up ninety seven more stages full of platform puzzle challenges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of how much fun Mario is to control, one of the best parts of Donkey Kong ‘94 is how expressive and charismatic Donkey Kong is here. He’s big and hulking and tough but also funny and goofy and seeing so much personality shine through the tiny and blurry original Game Boy screen was revelatory. The game saw a ton of spiritual successors in the Mario vs Donkey Kong series and spinoffs, although none were ever quite as good as Donkey Kong ‘94. Here’s hoping it gets a remake someday, but for now it’s totally accessible through the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy app and it absolutely still feels great to play.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/06/11/wiiudkcountryscrn04e3jpg-30b8fb.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Diddy’s Kong Quest, Tropical Freeze once again took all of the solid foundation laid down in the game before it and built an even bigger and better sequel, making it the best 2D Donkey Kong game ever made. Donkey Kong’s once peaceful world has been taken over by snow themed bad guys, and as the title suggests, that means a beautiful mix of palm trees and ice everywhere, leading to some truly genius (and very tough) platforming sequences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you find things a bit too tough, just try out Funky Mode, an optional difficulty decrease that allows players to play as everyone’s favorite monkey that owns an airport. Speaking of which, Tropical Freeze features more playable Kongs than any Donkey Kong game before it including Donkey, Diddy, Dixie, and at long last, Cranky Kong who just couldn’t stay retired. Tropical Freeze is the culmination of all of the best things from the best Donkey Kong Country games mixed up in one perfect frozen cocktail. Once Retro gets Metroid Prime 4 in the rear view it would be amazing to see them return to this series one more time. But luckily for us, there’s another Donkey Kong game to hold us over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/dkpreview-1743659889915.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, the latest Donkey Kong game is his greatest. Developed by the team behind the incredible Super Mario Odyssey, Donkey Kong Bananza gives DK a whole new bag of toys to play with and a whole new world to destroy. De-emphasizing the tight platforming that the Country series was known for, Bananza opts instead to celebrate Donkey Kong’s brute force and heavy fists, allowing him to punch holes in the earth in search of collectibles, rip out huge rocks to ride around and throw, and so much more. It also reunites him with Pauline, this time as friends and collaborators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza is also Donkey Kong’s biggest game yet. It’s absolutely packed with secret areas, unlockable costumes, and optional challenge rooms and it can easily take players dozens of hours to find it all. It’s a loving celebration of this iconic and legendary Nintendo character, hopefully paving the way for more Donkey Kong games like it for years to come. For a character that has been reinvented a ton of times since 1981, it’s amazing to see Donkey Kong return for his first 3D game since 1999 and to do so with a game that feels both totally fresh and quintessentially Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, the ten best Donkey Kong games of all time. Did any of the games on this list kongfuse you? Were there any other DK games we should have kongsidered? Well, go bananas and let me know in the kongments below. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Decades ago, Atari games were some of the first titles to leap from arcades to home consoles. Now, a small selection of Atari's re-imagined classics are heading to AirConsole, an entertainment and gaming platform designed exclusively for cars.</p><p>AirConsole and Atari <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/airconsole-brings-legendary-atari-arcade-games-to-cars-302507956.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that Asteroids Recharged and Breakout Charged are now playable for the in-vehicle entertainment system that is currently available in supported Volkswagen models. To play the games, drivers need an active VW Connect Plus contract and an internet connection on a smartphone. However, the games will only work if the car is parked. Once players scan the accompanying QR codes, their phones become the controllers for the AirConsole titles.</p><p>"The AirConsole team has a phenomenal track record of optimizing the in-car controls and producing amazing playing experiences in vehicles," said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a statement. "We are excited for Volkswagen drivers and their passengers to discover these modern versions of our classic titles."</p><p>Atari will eventually add Missile Command: Recharged to its AirConsole lineup, but no other specific titles were mentioned by name. AirConsole is also working with carmakers Audi and BMW, but the Atari games are currently only available through Volkswagen cars.</p><p>Earlier this year, Atari announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">a new version of the 1984 arcade game I, Robot</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout Beyond</a>, an updated title that was originally intended to be released on Intellivision's Amico, a console that has yet to launch.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot answered several questions during the company's General Meeting 2025 held earlier this month (a recording is available <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, though you'll have to register first to access it).</p>



<p>The executive addressed hot topics related to Ubisoft, such as the commercial failure of Star Wars Outlaws, which he blamed largely on the IP's current woes:</p>



<p><em>For Star Wars Outlaws, we didn't reach our sales targets. The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand - the brand that it belonged to - was in 'choppy waters'. And the game had a few items that still needed to be polished, and they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes. We did heavily improve the game after those early weeks, and when it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, it will have a new version of the game.  </em></p>



<p>Guillemot refers to the fact that some Star Wars products that were released immediately before Star Wars Outlaws did not perform well. Chiefly, he might be referring to The Acolyte, which aired between June and July 2024 and was already canceled in August due to low viewership.</p>



<p>It's hard to imagine The Acolyte having such a big impact on Star Wars Outlaws sales, though. After all, other live action TV series like The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka had much better reception among fans. Much more accurate is the other half of Guillemot's statement, where the Ubisoft CEO admits that the game launched with several problems that were only ironed out over the course of the following months. Perhaps the game, in its current, improved state, will find a new audience on the Nintendo Switch 2, where it is scheduled to launch on September 4.</p>



<p>In the General Meeting 2025, the Ubisoft CEO also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games initiative</a>:</p>



<p><em>Regarding the petition, we operate in a market and whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7. So, we provide information regarding the game and how long the game can be played. Players and buyers are forewarned that the game may be discontinued. </em></p>



<p><em>[...] This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft. All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players, because obviously, support for old games cannot last forever. But that's an issue that we're working on, and it's something that the industry at large is working on to minimize impact on players. But clearly, it's something that you need to factor in. The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there is a service component, eventually the services may be discontinued because the software may become obsolete over time. </em></p>
