The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A former senior writer from Sony Santa Monica has revealed the studio is working on "a new franchise within the God of War universe".</p>
<p>The LinkedIn account that shared the news seems to no longer exist, but a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">screenshot</a> of their profile, if real, suggests the team is developing the franchise beyond the God of War games we currently know.</p>
<p>The senior writer, who worked at the studio from 2020 until late last year, reportedly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">wrote</a> on their <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lsignorino/">LinkedIn</a> profile that they had "helped shape narrative visions and creative direction and Sony Santa Monica Studio for a franchise within the God of War universe, developing characters, storylines, and original lore that expanded the acclaimed IP".</p>
<p>"Integrated story with gameplay and worldbuilding through scripts and narrative content, collaborating across disciplines to deliver emotionally driven experiences for a global audience," the blurb continued. "Contributed to long-term narrative and franchise strategy."</p>
<p>Given the original LinkedIn account has been deleted, there's no way to authenticate the claim, but it does tie in with prior reporting, including news that Bluepoint – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">which was closed last week</a> – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">was developing a live service game within the God of War series</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/page-4#post-151996075">Commenting</a> on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">ResetEra</a> thread that shared the news late yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote: "I suppose now it's become obvious what I meant by 'not a new IP but it might feel like one'".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-shares-look-at-ryan-hurst-as-kratos-in-god-of-war-tv-series">Amazon shared a first look at Ryan Hurst as Kratos in its God of War TV series</a>. The picture showed Hurst leaning forward as he taught his son, Atreus, played by Callum Vinson, how to hunt. It's an image that echoes the opening scenes of the God of War reboot, released in 2018.</p>

It's been a busy one with a Nintendo Direct, a Pokémon Presents, and a couple of shadow drops and Switch 2 surprises. That means it's time for a lovely edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, a big month for what is the shortest one of the year. Spring is approaching, but that doesn't mean we want to start stepping outside and enjoying the crisp, early sunshine. There's a <em>lot</em> of games on the eShop right now, so let's look at the best of them.</p>
<p>So, the rules: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from February 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8xzinut&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable Mentions</h3>
<p>This past month gave us eight games to fight over for the top three positions, all scoring at least a 7/10 from us. A couple of them are getting physical releases later in the year, but as with previous iterations of this regular feature, they're eligible for the votes here.</p>
<p>Obviously Switch 2 Edition shadow drops graced us this month, but given that we haven't officially reviewed them, we've opted to exclude them from the vote this time around — sorry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of other game releases, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> just sneaked in at the end of the month, but we didn't have access to them before release so we're working on our review. And we also want to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which are <em>technically</em> available physically via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-generation-pack">Resident Evil Generation Pack</a> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So, let's give it up for the smaller releases that just missed out on the podium.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">3rd Place - Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>After months of rumours, was anyone surprised to see Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> pop up during Sony's State of Play in February? The most shocking part of the reveal was that it was also out within 24 hours of its announcement.</p>
<p>And yes, the collection does have a handful of issues in the form of music and a lack of variety in content, <em>but</em> as always with Digital Eclipse, the magic of the museum, the documentary-style clips, and the added bonuses make this a worthy celebration for an Ubisoft icon.</p>
<p>We hope those issues are fixed by the time the physical release rolls out, because the original Rayman deserves the best, hence its placement in the top three. For now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">it gets a 7/10 from us</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">2nd Place - The Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Wait, what's this? <em>Another</em> Digital Eclipse job? And this one goes even further back. We've been clamouring for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> on Switch, and we've been rewarded for our patience: with the addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bonkers">Bonkers</a>, we now have eight retro classics to dig into on both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Really, Goof Troop is the star here, but we think most of the games in the compilation are great. If you grew up with any of these NES and SNES titles, then you'll <em>also</em> know that some of these games are darn tough. Thank goodness for rewind and some other QoL features then.</p>
<p>It really is a retro fan's dream, and a good reminder of some excellent classic Disney titles. We awarded the collection <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">an 8/10 in our review</a> for those reasons and more.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">1st Place - Caves of Qud (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>But Rayman and Disney are no match for 17 years of game development and one of the most-ambitious and rich roguelikes <em>ever</em>. After being in Early Access for a long time and releasing on Steam back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> made its console debut on Switch in February 2026 with very little compromised for the hybrid system.</p>
<p>Is it dense? Yes. Is it complex? Very. And is there a little too much squeezed onto the little screen at once? Maybe. But what Caves of Qud delivers is an incredibly rewarding experience for those who love good systems and good stories. It's tense, it's tough, but it's deeply satisfying.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">We gave Caves of Qud an 8/10</a>, and it sits at the top of the podium for February's eShop Selects. Congrats to Freehold Games for this monumental achievement!</p>
</div></div><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026"><strong>&lt; Nintendo eShop Selects - January 2026</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-february-2026]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to dataminer PlayStation Game Size</a> (@PlaystationSize on X), <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> has just added title IDs for <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> on Sony's <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>, possibly hinting at pre-orders opening in the near future:</p>



<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database. I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders.</em></p>



<p>When asked how long it usually takes between the time when title IDs first appear on the store and the actual reveal of the pricing information, the dataminer replied:</p>



<p><em>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it's not something I know for sure. But I don't think there's going to be a long wait.</em></p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size <strong>regularly scrapes the PlayStation Store database</strong> searching for news and details about upcoming games. They'd previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launch-date-possibly-leaked-via-ps-store-db/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered the placeholder date for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong></a>, September 30, 2022, which had been entered into the PlayStation Store, and it turned out to be not far from the actual release date, <strong>November 11, 2022</strong>. More recently, they were behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original discovery of the native Kingdom Come: Deliverance PlayStation 5 version</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The fact that Rockstar Games has started doing preparatory work on Grand Theft Auto VI's store page will undoubtedly reinvigorate the hopes of fans, who are eager to see the studio confirm the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Nov</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">mber 19, 2026 date</a></strong>. There have already been two delays, after all, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a></strong>, and then again to November. <strong>Rockstar has never delayed any of its games three times</strong>, but there's a first time for everything.</p>



<p>As much as people are waiting to see if it actually releases this year, <strong>there's almost the same level of anticipation to discover the game's price</strong>. Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a tremor throughout the industry</a> when he claimed Rockstar (and publisher <strong>Take-Two</strong>) could get away with launching a base game at <strong>$100</strong> for the first time in history. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-should-cost-70-achieve-maximum-sales-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Rockstar developers</a> believe it will still be priced at <strong>$70</strong>, especially because <strong>a lower price opens up the true goldmine - the online mode - to more players</strong>.</p>



<p>There's still a lot we have to learn about Grand Theft Auto VI, though we do know, based on what a veteran developer has heard and revealed to Wccftech, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the online mode could feel a bit like an MMO</a></strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-ugly-sonic-2000674861</link>
            <guid>1449988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon revealed a first look at its <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450"><em>God of War</em> TV show</a> on Friday and it went terribly. People rushed to gawk at the live-action adaptation’s set image <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">featuring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and child actor Callum Vinson</a> as a very young Atreus. The internet immediately spit out its Kombucha juice in collective confusion and bemusement. Hurst has now responded to the backlash on Instagram with a cryptic message that has some fans praying for an “ugly Sonic” turnaround.</p>

 <p>“Don’t believe everything you see on the internet, kids,” the <i>Sons of Anarchy</i> actor wrote on his Instagram stories <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1rgzptt/this_was_posted_on_ryan_hursts_kratos_instagram/">over the weekend</a>. Fans were confused given that the image everyone was reacting to was an official marketing beat from Amazon to promote the upcoming series and not, like, a weird leak from the set or AI deepfake. But some fans are hoping that the image was just terribly assembled and touched up with AI effects and so the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-live-action-image-online-reactions-kratos-atreus-2000674479">Spirit Halloween-looking result</a> isn’t actually representative of the real end product.</p>   <p>Look, out of context TV and movie promotional photos often look like crap. Remember everyone freaking out about Superman lacing his shoes while aliens shot purple lasers in the background in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/06/29/new-superman-set-photos-generate-strong-fan-reactions/">first photo</a> for James Gunn’s reboot? First looks like these also give studios a chance to adapt costumes and makeup in light of fan reactions. Maybe this was just an elaborate trial balloon to figure out the final design?</p> <p>That’s basically what some <em>God of War</em> fans are hoping for as they stick Amazon’s Kratos in the same bucket as “ugly Sonic.” People reacted so poorly to the initial trailer for CGI Sonic in the live-action movies that the filmmakers ended up going back and spending a bunch of money and time fixing every frame of his face. That’s one possible outcome here, though it’s still unclear what deeper truth Hurst is referring to. Is the image above failing to correctly capture how Kratos actually looks in the new TV series, or is he suggesting the show has already changed things up since back when this was taken?</p> <p>I can’t wait to see how this all pans out.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Requiem is likely now the biggest Resident Evil game in the franchise's history, sporting a concurrent player count on Steam high enough to rival even multiplayer games.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, single-player Resident Evil Requiem has an all-time concurrent peak of 344,214 players on Steam alone, over double that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, and three times that of predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a>, on the other hand, has a Steam peak of 74,227 players, Resident Evil 3 a peak of 60,293, and Resident Evil 7, 20,449.</p>
<p>That 344,214 player peak is also bigger than the all-time Steam concurrent records of multiplayer games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> (316,750), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> (313,593), and Monster Hunter: World (334,684).</p>
<p>Of course, concurrent peaks do not reflect players jumping into the action on other platforms – or even via other PC stores like Epic Games Store – so cannot be taken in isolation, but it's typically a good indication of popularity. It also shows that Capcom has sold at least 344,214 copies in Requiem's debut weekend.</p><p>As spoilers popped all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya had some choice words for the leakers, suggesting "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>"Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism, too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care," Matt wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">5/5 Eurogamer Resident Evil Requiem review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-outbound-demo-firewatch-cozy-2000674849</link>
            <guid>1449955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a game I love called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-dark-is-boring-and-thats-why-its-great-1775860048"><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i></a><span>. It’s a relentless survival sim that pits you against the elements out in the wilderness. You can starve, freeze to death, or get mauled by a pack of wild wolves. It has this oppressive, foreboding vibe to it that few games can match. <em>Outbound</em> is kind of the cozy sim version of that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I played the Steam Next Fest demo for </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, a campervan driving survival game from developers Square Glade Games, and it feels like someone ran </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span> through a Pixar filter. These two games share so much in common: light crafting elements, a need to scavenge to fill your stomach, an intentionally light focus on your sense of direction, and that lonely feeling of living within a world that other people have left behind.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674851"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674851">Square Glade Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>is also kind of the very antithesis of </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span>. You get hungry, sure, but you won’t starve to death: you’ll just pass out. The world is devoid of human interaction, but there’s plenty of cute little animals to make friends with instead (and a co-op mode I, ironically, couldn’t convince a friend to try with me). You can’t even run the animals over with your massive, unwieldy campervan. Trust me, I tried. There’s friction but the world isn’t out to make you fail.</span></p> <p><span>Strangely, that’s what I loved about my three hours with </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, whose demo is one of the most popular of February’s Steam Next Fest</span><span>. It’s an easy, breezy experience. It’s a survival game about trying your best to live as opposed to one about desperately trying not to die. There’s really no wrong way to play it, either, because the focus is on, if you’ll excuse the pun, simply enjoying the ride. You’re not even really tasked with accomplishing any specific goals. Sometimes you’ll get a prompt telling you there’s a new schematic you can unlock or a location you’ve yet to visit, but there’s always this “only if you want to” mentality to it all. </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>won’t scream at you for playing it the wrong way, because there’s no right way to begin with.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674853">Square Glade Games©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are plenty of silly systems to interact with, though, if you so choose. You can build a big house, start your own farm, or even amass a friendly army of bunnies by feeding them heaps of berries. All of these mechanics are straightforward to use and, most importantly, extremely forgiving. If all you wanna do is munch on some wild mushrooms and sit by a fire with your dog, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>doesn’t care, man. Put your hulking brute of a motorhome in park and just watch the sunset go down if you want, dude. No wolves are gonna rip you limb from limb once the moon appears, bro. Just pet the cute bunnies and let the chill, outdoor vibes wash over you.</span></p>

 <p><span>I saw a few reviews poke fun at <i>Outbound</i> for being “cozyslop,” and my heart goes out to those poor souls. Do we always need a deep endgame or a grand cause to work toward? Does there have to be a destination? Because if you go into </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>expecting </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> meets </span><i><span>Burnout</span></i><span>, you’re gonna come away disappointed (even though that sounds sick). But if you go in expecting </span><i><span>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance </span></i><span>mixed with </span><i><span>Firewatch</span></i><span>, you’ll get what you came for: a relaxing game about doing nothing in particular. I’m already looking forward to cozy-friend-slopmaxxing my </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>playthrough </span><span>when the full release drops sometime before summer 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <ul><li><strong>New Operators</strong><ul><li><strong>Tangtang</strong> (6-star Caster) – Described as a “one-girl team,” Tangtang is specialized in AOE Cryo damage and support. Her Ultimate, DA CHIEF SEES YOU!, introduces a powerful new tactical layer by immobilizing all enemies within its range – including bosses – allowing her squads to create decisive damage windows.</li><li><strong>Rossi</strong> (6-star Guard) – The only operator currently capable of converting Arts Infliction on enemies into Vulnerability (defense break). This specialized mechanic positions her as a vital force multiplier for Physical-focused squads, as she shreds enemy defenses to facilitate massive damage output from the team’s primary carries.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hydro-Industrialization</strong><ul><li><strong>New Tech</strong> – The Hydro Mining Rig allows players to mine Cuprium, a new industrial resource that uses water flow instead of electricity. Unlike existing facilities, Hydro Mining Rigs harness water flow to automate mineral collection, requiring no connection to the power grid.</li><li><strong>New Logistics</strong> – New Conduits for long-distance liquid transport and Water Treatment Units for processing sewage.<br>Forges of the Sky Expansion: Placement limit for Forges of the Sky increased to four units, significantly raising the production ceiling for endgame resources.</li></ul></li><li><strong>World and Story Expansions</strong><ul><li><strong>New Wuling Area</strong> – Qingbo Stockade</li><li><strong>Story</strong> – The Endministrator can investigate the Qingbo Stockade, where tensions with Wuling City are boiling over due to the arrival of Nefarith and Ardashir.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Player Rewards and Progression</strong></p><p>In addition to the launch window offering of 135 free pulls, player rewards will now be supplemented by:</p><ul><li><strong>New Beginner Support</strong> – After reaching specific milestones in Chapter 1, players will receive a new beginner mission reward totalling 10 Chartered Headhunting Permits. Endministrators who have already completed these requirements can claim their rewards directly from the event page upon the update.</li><li><strong>Sign-In Events</strong> – “Gently Flows Qingbo” and “Pearl of the Pack” (7-day logins) for limited-time permits.<br>Battle Pass Update: The Protocol Pass now allows for periodic acquisition of Basic Headhunting Permits.</li><li><strong>Limited-time Activities</strong><ul><li><strong>Exploration Day</strong> – Farming at Originium Science Park.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Survival [513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Training</strong> – Try a different take on combat using only Industrial Explosives!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Systemic Rewards</strong> – AIC Quota acquisition has been expanded, with players now receiving Quotas for obtaining 4, 5, and 6-star operators for the first time. For operators acquired prior to the update, the corresponding Quotas will be distributed via in-game mail.</li><li><strong>Advanced Gear Optimization</strong> – The introduction of the Valley Multi-Line Engraving Kit – available through the Stock Redistribution system—allows players to create Essences with three customized stats. This provides a high-level path for Endministrators to optimize endgame weapon builds and reduce RNG friction.</li></ul><p><strong>Community-Driven Optimizations</strong></p><p>Following launch feedback, Version 1.1 introduces sweeping improvements to the user experience, particularly for controller players.</p><ul><li><strong>Construction Precision</strong> – The buffer range for power lines has been extended to 20m (100m total), and connection will no longer snap during dialogue or combat triggers. Controller users can also now move facilities by long-pressing a dedicated button.</li><li><strong>Exploration HUD</strong> – A new feature allows the minimap and game map to be accessed while using ziplines, improving navigation across the vertical terrain of Qingbo Stockade.</li><li><strong>Combat Ready</strong> – Operators now enter Protocol Spaces with maximum HP and Ultimate Energy.

            <p>Bungie is continuing to respond to your feedback during Marathon's Server Slam event, paying particular attention to your thoughts on the UI, PC performance, and those pesky weasel error codes.</p>
<p>The Server Slam – scheduled to close tomorrow, Monday 2nd March, 6pm UK time – is not only giving players the chance to try before they buy, but it's also helping Bungie stamp out bugs and server issues ahead of its full launch next week on 5th March.</p>
<p>"As we continue through your third full day on Tau Ceti, we wanted to once again share some of the primary discussion topics we've seen pop up - and, share some ways you can provide us intel if you haven't had a chance to just yet," the team explained, before thanking players "for taking the time" to share their feedback and "ensure that the launch goes as smoothly as possible".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Here's the full update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI feedback:</strong> We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778">https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778</a></li>
<li><strong>PC performance:</strong> We are reviewing reports of high CPU use, low GPU utilisation, FPS ceilings ~80–100, and some stuttering. If you’re running into any of these issues (or another one we didn’t mention), please feel free to mosey on over to our Help Forum and let us know! Details on your system specs or links to short video clips are super helpful:<a href="http://bung.ie/marathonsupport"> http://bung.ie/marathonsupport</a></li>
<li><strong>PvP frequency:</strong> As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you've got any feedback - be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh - we want to hear it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement and heat generation:</strong> As the test continues on, we’ve seen continued discussions about heat generation, momentum, and overall movement feedback. Make sure to take a chance and let us know your thoughts!</li>
<li><strong>Med and ammo economy: </strong>These two items have been a regular feedback item, and we’re thankful to see your reports. Discussions about stack sizes, the efficacy of green-tier med items, and more opportunities for ammo to drop have been primary topics – but, our ears remain open. Keep sharing your experiences and please let us know what you brought into any runs where you feel like you’re running dry.</li>
<li><strong>Weasel error codes:</strong> Over the last day we’ve seen a number of Weasel error codes, which are caused by a disruption of your network connection to Marathon servers. We have several investigations under way and will report back with updates. In some cases, this may be caused by issues with your home Internet connection, or with your Internet provider. If you have made changes that have resolved this issue for you, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off just before the weekend, and attracted a healthy number of players on Steam. The game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>, with a Steam peak of around 76K players on Saturday (28th February).</p>

<figure data-uuid="651d040c05574"><a title="30 Pokémon You Probably Forgot That Deserve A Second Chance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/651d040c05574/30-pokemon-you-probably-forgot-that-deserve-a-second-chance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given Pokémon’s roaring popularity for three decades straight, it’s a sheer numbers game to figure that each of its titular beasts is someone’s favourite. It’s also true that over 1,000 Pokémon can’t all share the limelight, meaning some are bound to fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>While the most popular Pokémon take centre stage for the franchise’s 30th anniversary, I figured space should be made to honour the PokéMisfits that didn’t stand the test of time. These include oddities that only the staunchest Poké Maniacs will recall, others of minor notoriety that deserve more love, and phased-out mascots. While they may be easily written off as sideshows, these Pokémon still played roles (in some cases, infamously) in keeping the franchise on top for all these years.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvywpsg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>Before jumping in, a quick note: I left out Gen 9 'newcomers' as their legacies are still being written. I also had regional variants, mega evolutions, and their ilk take a seat to keep the proceedings simpler.</p>
<h2>30 PokéMisfits That Deserve More Love</h2>
<p>First up, <strong><u>PokéWho?</u></strong></p>
<p>This category covers Pokémon that many straight-up forgot about. They’re sure to have their fans — that’s true of any Pokémon — but by and large, they never caught on, or only enjoyed fleeting relevancy...</p>
<div><div><h3>Shedinja (#292)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="aa775a7f274ee"><a title="Shedinja #292" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aa775a7f274ee/shedinja-292.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one element of the Pokémon fandom that I’ll forever miss, it’s the schoolyard tall tales that kids told each other when we didn’t have easy internet access. By Gen 3, scepticism had set in, making me disbelieve Shedinja’s existence.</p>
<p>I have to keep a spot in my party empty and have a spare Poké Ball to obtain it? Sounded about as likely as finding Mew under a truck!</p>
<p>Of course, it does work… and that’s about the most I can say. Schoolyard chatter quickly moved on to new leaks and lies. Shedinja’s allure became its undoing as myths were far more compelling than truths. It’s now notable as a historical footnote and its unique Bug/Ghost dual-typing. That’s more than can be said for a lot of the entries in this category, but nonetheless disappointing for such a conceptually cool Pokémon.</p>
</div><div><h3>Klinklang #601</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7e781a410d085"><a title="Klinklang #601" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e781a410d085/klinklang-601.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not a lot working in Klinklang’s favour. Its design is simultaneously basic, even among Gen 5’s wave of inanimate object Pokémon, and also derivative of Magneton. It’s therefore not too surprising that this gearhead wouldn’t leave much of an impact.</p>
<p>However, I do believe it has the potential to earn a renewed residency in the minds of fans by having it utilise its utilitarian design to help keep the Pokémon world running. For example, imagine a city running on Klinglang-powered machinery, or gadgets that could be brought alive by a Klinglang in your party.</p>
<p>That sort of worldbuilding is what Klinglang is destined for.</p>
</div><div><h3>Zarude #893</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7c7b46306725f"><a title="Zarude #893" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c7b46306725f/zarude-893.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This mythical primate was never made available beyond a few online distribution events that occurred a year or more after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword and Shield</a> (let alone after both its expansion packs were available). It’s highly possible that most Sword and Shield players never even learned of Zarude’s existence because of its late addition. Many who did still had a hard time finding love in their heart for this monkey due to a lack of an in-game event to give it the context it desperately needed.</p>
<p>Zarude could see a renaissance if The Pokémon Company decides to reintroduce it with expanded prominence, but for now, it’s a bit of a non-entity.</p>
</div><div><h3>Dhelmise #781</h3>
<figure data-uuid="d90bb525b981a"><a title="Dhelmise #781" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90bb525b981a/dhelmise-781.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept behind Dhelmise is cool enough: a rusty, seaweed-strapped anchor that can supposedly knock out Wailord in one attack (Pokémon battles don’t back up this claim). The reality is that it’s ultimately just a possessed anchor, something that wasn’t particularly novel by the time of its Gen 7 introduction.</p>
<p>It’s well themed for the tropical Alolan archipelago, but then again, so are many of that region’s newcomers. Still, I give props to Game Freak for giving wacky ideas like this a shot, even if they don’t always catch on. For better or worse, they can’t all be Garbodor.</p>
</div><div><h3>Maractus #556</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f14d447f69b5b"><a title="Maractus #556" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14d447f69b5b/maractus-556.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the second Cactus Pokémon to lay its roots in the franchise, Maractus needed a bit more going for it to stand out. Namely, it’s a type of single-evolution Pokémon that feels like it shouldn’t be standalone. The design concept of maracas growing out of its head is the perfect setup for an evolution to run with.</p>
<p>Without one, it felt like borderline Gen. 5 filler added so that generation wouldn't include any old monsters until its post-game. I hoped that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Legends Z-A</a> might’ve given it a plus-up in the form of a mega evolution, but with that opportunity gone, who knows if Maractus will ever get the treatment it deserves.</p>
</div><div><h3>Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368</h3>
<figure data-uuid="50e749ef52d2c"><a title="Huntail #367 and Gorebyss #368" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/50e749ef52d2c/huntail-367-and-gorebyss-368.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>These two share an evolutionary base Pokémon in the adorable Clamperl, yet neither share in its fandom. In fact, it wasn’t until researching for this article that I remembered Clamperl even had evolutions at all!</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s because both require trading, which has always been a somewhat frustrating (even if understandably flavourful) barrier to using certain Pokémon, especially if you’re a solo player like me. I have to imagine that’s also true for many others whose only encounters with Huntail and Gorebyss came through trainer battles or rare in-the-wild scenarios.</p>
<p>It’s a shame because these groovy, psychedelic eels have been waiting over two decades for their moment in the sun. Or perhaps they just prefer the deep ocean, in which case, live your best lives, sea misfits.</p>
</div><div><h3>Stakataka #805</h3>
<figure data-uuid="c328a1aae3281"><a title="Stakataka #805" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c328a1aae3281/stakataka-805.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The alien nature of Ultra Beasts makes them all inherent misfits of the Pokémon universe, but that’s also why some have been fondly remembered. Stakataka isn’t usually part of those conversations, though. Its stone colossus design isn’t particularly original or memorable, especially when you consider that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> introduced the strikingly similar Guardians months prior.</p>
<p>Plus, appearing exclusively in 3DS games that launched after the Switch rocked the world was a surefire way to not rock the world. Still, if Ultra Beasts ever come back, Stakataka might find its footing.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Gen. 8 Fossil Quartet (Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883)</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0c4381891ac92"><a title="Dracozolt #880, Arctozolt #881, Dracovish #882, and Arctovish #883" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c4381891ac92/dracozolt-880-arctozolt-881-dracovish-882-and-arctovish-883.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Uhhhhhhh, so yeah.</p>
<p>First, for those keeping count at home, this is one of two scenarios where I’m lumping all four of these… Pokémon?... into one listing since they’re all cut from the same cloth of combining two fossils to create genetic monstrosities.</p>
<p>The Frankenstein creations that this resulted in might be more believable as something found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill</a>. In fact, their mere existence is that level of unsettling, which I suppose will be the feature for many players. For others, we’d rather forget.</p>
<p>That said, I’m open-minded. Game Freak, game on. The ball’s in your court to make me love these patchwork Pokémon.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next up, <strong><u>The Under-Appreciated Misfits.</u></strong></p>
<p>The Pokémon in this category have a steady presence in the franchise but don’t get the love they deserve. Whether they live in infamy or are overshadowed by their immediate peers, let’s give these beasties a second look on the second page...</p>

            <p>Patricia Summersett, the voice of Princess Zelda in four Legend of Zelda games – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and Hyrule Warriors spin-offs Age of Calamity and Age of Imprisonment – can "write in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> Hylian".</p>
<p>Casually dropping the information into conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship">IGN</a>, Summersett said she taught herself how to write using the Hylian alphabet "over coffee" while recording Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>"It's something I did early on when I was recording [Breath of the Wild] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] Hyrule Historia at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games," she said.</p><p>"Obviously, Breath of the Wild wasn't out yet, so I didn't know what would be in that game. But I saw Twilight Princess Hylian, and it's so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practising that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time."</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Summersett revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/link-and-zelda-are-in-a-relationship-voice-actress-says">she'd interpreted Link and Zelda's friendship as "being in a relationship"</a>, before clarifying she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-voice-actress-backtracks-after-stating-link-and-zelda-were-in-a-relationship">did not mean to imply</a> they were a romantic couple. A few months after that, Nintendo said it was "up to the player's imagination" to interpret the relationship.</p>
<p>Asked to comment once again on the issue, Summersett was cautious, saying: "I have to be so careful when I answer that question. Let me formulate this... I have all sorts of personal theories about what this might be, but I think there's something beautiful in the way that it's left ambiguous, it's left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it's left in an unrequited state. </p>
<p>"There's obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It's a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this."</p>
<p>As for the live-action movie? Summersett said she thinks we're "going to see a strong Zelda. I'm sure you're going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven't alluded to the fact that he does, yet".</p><p>Filming for that aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began last November in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>, respectively, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-action-adaptation-of-the-legend-of-zelda-will-stream-on-netflix">is coming to Netflix after its "theatrical and home entertainment release periods"</a>.</p>

              <p><span>What’s that riff about more time elapsing between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and now than the time between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and the actual 1970s? ‘90s PlayStation freaks, we stand on razor-thin wire. It has been 27 years since </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X </span></i><span>released on the first PlayStation, and 27 years between </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> and the broadcast debut of </span><i><span>Mazinger Z</span></i><span>. Don’t know what </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i></a><span> is? Well, thanks to a new remaster, you can quickly familiarize yourself with the giant mecha spoof, which is now as retro as the cartoons it’s making fun of.</span></p>

 <p><span>Released in 1999, </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is a sideways shoot-em-up about blasting mechanical space fiends. A competent enough shmup, what established </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span> as a cult classic in Japan was its lovingly crafted send-ups of ‘70s anime, such as </span><i><span>Getter Robo</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Mazinger-Z</span></i><span>. An ever escalating robo-opera divided between episodes, with mean robot bosses, increasingly absurd transformations, and suffocatingly tight disco speedsuits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201"><span>And unlike other recent cult-classic Steam ports</span></a><span>, this one’s unwieldy long title is in fact the original.</span></p>  <p><span>The four-disc (count ’em, four) release also held a Saturday morning’s worth of cartoons. Not only the FMV theatrics of the brave </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span>, but mock commercials for toys, shampoo, and parodies of other vintage anime.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is getting </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><span>an official remastered Steam release</span></a><span>, its first time leaving Japan. In addition to new localized language offerings, this remaster also restores the full-motion cutscenes, having digitized the original master tapes. Even across four PS1 discs there ain’t enough leg room for robots that big without some serious 320×240 compression.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> comes to Steam this July for all the ‘90s kids whose media diets were primarily send-ups of late ‘60s variety shows they may never see themselves.</span></p>

		<p>Videogamer, a once respected gaming site, is now seemingly only posting content created by AI.&nbsp; Investigations by various outlets, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-metacritic-ai-review-videogamer-2000674042">Kotaku</a>, have revealed that the new “staff” have AI photos, have brand new social media accounts, and, despite their bios suggesting they have been writing about video games and tech for years, no one has ever heard of them.</p>
<p>This came to the fore when a review for Resident Evil Requiem was posted, which was clearly written by AI, and this was included on Metacritic.</p>


<p>“Metacritic has been a reputable review source for a quarter century and has maintained a rigorous vetting process when adding new publications to our slate of critics,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told&nbsp;Kotaku. “However, in certain instances such as a publication being sold or a writing staff having turned over, problems can arise such as plagiarism, theft, or other forms of fraud including AI-generated reviews.”</p>
<p>“Metacritic’s policy is to never include an AI-generated critic review on Metacritic and if we discover that one has been posted, we’ll remove it immediately and sever ties with that publication indefinitely pending a thorough investigation.”</p>
<p>A number of other reviews from Videogamer, including a Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen , have also been removed.</p>

<p>Videogamer was sold to a company called BGFG, which pushes online casinos and gambling. Google the name Videogamer now and the site states it is a “source for video and casino game news.”</p>

            <guid>1449880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Resident Evil</em> turns 30 this year. The series is full of history — the new <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is technically the ninth mainline game, but there are a bunch of spinoffs, remakes, movies, and even a TV show — which can make it fun to follow for fans. But it’s also intimidating for people like me who haven’t played everything. The latest release, <em>Resident Evil Requiem,</em> tries to appeal to both sides by starring a new character, the cowering FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, and a series favorite, action hero Leon Kennedy.</p><p>Initially, it really works: the first half of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is one of the freshest horror games I’ve ever played. But as the game goes on, it gets bogged down by <em>Resident Evil</em>’s past.</p><p><strong><em>**Spoilers for </em></strong><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong><strong><em> are below.**</em></strong></p><p>For much of the first half of <em>Requiem</em>, the balance between the two is close to perfect. Most of the time, you’re playing as Grace, and her limited arsenal means you have to be thoughtful about every step and bullet. I was constantly on edge as I crept through the hallways of a medical care facility, narrowly creeping past horrors like a monster known only as “the girl” and a huge zombie wielding a butcher knife. And despite some connections to past games, Grace’s story stands on its own, meaning I wasn’t worried about lore I had missed while I was also trying to survive.</p><p>When the game would switch to brief sections in Leon’s perspective, I could take out enemies that I felt powerless against as Grace with relative ease. Leon is more capable in battle than the inexperienced Grace — he’s been through the <em>Resident Evil</em> wringer a few times already — and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was able to kill that butcher knife zombie in a few blasts from my shotgun. But soon enough, I’d be back in Grace’s shoes, experiencing pure terror again and counting the seconds until the game would let me play as Leon for a break from the tension.</p><p>The game goes back and forth like this until, after an extremely satisfying confrontation with the girl, Grace just leaves with a mysterious new villain character who basically comes out of nowhere, and you’re forced to play as Leon as he tries to track down Grace in Raccoon City. Longtime fans will recognize Raccoon City as one of the main settings in the series; Leon stars as a rookie cop for the city in <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, and it was eventually destroyed by a nuclear bomb to contain a zombie virus.</p><p>In <em>Requiem</em>, you spend an extensive amount of time exploring the drab wasteland that Raccoon City has become, including the ruins of the police station where Leon got his start. But without the push-pull of switching between Grace and Leon, the game starts to drag like an overly long action movie. There were also some nods to previous games, like Leon commenting on a puzzle he once solved, and while they might work for those who know the <em>Resident Evil</em> series inside and out, they were less effective on me. Besides <em>Requiem</em>, I’ve played <em>7</em>, <em>Village</em>, and both the original <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and its remake, so none of this nostalgia hit. It just felt like more stuff to get through on my way to finding Grace again for some actual horror.</p><p><em>Requiem’s</em> last main area, a high-tech lab, was a bit more interesting to explore, especially when the game switches between Grace and Leon again. But for a game that sets up Grace as the primary protagonist, I found it disappointing that Leon basically takes over as the main lead, even being the one to fight the final boss. (Which, itself, is a disappointment: a giant plant-like zombie thing with obvious red boils to mindlessly shoot.)</p><p>It was all a letdown of a back half to what was shaping up to be one of my favorite horror games. Maybe I’d feel differently about <em>Requiem</em> if I had played <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. But because of <em>Requiem</em>’s reliance on Leon nostalgia, the game’s dual-character perspective, which started out as its biggest strength, became a weakness by the end.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/885811/resident-evil-requiem-grace-leon-nostalgia-ending]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-ending-explained</link>
            <guid>1449877</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Right at the end of Resident Evil Requiem, you’re presented with a choice to seal the fates of Grace and Leon. There are two options, and we trust that you chose wisely, because the outcome of one is certainly much less desirable than the other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d like to know about the ending you didn’t choose, you’re in the right place. In the video above, you can see both endings play out, and in the text below you can read how it all goes down. So let’s dive in and explain both of Requiem's conclusions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Good Ending</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace and Leon’s adventure brings them to Raccoon City, the place where all this Resident Evil mess began. While we all know that the NEST secret facility was hiding under the city, Requiem reveals that another lab lies beneath the infamous orphanage: the ARK. There, in the system’s computer files, Grace discovers an unpublished interview with Ozwell E. Spencer – Umbrella’s mastermind – conducted by her mom, journalist Alyssa Ashcroft. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video reveals that Spencer was eventually remorseful for all the disasters he caused with Umbrella’s viral and bioweapon projects. His push to be a more decent human is shown by his adoption of a baby girl, Grace. Yes, Grace is just a regular girl, and not some genetic key to a virus as villains Zeno and Victor Gideon have suggested throughout the game. And if you pay close attention to Spencer’s wise words, you can read between the lines to work out that Elpis – the mysterious macguffin at the heart of Requiem – is not in fact a weapon, but the vaccine for bioweapons. And so when Grace is given the opportunity to release or destroy Elpis, it’s clear which is the right way to go.  </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/zeno-1772201414360.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When Grace releases the antiviral, it initially seems like a great result for Zeno – a lightning-fast, sunglasses-wearing, slick haired villain who isn’t actually Wesker, despite all appearances. He believes Elpis is the key to ultimate control, and so swiftly injects it. Unlucky for him, the fast-acting serum quickly cures his existing infections, erasing his Wesker mojo and robbing him of the ability to dodge bullets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make things worse for Zeno, an armless Victor Gideon – Requiem’s lead villain and a former member of Umbrella – arrives on the scene and claims that Spencer’s plan for Elpis was genius, as a world without virus-based weapons would surely descend into anarchy. Unsurprisingly, he’s very onboard with the idea of uncontained chaos. Zeno, who reveals his true masters to be The Connections (the secret evil corporation from Resident Evil 7 and Village), is angered by all this, but his rage is temporary: he’s quickly decapitated by a rapidly mutating Gideon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a boss fight clearly on the way, Grace gets to work on healing Leon – who throughout the game has been suffering from stage three T-Virus infection – with the Elpis antiviral so our hero can take on Victor. Leon makes swift work of Gideon, despite him now having the ability to wield electricity and tear apart flesh with his newly-mutated arm, although in predictable Resident Evil fashion, killing a final boss once just isn’t enough. Gideon mutates into a hulking monstrosity, finally pulling back the curtain on what exactly our not-quite-human villain is: a Nemesis. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/gideon-nemesis-1772201529525.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After shooting a fair amount of pulsating biosack weak points and parrying strikes from tentacles, Gideon is finally defeated. And if that wasn’t Resident Evil enough for you, the entire ARK begins to collapse. With no way of escape, Leon and Grace conclude that they’re goners. But, just in the nick of time, Hound Wolf squad rappel in to save the day. Unfortunately, though, their captain – Resident Evil’s other big hero, Chris Redifeld, is nowhere to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With our protagonists finally safe, Leon informs his handler, Sherry Birkin, that the Elpis antiviral works, and that he has a dose with her name on it (it seems like everyone who was there for the Raccoon City incident is suffering from T-Virus infection). Grace, although free of all the chaos, can’t help but mourn the death of Emily, the young test subject she helped save from Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center before watching her mutate into a bioweapon monstrosity and then get gunned down by Leon. Thankfully, our crack-shot hero theorises she could still be alive because he “didn’t hit any of her vitals”. What a guy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">News reports confirm that every shady Umbrella secret is finally being exposed, including the true motivations behind the missile strike that obliterated Raccoon City in 1998. The Connections are also put on blast by conspiracy theorists, who claim the group is secretly controlling the government and are responsible for Alyssa’s death in an effort to cover up their wrongdoings.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Does Resident Evil Requiem Have a Post-Credits Scene?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/soldiers-1772201748202.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you opt to follow the “good” ending, there is a post credits scene. Set a little while after the events of the game, Grace is back working at her desk as an FBI analyst. A phone call between her and Leon revealed that Emily did survive and now lives with Grace, who is teaching her to read. A photo on Grace’s desk reveals that Emily regained her eyesight, presumably thanks to the restorative qualities of Elpis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and if you take a close look at Grace’s phone, you can see Leon’s phone number displayed. It’s 266-555-0173, if you wanna give that a go. Hopefully Capcom didn’t dox our floppy-haired hero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace’s boss arrives at her desk to demand her full report on the events that occurred in the ARK and their wider implications. The complete 60-page document is then made available to read in the bonus menu, confirming that this ending truly is Requiem’s canon conclusion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the final post-credit scene, back at ARK, shady soldiers wearing all black and gas masks declare that remaining BSAA forces have been neutralized, and they’re on their way to retrieve the “objective” before Wolf Squad arrives. This no doubt teases what The Connections have up their sleeves for the events of Resident Evil 10. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bad Ending</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Should you make the mistake of not realising that Elpis is a cure, and decide to opt for the more traditional route of “destroy the thing that Umbrella made,” you’ll trigger Requiem’s bad ending. After typing in the destruction password, ARK begins to collapse, and Leon, being the hero that he is, springs into action, boosting Grace up to a higher platform so she can escape. Zeno, still loaded with Wesker powers, immediately kicks Leon’s arse, and then unceremoniously holds his gun’s barrel to Leon’s head and pulls the trigger. RIP.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/leon-dead-1772201775195.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Showing no urgency after Leon’s death, Zeno takes one last look at Grace as the platform collapses beneath him and plummets downwards, signalling his apparent end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace, in shock and with no doubt a bit of survivor’s guilt, rides an elevator up to the surface, where she’s greeted by a rescue team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s it! There’s no fancy credits like in the good ending, and no post-credit scenes. The game just finishes. It truly is an anticlimactic bummer. Unsurprisingly, you’re immediately given the option to reload from the moment Grace chooses what to do with Elpis, allowing you to quickly get on with the canon ending. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grace’s Report</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/grace-report-1-1772201843657.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, completing the “good” ending unlocks Grace’s final report in Requiem’s bonus menu. This 60-page document details her findings and six decades of Umbrella activity, stretching back to the company’s establishment in 1968. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two of the company’s co-founders, Ozwell E. Spencer and James Marcus, were ideologically opposed, which caused a number of issues in the direction of Umbrella’s research. While Spencer eventually demoted Marcus, things were already too far gone. The Connections, the shadowy group who Zeno works for, had been funneling funds to Marcus for years, while also placing moles within the company. By the 1990s, Spencer had lost much of his control of Umbrella, and had retreated to ARK to develop Elpis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elpis was created in secret, and so The Connections were only able to learn minor details through their network of moles. The only significant leak suggested Elpis had the potential to upset the military balance of the entire world, an idea The Connections interpreted to mean some kind of mind control virus. This was, of course, totally incorrect – Spencer’s creation was an antiviral that would render the world’s bioweapons impotent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an effort to secure Elpis, The Connections lobbied the US government to launch a missile at Raccoon City in the wake of the original T-Virus outbreak – not to prevent the virus’ spread, but to disrupt the relationship between Umbrella and the U.S. government. By influencing the subsequent criminal trial against Spencer, The Connections ensured he took all the blame for the outbreak, which in turn led to the dissolving of Umbrella. The Connections could then step in and claim the company’s assets, putting them in control of Elpis. All they then had to do was unlock its safeguard system – a task that led them to Grace, Spencer’s adoptive daughter and, as far as they were concerned, the key to releasing the greatest bioweapon of all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace theorises that Spencer’s motivations for Elpis were peace and redemption for the many horrors he was responsible for. Not that such a goal could stop The Connections, seemingly the real power behind the world’s problems, from turning the ruins of Raccoon City into a hub for the production and distribution of bioweapons. She concludes that it’s the FBI’s role to investigate The Connections, who largely remain a mystery, and bring justice to those who have died because of their actions – something that will presumably take us into the story of Resident Evil 10. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-ending-explained]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Arcade Archives 2 Rave Racer (Switch 2) - The Pure Spirit Of Ridge Racer, Finally On Home Console]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer</link>
            <guid>1449868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There's part of me that still can't quite believe I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> on a home console. Namco's 1995 sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> never made it out of the arcades back in the day, despite promises that it would be ported to PC as part of NEC's push for its PowerVR graphics processor.</p>
<p>For years, the game's legacy has been having its circuits reproduced in later Ridge Racer games, but Rave Racer has finally been released from its arcade prison – and while its coin-op roots are both a plus and a minus, what we have here is perhaps the purist example of what makes this franchise so special.</p>
<p>Rave Racer consists of four circuits, two of which are taken from the original Ridge Racer (technically, they're variations on the same track, so in reality, there are, in fact, three courses on offer here). The City and Mountain courses would resurface in the PSP entries <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer">Ridge Racer</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/ridge_racer_2">Ridge Racer 2</a></strong> as 'Midtown Expressway' and 'Greenpeak Highlands', while the City circuit would form the basis of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/ridge_racer_6">Ridge Racer 6's</a> Rave City.</p>
<p>You can choose to either race against 11 other cars or take part in Time Trial events, and it's even possible to race all of the circuits in reverse, thanks to a combination of button presses before selecting your track (right, right, then press the accelerator and brake simultaneously).</p>
<p>Manual and Automatic transmission options are available, and this release lets you compete against three other friends in split-screen mode that replicates the multi-cabinet link-up mode originally seen in arcades. There's also a two-player split-screen mode, too.</p>

<p>These features — alongside the traditional Time Attack, Caravan, and Hi Score modes the Arcade Archives series is famous for — do much to extend the longevity of Rave Racer, which, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Arcade Archives Ridge Racer</a> before it, can quickly become stale if you're not totally committed to perfecting your racing lines and tirelessly improving your track times. After all, this is a game that was designed for arcade and not home play.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progression and low number of circuits on offer, Rave Racer plays like an absolute dream. The handling model in this game is subtly different from that seen in Ridge Racer (and pretty much every other game in the lineage, for that matter); cars aggressively shift as they make sharp turns, and the camera itself tilts whenever you drift around a tight corner. Furthermore, there's an on-screen splitstream gauge that shows when you're benefiting from 'drafting' behind rival cars.</p>
<p>The drifting itself feels like it offers more bandwidth for player skill to emerge; it takes a little getting used to initially (especially for those of us weaned on the PS1 port of Ridge Racer, which was designed with digital and not analogue steering in mind), but after a few hours of play you fall into an almost subconcious 'flow state' and the whole experience becomes practically otherworldly.</p>
<p>Rave Racer isn't the perfect racing game, by any means; there's not a lot of content and no career mode, but the on-track action is as pure and exhilarating as any you'll encounter in the arcade racing sub-genre. And, in case you were wondering, yes, the game still has the bug which has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1RW0MTujA">allowed players to totally smash the game's course records.</a></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-open-world/</link>
            <guid>1449862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With many franchises going open-world when they weren’t before, leaks and rumors indicated that Resident Evil Requiem would follow the herd and make Grace and Leon’s adventure an open-world affair.</p>



<p>Not a single <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game has ever gone fully open-world. The series has largely stuck to a rigid linearity and occasionally dabbled in semi-open worlds with deeper, interconnected areas to form a larger map.</p>



<p>It was thought that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem </a>might be the one to break the chain.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-an-open-world-game">Is Resident Evil Requiem An Open-World Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is most definitely not an open-world game, as Leon and Grace’s respective gameplay sections are chopped-up chunks, with different areas being separated by loading screens, scripted events, and more.</strong></p>



<p>If you love the trademark Resi formula for level design, you won’t be disappointed with Requiem.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s a Spencer Mansion-like hub area where you’ll spend a few hours or more solving puzzles, finding items, and locating keys for locked doors and rooms. There are linear action sequences, even more condensed locales with new puzzles and mechanics, and that’s how it goes for the duration of Resident Evil Requiem.</p>



<p>It’s anything but a seamless open-world design.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-explained">Resident Evil 9 Open World Rumors, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Leaks and rumors in the build-up to Resident Evil Requiem’s launch suggested the game would be open-world, and Resident Evil 9’s director later confirmed this to be true. While he clarified that the proposed rumors were worked on, he made it clear that the plans didn’t get very far.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming covered the news a while back that the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-online-open-world-rumors-were-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem online open-world rumors were true</a>.’</p>



<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed Capcom had tinkered with open-world and online multiplayer elements, featuring multiple players taking on Raid-esque Zombies.</p>

</ul>



<p>However, the team quickly distanced Requiem from these ideas for one simple reason: It’s not something “fans wanted to see or play.”</p>



<p>The wait goes on for an open-world Resident Evil game, and to be honest, it’s not something the franchise is crying out for. That’s IG’s opinion, so let us know if you disagree and you want to see what an open-world Resi title looks like.

<p>The Roulette table located in the Parlor in Resident Evil Requiem seems to be nothing more than just a novelty distraction you can interact with, but it’s actually a little Easter Egg with a fun reward. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> loves filling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games with secrets. So no one should be surprised that while you’re trying to deal with a homicidal Chef zombie and a creature the size of an entire room, the developer wants you to uncover the mystery of the Roulette table!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-win-at-roulette-in-resident-evil-9">How To Win At Roulette In Resident Evil 9</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spin the wheel. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to shoot either 7, 15, or 29 on the Roulette table with your gun, then spin the Roulette wheel; if your number comes up, you officially beat the Easter Egg.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/organless-corpse-walkthrough-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Organless Corpse Walkthrough In Resident Evil Requiem</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Before a full explanation, here’s the method:</p>



<ol>
<li>First, <strong>ensure that you save</strong> (or the game has auto-saved) before attempting this, so you don’t waste ammo.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Parlor </strong>in the Care Center’s West Wing.</li>



<li>Approach the Roulette table.</li>



<li>Using any weapon (ideally a Pistol), shoot either <strong>Red 7, Black 15, or Black 29</strong> once, on the main part of the Roulette table—not on the wheel!</li>



<li>An audio cue should occur to indicate you’ve done this correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Do not shoot any other numbers once you’ve shot one of the outlined numbers</strong>.</li>



<li>Spin the Roulette wheel.</li>



<li>If it lands on the number you shot, you win.</li>



<li>If the wrong number comes up, you need to repeat steps 4-7 until your number comes up.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most important instruction is to save before attempting this. You have a 1 in 3 chance of your number coming up, but basic maths suggests you could be <em>very </em>unlucky and burn through vital bullets. If you waste so much as one bullet, feel free to reload your most recent save and head back to the Parlor.</p>



<p>7, 15, and 29 are the only numbers that can come up. In our experience, 15 seemed to come up the most, but again, it’s probably through coincidence more than an objective value swaying the odds.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-you-get-for-beating-roulette-easter-egg-puzzle-in-resident-evil-requiem">What Do You Get For Beating Roulette Easter Egg Puzzle In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p><strong>If you shoot one of the three numbers on the table and it comes up on the wheel, you will be rewarded with an Antique Coin in Resident Evil 9.</strong></p>



<p>The Care Center’s Parlor has four items for you to exchange Antique Coins for: Two steroid injections, an inventory upgrade, and an upgrade for the Blood Collector.</p>

</ul>



<p>But you need more coins for later on, so it’s imperative you collect all Antique Coins—so win at Roulette before you advance in the story.</p>



<p>How lucky (or unlucky) were you with Roulette? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="43d9786118aff"><a title="Pokémon 30th Anniversary Box Art Brawl" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43d9786118aff/pokemon-30th-anniversary-box-art-brawl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>'!' Whoops! Looks like you've walked into our path. The exclamation mark has already appeared above our heads. We challenge you to a very special edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we send out this week's competitors, however, let's recap what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">last time</a>. Marking another significant Nintendo anniversary as Zelda turned 40, we matched up two covers for the OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, and after a weekend of voting, the decision was split! Like, 50/50 split. Congrats to both parties, we guess!</p>
<p>But anywho, back to this week's battle. To celebrate 30 wonderful years of Pokémon, we're matching up the generations this time to find out which is the very best (like no one ever was). While we've included the enhanced 'third' editions for each gen where applicable, we've stuck to just the Western mainline games and removed any remakes or Legends inclusions to keep things fair — naturally, some Gens will have more covers than others, but do they add up to a better picture overall?</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvywpsg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There are the full <em>nine</em> options to choose from this time, so make sure you're stocked up on Potions, and let's get into it.</p>
<h2>Gen I - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red, Blue</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_yellow_version_special_pikachu_edition">Yellow</a></h2>

<p>It doesn't get much more iconic than this, eh? While legendaries would go on to take centre stage on the series' box art, Gen I kicked things off with two of its fully-evolved Starters (Venusaur occupies the 'Green' variant in Japan) and the most well-known 'mon of all, Pikachu.</p>
<p>The backgrounds are as simple as they come, but we love the hand-drawn look of the central figures.</p>
<h2>Gen II - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold, Silver</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_crystal">Crystal</a></h2>

<p>The Gen II legendaries are truly some of the best out there. Lugia, Ho-Oh and Suicune adorn this generation's box art, with shiny backgrounds that really sell a 'step-up' for the series. Talk about a touch of class!</p>
<h2>Gen III - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby, Sapphire</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a></h2>

<p>By Gen III, you're no doubt spotting a bit of a theme emerging. It's not enough to take away from the three awesome legendary designs in this generation, mind you (heck, they are this writer's favourites). Another good one, all in all.</p>
<h2>Gen IV - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Diamond, Pearl</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_platinum">Platinum</a></h2>

<p>Pokémon really got off to a great start on the DS with this trio. The legendaries look awesome, the dark backdrop suggested there was some drama underneath, and Platinum's glittery sheen is as eye-catching as they come.</p>
<h2>Gen V - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Black &amp; White</a> (2)</h2>


<p>The fact that Pokémon White had Zekrom and Black had Reshiram never sat well with this writer, but we just know that dragon-obsessed kids all over the world lost their minds at these covers — and rightly so!</p>
<p>The '2' variants simply dial things up to 11, and there's no arguing with that.</p>
<h2>Gen VI - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a></h2>

<p>The series burst into the 3D generation with this pair of covers. The '<em>Look! New legendaries!</em>' format returns from previous games, but we were always particularly fond of the giant 'X' and 'Y' in the backgrounds.</p>
<h2>Gen VII - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun &amp; Moon</a> (Ultra)</h2>


<p>Our apologies to the Sun and Moon fans out there, but we always found Solgaleo and Lunala to be a little bit... boring. The bright sky backgrounds of each help elevate the covers, it's true, and the Ultra variants spice things up even more (much like Black 2 and White 2 before them). But is it enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the others?</p>
<h2>Gen VIII - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Sword &amp; Shield</a></h2>

<p>New box shape alert! Pokémon covers went portrait in the Switch generation, and how did TPC make use of all that extra space? With two big old legendary dogs, armoured up to the teeth. Fair play.</p>
<h2>Gen IX - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a></h2>

<p>And so we arrive at the latest generation. Say what you will about Gen IX's Koraidon and Miraidon, there's something about the art style here that we find really rather appealing. Perhaps it's the splattered background or the gold trim border, but does anyone else find these unexpectedly... classy?</p>

<p>"There's kind of a part of me that lives on forever"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As you might recall, the All Elite Wrestling star and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> fan Kenny Omega helped out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>'s Year 3 DLC announcement, but it didn't actually end there.</p>
<p>Ahead of the return of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_iii_new_generation">Street Fighter III: New Generation</a> rep Alex this month, Capcom has shared a new video showcasing the pro wrestler's involvement in motion capture for this particular fighter. As part of this, Kenny has also shed some light on the entire process during an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aews-kenny-omega-brings-alex-to-life-for-street-fighter-6-ign-fan-fest-2026">interview with IGN</a>, mentioning how Capcom was very open to his suggestions and also included his signature moves.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he revealed his participation in the motion cap was actually a result of a misunderstanding on his end, and it led to him, fellow pro wrestler Michael Nakazawa, and Capcom hammering out a session in a single day. Here's exactly how it unfolded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something."</p>
<p>"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex will be followed by the DLC character Ingrid later this year. You can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/61agyx2rvmg">full video interview with Kenny Omega</a> on YouTube. Capcom has also announced it's got JAM Project on board to contribute to the original BGM track "Go! Alex! Hope is Born! - Alex's theme".</p>
