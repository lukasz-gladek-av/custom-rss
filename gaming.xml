		<p>The RGG Like a Dragon Direct gave us a good long look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> gameplay, showcasing the game’s various locations, combat systems (on land and on sea), crew building and more. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 21st February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="RGG Like a Dragon Direct | 1.9.25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/viAEO_cMqfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii really leans in on the craziness that is Goro Majima, who now takes the lead on this latest spin-off. Washing him up on the shores near Hawaii he is quickly confronted by pirates and goes off on an off-kilter adventure filled with buccaneer brawling, crew building and ship-to-ship combat.</p>
<p>On land, Goro has multiple combat styles to use in battles that might start to nudge this series into the realms of a musou. Mad Dog style will look and feel relatively familiar to the classic Yakuza series, emphasising fisticuffs and short swords with speed and agility, dodging and blocking, taking to the air, before unleashing charged moves, whirlwind slashing, building up to the ultimate Suspicious Men move, summoning shadowy doppelgangers to fight alongside you.</p>
<p>Sea Dog style then leans in on dual wielded short swords, grapple hooks, muskets and the like. You can fling the cutlasses like boomerangs, chain hook to close the gap, and blast away with pistols. Whip out guitar, violin and saxophone in a pinch to summon Dark Gods – Curse of the Man-Eating Shark, Curse of the Electrifying Jellyfish, Curse of the Sadistic Ape, Curse of the Cyclonic Avian. Crazy stuff.</p>

<p>On the seas, you’ll build up your grand galleon as you see fit and then hire a crew to man it. You can train them, deepen bonds through song, drink and adventure, and more. Of course, your ship needs to be armed to the teeth with broadside cannons, front-firing rocket launchers, lasers miniguns, walls of flame and more. Assign crewhands strategically to max out the attack and defence stats.</p>
<p>The ship combat looks like a ridiculous over-the-top modern take on Black Flag, if I’m honest, and you can crash into enemies and board rival ships to take out their captain.</p>
<p>It’s not all fighting, and you can retreat back to base at Rich Island. This is where Goro woke up with no memories of who he is, teaming up with Noah Rish and tiger cub friend Goro. Rest up here, restock supplies, rehabilitate animal friends, and more.</p>
<p>Alternatively head to other nearby islands like Madlantis, where pirate lords make their home. This is the hub for minigames with gambling, minigolf, and the Pirates’ Coliseum where you can test your crew against all comers. Nele Island is home to ex-Yakuza who’ve moved there… to help clean up nuclear waste, of all things. And there’s always Hawaii itself, as seen in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Infinite Wealth</a>.</p>
<p>It looks huge and completely ridiculous, and we can’t wait for this to land next month!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Beyond Citadel Review - Proclaimers and Disclaimers]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers.1078398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Get used to messing up the correct year on your documents for a while, because 2025 is hot on its heels after the true trash fire that was 2024. Still, you should always look to the start of the year to set your standards for what’s to come, and if <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is anything to go by? Well, then the year is going to get <em>weird</em>.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from solo Japanese developer Doekuramori, and the long-awaited sequel to their 2020 <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" rel="nofollow"><em>DOOM</em></a>-like FPS <em>The Citadel</em>. You play as “The Martyr”, humanity’s only hope against a heavenly mandate which has caused the near-extinction of Earth’s population, reducing it to a meager 144,000. After the Martyr’s brother sacrifices himself to save her from an angelic demise, she sets it upon herself to settle the score against heaven and hell, with both parties having used what’s left of the world for separate nefarious gains.</p>

<p>Got all that? Good, because the game will rarely mention it again. What’s transcribed from the story is settled between small, somewhat scanty NPC conversations and loading screen tips, and even then, the clarity is dubious. At times, it works in the game's favor, mostly due to some fantastic world-building efforts from Doekuramori, demonstrating how well and truly bunged up Earth is in the aftermath of these events.</p>



<p>Still, it must be said that <em>Beyond Citadel</em> does suffer from some rather unfortunate translation errors, which can distort the presentation of some character moments and story beats. It’s never something truly egregious that can ruin the mood, but with the aforementioned scanty storytelling, your mileage may vary in regards to how an unusual vernacular or punctual typo can ruin your immersion.</p>

<p>Not that this gets in the way of the gameplay, as <em>Beyond Citadel</em> sets its sights on some truly tactical combat, the likes of which you rarely see in this format. The 2.5D sprite work and blocky maps return from the original, with a lot of upgrades in regards to firearm functionality, and accurate weapon handling. Doekuramori cites, among the more obvious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-marathon" rel="nofollow"><em>Marathon</em></a>, the oft-forgotten LucasArts FPS <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/outlaws-game-series-wed-like-to-see-resurrected" rel="nofollow">Outlaws</a> </em>when it comes to <em>Beyond Citadel</em>’s inspirations, and that becomes a true statement when your first weapon is a beastly carbine repeater.</p>

<p>The actual flow and cadence of combat is fantastic. Once you get into the routine of unloading, reloading, and pulling the bolt back, you will have some outrageously fun firefights, punctuated by some varied arenas and adequate pacing to suit. The AI isn’t nearly as tactical as the gameplay around it, which is why <em>Beyond Citadel</em> focuses more on enemy placement and weapon variety to elevate the intensity this combat can exhibit.</p>



<p>When it works, it’s some of the best combat in this boomer-shooter/<a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/tightwads-brutal-wolfenstein" rel="nofollow"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a>-esque space.&nbsp; When it doesn’t, that’s when you’ll be dealing with the bosses, who bookend each separate act in their biblically accurate format. It’s a tried and true testament that most boomer-shooter bosses tend to deflate the excitement that precedes it, and <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is no exception, relying mostly on an overwhelming battalion of ads to punctuate each fight against some of God’s rowdiest outliers.</p>

<p>It’s not like the game is hard either. Where the difficulty lies in how well you gel with the weapon handling mechanics, as infinite lives and checkpoints exist within each level, so the name of the game is endurance. Both thematically and mechanically, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is about rhythm, struggle, and the sheer unbreakable will of human survival.</p>

<p>Mind you, it’s not all perfect. Despite some fantastic pacing toward the second half of <em>Beyond Citadel</em>’s firefights, the final act is a gimmick in and of itself, introducing a brand new movement mechanic that plays awkwardly in the 2.5d format. At the game's worst, it becomes a firing range, and nowhere is it showcased better than in its final steps.</p>



<p>When you compare <em>Beyond Citadel</em> and <em>The Citadel</em> side-by-side, it’s easy to see what’s been kept thematically relevant, what’s improved, and what appears to be a downgrade. The biggest outlier of the supposed downgrades is the visual design, with the game favoring much greyer and constricting skyboxes in their fidelity and saturation. With that said, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> seems to favor scale in this instance, with whole cities to traverse in mechs and pulls it off brilliantly.</p>

<p>There’s also the elephant in the room, which is the applied anime style of “ero-guro”, or erotic gore. Ultraviolence is expected in the medium, sure, but watch with a certain horror as each enemy you face, and indeed yourself, is likely to become a well-drawn, albeit horrifying gibbed cadaver of a young woman beneath their battle armor and angelic upgrades. On top of that, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> also has a gallery, which expands as you find secret artwork within the levels, including art that is either narratively relevant or softcore pornography.</p>

<p>Is it exploitative? Yes. Can it be mean-spirited? At the worst of times, yes. Is it a downgrade from <em>The Citadel</em>? No, don’t be silly. In the 4 years since the original, it’s clear Doekuramuri is maturing, well past the teething phase as they truly get to grips with the world they’ve created, and find themselves focusing more on removing pretension. More importantly, there’s an effort on how to apply the context of this ero-guro aesthetic to the narrative without feeling like both occupy different spaces for different reasons.</p>



<p>It can be off-putting at first, but once <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is given some space to breathe and expand, not even inaccurate translations can dissuade the genuinely inspired posturing of a crisis of faith. Whether or not The Martyr is a good catalyst for this becomes a side-show considering the uhh, blasphemous reasons as to why they’re here in the first place. What takes the Martyrs’ place is an argument of individuality, exasperation at the supposed will of the chosen people, mixed in with some mildly juvenile nihilism.</p>

<p>After all, man proposes, but God disposes.</p>

<p>Still, this isn’t to say that the ero-guro elements have an objectively adequate element to exist alongside this philosophical - potentially pretentious - pondering, pertaining to processing Pantheism. In its purest essence, this is a mileage-may-vary FPS depending on whether or not you can stand one element enough to subject yourself through the rest. The answer to that being just as nebulous as <em>Beyond Citadel</em> itself.</p>

<h2><em>Beyond Citadel </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>From most standpoints taken, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a clear improvement on its 2020 counterpart, both narratively and mechanically. It’s still not leaps and bounds beyond, as the game struggles to truly let its FPS core roam free, and the storytelling tends to waver in its briskness, but there’s a world here that seeks to be worthy. As we all seek to be.</p>

The ol’ dog was introduced in the 2017 <em>Doctor Strange </em>comics as the sorcerer’s pet. Strange cast an enchantment on Bats allowing him to communicate with people, but this was short-lived as the dog soon passed away due to a heart attack after a confrontation with Loki. Bats would later return to Strange’s side as a ghost, however, maintaining his speech capabilities and acting as the hero’s companion.</p><p>In the trailer for <em>Marvel Rivals’</em> new season, which includes a map based on Doctor Strange’s base of operations, NetEase teased that Bats would make an appearance, and now that some players are exploring the inner halls of the Sanctum Santorum, it’s been revealed that Bat hangs out in the lobby.</p><p>I’m a casual Marvel fan and most of my exposure to its heroes comes from the MCU and video games, so I had no idea that Bats existed until recently. It seems like that’s the case for a lot of <em>Rivals </em>fans who are also finding out about the ghost dog’s existence through the shooter. Longtime comic fans are excited to see a more niche side of the Marvel universe represented. I just met Bats but I would die for him, and seeing so many fans share cute moments between him and Marvel heroes has endeared him to me real quick. Also, he’s a Spider-Man fanboy? NetEase, please put in some kind of interaction between the two if a Spidey player is in the room with him.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a pretty expansive roster already, but within its maps and lore drops, it’s found ways to integrate other characters beyond the ones pushing payloads and capturing objectives. So thank you to NetEase for bringing Bats into my life. Let me pet him in the spawn room.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A CS2 skin wear rating is a crucial component in determining the value of the skin itself. Counter-Strike’s massive skin economy is made up of hundreds of thousands of skins. The wear rating of a skin can determine whether a skin is worth tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into what CS2 skin wear rating is, what determines it, and how it affects a skin’s price.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What is CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p>A wear rating is <strong>a numerical value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, that determines the amount of wear on a specific CS2 skin</strong>. The higher the wear rating, the more used and rugged it appears. The lower the wear rating, the more new and clean it appears. Wear rating is also commonly referred to as float value.</p>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>A Factory New Asiimov AK-47 skin.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>A Battle-Scarred Asiimov AK-47 skin.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The wear rating directly determines what a skin’s exterior classification is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.00 to 0.07 are considered Factory New</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.07 to 0.15 are considered Minimal Wear</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.15 to 0.38 are considered Field-Tested</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.38 to 0.45 are considered Well Worn</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.45 to 1.00 are considered Battle-Scarred</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For virtually all skins, items that are Factory New buy and sell for much higher than any of the other exteriors. Then it’s usually a sharp drop to Minimal Wear prices, and then another sharp drop to the higher wear exterior prices. Skins that are closer to the 0.00 rating will sell for much more, even more than other Factory New skins. If you’re looking at Factory New skin listings on the marketplace, the cheapest ones are the ones closest to the 0.07 threshold.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-determines-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What Determines CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p><strong>A CS2 skin’s wear rating is determined when it is opened from a case</strong>. Skins are not guaranteed to be Factory New or Minimal Wear when opened from a case. It’s also a common misconception that CS2 skins degrade over time with use. Wear rating does not increase over time with use.</p>



<p>Many skins can only be opened within a specific exterior classification. Doppler knives, among <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive CS2 skins</a>, can only be opened as Factory New or as Minimal Wear, for example.</p>

The NPC's appearance matches Ibelin's look in the documentary, though it's currently unclear where players will be able to find Ibelin in-game or what he might have to say should players interact with him.</p><p dir="ltr">Steen suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and played WoW as a means of socializing and connecting with others. His character Ibelin, who he often roleplayed as, labeled himself as a private investigator and would use his in-game job title as a means to strike up conversation.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Blizzard has paid tribute to Steen, who passed away in 2014. He is also honored in-game with a gravestone in Elwynn Forest. Blizzard more recently offered the Reven Pack, a bundle of cosmetics (including an adorable fox in a detective hat) inspired by Steen.

			<p>Hitman World of Assassination has officially reached over 75 million players worldwide, which means that this game is the most successful Hitman game of all time. This new was announced today by IO Interactive, the developer and publisher behind the incredibly popular franchise. Since its launch, Hitman World of Assassination has now surpassed 75 million players worldwide. This milestone is just another checkmark for the team, as they have known the success of the game since it was first released. This title has achieved the franchise's highest Metacritic score with the release of Hitman III in 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the franchise, Hitman World of Assassination is a bit more unique, as it allows players to be stealthy while also getting stuck into dramatic action, and allows players to come up with a multitude of ways to assassinate a target or knock them out and hide them.</p>
<p>The game has plenty of interesting characters to get to know or even assassinate, and there are tons of opportunities to carry out a contract. Hitman World of Assassination doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, either.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN: World of Assassination - The Splitter  (featuring @JCVDWorld ) Mission Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xS2zKlpYVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the release of this game, there have been a ton of updates, adding in new live content that contains new locations, contracts, events, and even collaborations with famous people who then get to become a contract in the game. December saw a million active players, and the game continues to remain popular and played by many. 2025 will get more missions for players to run through, as new updates are released by the team hard at work.</p>
<p>Most recently, players were given the opportunity to see Jean-Claude Van Damme in Hitman World of Assassination as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-cut-ties-with-conor-mcgregor-after-court-ruling/">Elusive Target</a> Max Valliant, who is a former ICA operative and others already thought he had been eliminated years ago, but was found to be alive and dealing with secret organizations. This particular mission has been completed by 40% of the players, with a fair few getting far in the mission but struggling to take down the target thanks to his skill set.</p>
<p>One player in particular took more than seven hours to complete the mission, to make sure that they were as thorough as possible in the mission before assassinating the target. Contrasting this playthrough, the fastest player ended the mission within 21 seconds.</p>
<p>The Splitter will be available in Hitman World of Assassination until January 12, giving players the opportunity to try out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new mission</a> before it disappears.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft are delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, but this time, not just out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">concern about the quality of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow. </p><!--more-->
<p>Quite what this means is open to speculation, but it was recently rumoured that Ubi's First Family the Guillemot brothers have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">conspiring with Tencent to buy the company out</a>, while minority shareholders displeased by the company's falling share price have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">clamouring</a> for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to a strategic investor". So this could be Big. Bigger than a single video game's delay, anyway.</p>
<p>"Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation," reads a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf">"strategic update" from Ubisoft</a>, posted this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft announced today that it has appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders," it continues. "This process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materializes."</p><p>Ubisoft have been somewhat up the creek financially for a while, losing almost half their share value in 2024, partly due to the "soft" performance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. As such they've been cutting back. In December, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">discontinued PvP shooter XDefiant and laid off around 277 people</a>. According to today's statement, shuttering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> involved the closure of "three production studios in high-cost geographies" - as in, regions where wages are higher.</p>
<p>The company "will continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a highly selective approach to investments", the statement goes on. Ubisoft now expect to reduce their "fixed cost base" (in other words, costs that consist of more predictable, recurring business expenses, like employee salaries) by €200 million for the fiscal year 2025-2026, compared to 2022-2023 on an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualize.asp">annualised</a> basis.</p>
<p>And then there's the delaying of Shadows, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">moderately promising historical opus</a> which appears to have far too much riding on it in the wake of Outlaws.</p>
<p>"Additionally, as part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences, it has been decided to provide an additional month of development to Assassin's Creed Shadows," Ubisoft write. "This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community. The game is now scheduled for March 20."</p><p>I do not have the insight to play soothsayer about Ubisoft's fortunes here. I will end instead by pointing you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">this bracingly weary Alice0 (RPS in peace) article from 2022</a>, in which CEO Yves Guillemot talks up Ubisoft's independence while also stating that, of course, they'd happily sell the farm to anybody with a really, really large amount of money.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Things start off not too tough: there’s an obvious crash site with an obvious landmark. Later levels get a little more tricky: which wooden bridge are you standing on, based on where some towers are? I struggled for ages with where to position myself related to a set of stairs by some teleporters, because here is where I admit that despite being a 43-year-old man I still sometimes have to turn my whole body or my phone around to understand how to parse a basic Google Map.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Locator - Early Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_qCQCyxVtE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some levels have little puzzles that involve using the missing archeologist’s notebook. One photo is completely dark, but she’s named the statues she’s near, so you can guess where you might be based on that. The level I’m currently wrangling with involves figuring out where in a cluster of beachside huts I am; the archeologist’s notes tell you that huts can only have one of two kinds of doorways, which is helping me narrow things down somewhat (there are triangle doors in one photo, so I can’t be at the huts I previously IDed as having circle doors), but my brain is trying to do so many things at once: determine which cluster the photo is referring to based on its shape or landmarks, turn the overhead view of the map into the on-the-ground view of the photos, and then imagine walking in this imagined 3D space to figure out an exact location.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Empty Exhibit</figcaption></figure><p><em>Locator</em> validates your guesses in sets of three, so I sometimes ran into the situation of setting myself on the wrong path based on an initial wrong guess before learning it was wrong. When the demo opens up a bit, not restricting you to three puzzles at a time, it’s a little easier to come back to wrong guesses or tricky puzzles. Not all the photos and clues are in order, which adds another level of complication: recreating the chronology of the archeologist’s journey to understand her progression through the photos on top of everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I can see the <em>Geoguessr</em> similarities in the core concept and design, but in its narrative, <em>Locator</em> is very different. To me, the fun in <em>Geoguessr</em> (which I also suck at) is learning about new areas of the world; here, it’s more about the spatial puzzle and locating yourself on the ground than imagining different parts of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a positively abysmal sense of direction despite being someone who regularly propels himself <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great</a><a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> distances</a> on <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1589379291703574529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">foot</a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/bike-road-davis-comic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike</a>, which means the constant companion on most of my adventures is Ride With GPS’ “you’re going the wrong way” chime. While playing <em>Locator</em>, I’ve been tilting my head or spinning my chair as I hold a photo and a map in my mind. You, a person who is maybe more fit for basic survival on the corporeal plane than me, might have to do less of this silly choreography. But I’m really digging what <em>Locator</em> is doing and curious to see where the full game goes. There’s no release date yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced another&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>delay, with the upcoming open-world action RPG now set to launch around a month on from its most recent release date.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">m</a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">essage</a> on social media platform X, the new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>release date is March 20th. The game was previously set to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">release on Valentine's Day</a>, having originally been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for a November 2024 launch</a> when it was first unveiled.</p>

<p>In the message, Ubisoft says it's delaying&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>in order to implement "valuable feedback" from the game's community and to "ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march-naoe.jpg?itok=Pj4bWr2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march-naoe.jpg?itok=0fkN3V4N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft reveals a little more of its rationale for delaying&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. The studio says it wants to "create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>community".</p>

<p>This may or may not be a veiled reference to an ongoing controversy surrounding&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, one which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">pertains specifically to co-protagonist Yasuke</a>.</p>

<p>Some have argued that Yasuke is portrayed in a historically inaccurate and disrespectful light in&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, while opponents to that view have argued that the issue is a dog whistle which hides unsavory prejudicial views on the part of its proponents.</p>

<p>Of course, it's also worth noting that in the press release, Ubisoft says holiday sales for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>were "lower than expected", which may have caused the company to panic and push <i>Shadows&nbsp;</i>back in order to ensure it's in a better state at launch to drive sales.</p>




<p>Last time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>was delayed, Ubisoft admitted that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed, and it's likely that a tentpole release with a major IP attached to it achieving low sales is a huge driver for the company wanting to ensure&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is a success.</p>

<p>Ubisoft also says in the aforementioned press release that it has "appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders".</p>

<p>Reading between the corporate speak lines, it's likely this refers to the Guillemots' and Tencent's ongoing conversations regarding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">potentially taking the company private</a>, among other options.</p>

<p>Those conversations are only likely to be growing more urgent thanks to the aforementioned underperformance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">recent cancellation of live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em></a>&nbsp;and the closure of two Ubisoft studios.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will now arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 20th (assuming it's not delayed again, of course).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New day, new Nintendo Switch 2 leaks. Nintendo is getting ever-closer to its April 2025 deadline to reveal its Switch successor, but thanks new renders <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">from OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em></a>, we may now have an even better idea of what the new console might look like.</p><p>If you’ve been following our coverage of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaks</a>, these renders shouldn’t look too surprising. According to the new renders, the console will resemble the original Switch, but it will be bigger, with an 8.4-inch screen. Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p>The renders show that the top of the Switch 2 will feature a power button, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a game card slot, and, new for the Switch 2, a USB-C port. OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> also say that “there also seems to be a sensor of sorts” and they speculate that “this might be an ambient light sensor or something else.” These renders also have a U-shaped kickstand that has appeared in other leaks. </p><p>As for the Joy-Cons, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles’ </em>renders show the mysterious second new button on the right Joy-Con. However, they say the new button is <em>above</em> the Home button; other leaks have included the new button <em>below</em> it. The Joy-Cons in the renders have the large buttons in the back that are apparently used to detach the controllers from the console, which are apparently attached magnetically.</p><p>The renders also show an interesting color scheme for the Joy-Cons: they are mostly black but have color accents — light blue on the left one and orange on the right — under the joystick pads and on the bumped-out part of the controllers with the SL and SR buttons. A similar design popped up earlier this month for an alleged Switch 2 left Joy-Con <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336340/thats-a-nice-blue">with light blue accents</a>. I love it, personally.</p><p>Hopefully, given the tidal wave of recent leaks, we don’t have to wait too much longer for Nintendo to officially announce the new console. But whenever the console actually launches, it’s going to have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">some stiff competition</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options.1078254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has appointed a group of “leading advisors” to assist with exploring company options moving forward. The news comes as part of a special strategic update provided by the company on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” the company said via press release shortly before the call took place.</p>



<p>During the call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that this group of advisors will “review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.” He didn’t give details as to who these advisors are, but did say that things will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Guillemot says that he’s confident that this decision will “position Ubisoft for a stronger future” in the years to come, and that he’s confident there are “several potential paths” forward for the company.</p>







<p>As far as more information into what these paths are, Guillemot wouldn’t divulge. He was asked multiple times for more clarification, but said that he couldn’t say more and wouldn’t comment on “specific rumors” that were circulating. He reiterated, however, different options were being explored.</p>



<p>“We are limited in what we can say today,” he said while stating that the process has already been started with the advisors.</p>



<p>One of those potential paths is rumored to be a buyout by Chinese company Tencent. Guillemot was asked specifically about that possibility as well as the company being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to a “Chinese Military Blacklist”</a> by the United States government. Guillemot, once again, declined to comment on either front.</p>



<p>The update regarding the state of the company comes as Ubisoft announced another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Guilletmot said that the delay was part of the company’s “renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences”.</p>

The brief epilogue at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3 was a crossroads scene in itself, and though he doesn't reference Kingdom Hearts 4 directly, he said an explanation of this epilogue is "a story for another time."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura explained: "Crossroads act as an important point of divergence. To trace it right back, the motif was inspired by the well known crossroad myth from American folklore. The story goes like this: A young man makes a deal with the devil at a crossroads, trading his soul for the ability to play the guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first time a crossroads appears in Kingdom Hearts is in Chain of Memories, which is about losing something to gain something. And in fact, all subsequent appearances of crossroads have the same significance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The greatest example is Birth by Sleep, a story where all three protagonists pay a heavy price to obtain something. But wait... When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tiny, cryptic tease for Kingdom Hearts 4 is the most fans have had in years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event">Despite being revealed in September 2022 with a full cinematic trailer</a>, developer Square Enix has since gone incredibly quiet and, in series tradition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-fans-pine-for-update-on-2nd-anniversary-of-its-announcement">left fans pining for more information</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed flashy gameplay with protagonist Sora but Square Enix said this was from an Unreal Engine 4 demo, whereas <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-earts-4-gameplay-visuals-unreal-enigne-5">the actual game will be made in Unreal Engine 5</a>. It's already been analyzed completely too, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-may-tease-a-star-wars-section">some even think there's evidence of a Star Wars section</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, Nomura has said Kingdom Hearts 4 will, after 22 years and a whopping 18 games, finally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-22-years-and-18-games-kingdom-hearts-4-will-move-the-story-towards-its-end">shift the Kingdom Hearts narrative towards its conclusion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

        <p>And it's coming later this year.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's determined streak of announcing absolutely anything but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> continues today with the news its beloved Game Boy handheld is getting the Lego treatment later this year.
</p>
<p>
This is far from the first time Nintendo has partnered with Lego, of course; the companies have already released an extensive range of interactive Mario-themed sets, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree was also Lego-ised</a> last year. Nor is it the first time a Nintendo console has been immortalised in little plastic block form; a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-nes-leaks-online-costs-over-gbp200">Lego version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System</a> launched back in 2020 - and a lovely thing it was too.
</p>
<p>
And now it's the Game Boy's turn, as revealed in the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1877400377575792847">briefest of video teases</a> shared on Nintendo's social media channels. As the teaser unfolds, we see various Lego pieces glide in seductive soft-focus across the screen, but there's sadly no reveal of the full Lego build just yet.
</p> <div>

<p>
Not that it should be too hard to imagine. Fans have been creating their own Game Boys out of Lego for quite some time now, such as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTs5m4MGt4">delightful effort</a> from video editor and Lego Masters Australia finalist Nick Lever, which was shared online last year.
</p>
<p>
Should more details surface following today's Lego Game Boy tease, I'll update this story. But for now, all we know for sure is that it'll be arriving sometime this October.
