            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-rocket-league-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase Games has revealed a brand new event for hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The Spring Festival event arrives tomorrow, bringing with it a whole new game mode and some shiny new skins.</p>

<p>Kicking off on January 23rd at 9am UTC (that's 4am Eastern and 1am Pacific), the Spring Festival event's main draw is its Clash of Dancing Lions limited-time mode, which will look familiar to you if you've ever played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>.</p>

<p>Teams of three compete against one another on a dedicated map, with each team aiming to gain possession of a ball and make sure it enters the opposing team's scoring zone. Whoever reaches "a predetermined score" first will be declared the winner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=agXvRQcg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=TRUuuJux 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new mode will be familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the event shows Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow competing in the event, but it'll likely be open to all heroes; those are just the characters getting new skins as part of the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, three Clashing Lions-themed skins have been introduced for those heroes. Star-Lord gets a fetching Lion's Mane costume, Black Widow gets a Lion's Heartbeat outfit, and Iron Fist gets a Lion's Gaze look.</p>

<p>They're all essentially themed around the same traditional Chinese lion dance motif, and they all look pretty excellent. At the very least, you'll be able to earn Star-Lord's outfit through "completing tasks", although it isn't clear whether you can earn the other two that way as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>&nbsp;</em>is landing on PC soon, NetEase says a new&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>-themed bundle will be available in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' store, complete with a new outfit for Spidey, as well as a new nameplate and spray. Those are launching on January 30th.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter developed and published by Chinese studio NetEase. Similar in many ways to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, the game pits Marvel heroes like Black Widow, Captain America, and Venom against one another in objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game has proven popular among players, reaching a player count of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million within a 72-hour period</a>. It's also attracted the attention of modders, who have already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround" rel="nofollow">found a way around</a> an apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clampdown on skin modding</a> introduced alongside&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first season.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-thing-after-the-switch-how-overheard-chatter-led-to-a-nintendo-goose-chase/">literal years</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/">speculation and leaks</a>, it was nice to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">an actual glimpse of the Switch 2 hardware</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">its increased size</a>) last week. But even with the console officially "revealed," there's still a wide range of important unknown Switch 2 details that Nintendo has yet to address.</p>
<p>As we wait for the company to dribble out additional information in the coming weeks and months, we thought we'd take a quick look at the biggest outstanding questions and concerns we still have about Nintendo's next gaming platform, along with some analysis of what we know, what we can guess, and what we expect on each score.</p>
<h2>Launch date?</h2>
<p>The teaser trailer's promise of a "2025" Switch 2 release technically covers any launch date between "tomorrow" and December 31. But we can probably narrow that window down a bit.</p>
<p>For one, Nintendo promised "a closer look at Switch 2" in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html">a Direct video presentation scheduled for April 2</a>. It would be a little weird for that "closer look" to come after the console itself was launched, so a launch before April seems out of the question.</p>

<p>Nintendo is also planning <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/">a series of worldwide "Nintendo Switch 2" hands-on experiences</a> through which consumers will be able to try the console for themselves. Again, it would be odd to run an exclusive, ticket-limited hands-on experience if the console was already available in stores. The latest Switch Experience event is currently scheduled for May 31 through June 1 in Seoul, South Korea, making a Switch 2 release before June seem unlikely (though a staggered regional rollout could change this calculus).</p>
<p>Before the Switch launched in March of 2017, Nintendo's previous three home consoles all launched in November, dating back to <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/archive/2001/0901-1.html">the GameCube in 2001</a>. Don't be shocked if Nintendo reverts to form and waits until the high-impact holiday sales windows near the end of the 2025 for the Switch 2's release.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Price?</h2>
<p>When the Switch launched in 2017, its $300 price point was actually a little higher than the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2017/02/09/sony-just-gave-ps4-a-price-cut/">contemporary prices for the aging PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/10/15776370/microsoft-xbox-one-s-price-drop-e3-2017">Xbox One</a>. And Nintendo has steadfastly managed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">avoid offering a single price drop</a> on the best-selling console since then (though inflation has lowered the value of that pricing a bit, and the Switch OLED <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">came in at $350 in 2021</a>).</p>

              While the nominal price of the original Switch hasn't changed, inflation has eaten into its "real" price a bit.

<p>In the meantime, Sony has actually raised the PS5's (already significant) launch price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/sony-raises-playstation-5-console-prices-in-many-regions-effective-immediately/">in many regions</a>&nbsp;and has seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">strong initial sales for the $700 PS5 Pro</a>. On the other side, Microsoft's $300 Xbox Series S <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-microsoft-documents-show-the-xbox-series-s-might-be-more-popular-than-you-think">seems to be vastly outselling</a> the $500 Series X, showing there is still quite a bit of sensitivity to console pricing in the market.</p>
<p>Taking all that into account, a $350 to $400 asking price for the Switch 2 doesn't seem out of the question. But Nintendo has surprised us with both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/7743/">lower than expected</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/a-beautiful-screen-a-weak-battery-a-door-to-the-future-ars-reviews-the-nintendo-3ds/">higher than expected</a> hardware launch pricing in the past, so we wouldn't bet the farm on where this one ends up.</p>

<h2>Games?</h2>
<p>While it was neat to see a few brief seconds of what we assume is <em>Mario Kart 9</em> in the Switch 2 teaser trailer, it would be nice to hear more about what first-party games Nintendo has planned for that all-important launch window.</p>

<p>Nintendo could follow the example of the original Switch and launch with a new <em>Zelda</em> title again, but this seems a bit unlikely since we're still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/hands-on-with-tears-of-the-kingdoms-zelda-meets-minecraft-construction-set/">less than two years out from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. A new full-fledged 3D Mario adventure—perhaps expanding on some of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-everything-old-is-new-again/">the open-world ideas from <em>Bowser's Fury</em></a>—seems like a better bet this time around, given how long it has been since 2017's best-selling <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (which continued Nintendo's long tradition of launching a Mario game in a new console's first year).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And let's not forget about <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/seven-years-later-nintendo-proves-metroid-prime-4-still-exists/">officially teased last summer</a>, long after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">its original 2017 announcement</a>. The planned 2025 release seems perfectly aligned to be a big launch title for Nintendo's new system.</p>
<h2>Battery life?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">additional size</a> of the Switch 2 tablet could offer a bit more space to squeeze in some bulky rechargeable batteries. But those batteries will be powering a much larger display this time around, as well as some more powerful internal hardware.</p>
<p>We'd expect this trade to roughly come out as a wash and for the Switch 2 to match the 4.5 to 9 hours of battery life that Nintendo quotes for modern Switch consoles, depending on the game being played.</p>
<h2>Weight?</h2>
<p>At less than a pound, the Switch has always been less heavy to hold for extended periods than modern portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck (1.4 lbs) or the Lenovo Legion Go (1.88 lbs). The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">upsized</a> Switch 2 will likely add a little bit of weight over its predecessor, but we'd be surprised if it ends up significantly heavier on a relative basis.</p>

<p>Nintendo's long history of handheld consoles has always prioritized designs that are comfortable for the smaller hands and arms of younger players. We don't expect that to change significantly for the Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Hardware power?</h2>
<p>Back in 2023, leaks suggested that the Switch 2 would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">powered by an Nvidia T239-based chip</a>. That mobile-focused chip would be a significant step up from the Tegra X1 in the original Switch—which was considered slightly underpowered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-switch-nvidia-tegra-x1-specs-speed/">even when it launched in 2017</a>—but still only roughly equivalent to <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2050-mobile.c3859">a 2021-era RTX 2050 Mobile chipset</a>&nbsp;as far as graphical performance is concerned. Still, that would be enough for some fancy graphical features like hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and DLSS upscaling on at least some games.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">a speculative piece</a> based on those leaks, Digital Foundry said this kind of chipset could likely manage a "far from pristine" but "decent [upscaled] image on a 4K living room TV." That seems like a reasonable guess, and it could be a good excuse for publishers to re-release new versions of some late PS4/early PS5-era hits for Nintendo's next portable.</p>
<h2>Screen resolution/quality?</h2>
<p>The 720p screen on the original Switch was a revelation after decades of Nintendo handhelds with notably low-resolution screens. Since the launch of the 800p Steam Deck in 2022, though, most portable PC makers have opted for a full 1080p display or higher for their handheld offerings.</p>
<p>Increased resolution could be even more important on the Switch 2 if Nintendo wants to maintain a decent pixels-per-inch ratio on the new console's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">expanded screen size</a>. Previous Nintendo consoles like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">Switch OLED</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-review-return-to-the-third-dimension/">3DS XL</a> show what happens when you expand the screen real estate but not the pixel resolution of an existing platform.</p>

<p>While a full 1080p screen would likely increase the Switch 2's materials cost a bit, it's a price Nintendo is likely ready to pay to show off the power of the Switch 2 in portable mode. Don't expect a pricey OLED screen at launch, though—if the Switch is any indication, Nintendo will save that for a mid-generation upgrade in a few years.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with old hardware?</h2>
<p>While Nintendo has stressed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">your old Switch software will still work on the Switch 2</a>, it has so far been less clear on whether all your old Switch controllers and accessories will be compatible with the new console.</p>
<p>First- and third-party Switch controllers simply use the Bluetooth standard, which Nintendo seems overwhelmingly likely to keep using for the Switch 2. Given that, there's little reason that wireless Switch controllers shouldn't continue to work on the Switch 2. The same goes for wired USB controllers and wired accessories like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/your-old-gamecube-controllers-now-work-with-the-nintendo-switch/">the GameCube controller adapter</a>.</p>

<p>Using your old Switch Joy-Cons in portable mode is a different matter, as the Switch 2 seems to lack the physical plastic "rail" needed to slide those controllers into place. But since the Switch 2 comes packaged with new, larger Joy-Cons, there aren't many situations where you would need to physically connect your old controllers anyway.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 teaser trailer briefly showed a more rounded Switch 2 dock, suggesting that the new console might not be able to connect via docks designed for the original console. What's currently unclear is whether that dock upgrade is primarily cosmetic or houses some new internal circuitry necessary for upscaling Switch 2 games on the big screen.</p>
<h2>Improved performance for old games?</h2>
<p>If you own a Switch, you're probably used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/dooms-switch-port-playable-but-a-distinct-visual-downgrade/">stuttering frame rates</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-switcher-is-real-witcher-3-on-switch-is-a-blurry-tolerable-compromise/">other performance issues</a> on the system's more taxing 3D titles. The additional hardware power of the Switch 2 could theoretically help these legacy games run more smoothly, much as it does for backward-compatible software on recent Sony and Microsoft systems.</p>
<p>Nintendo will likely follow its competitors' lead in this regard to some extent. The biggest question is how much work developers will need to put in to unlock the best performance for original Switch games on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>On the PlayStation 5 Pro, for instance, developers have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/">needed to patch in "Enhanced" versions</a> to take full advantage of the console's power. Titles without those specially designed patches simply get a less optimized "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-significant-improvements-final-fantasy-xvi-xiv/">can still offer some significant improvements</a>.</p>
<h2>Switch Online?</h2>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed your current Switch Online account will still work with the Switch 2. But the company hasn't confirmed which perks from that subscription will carry over to the new system.</p>

<p>The expansive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/welcome-to-nes-flix-testing-nintendo-onlines-new-8-bit-library-on-switch/">Switch Online classic game library</a> is the biggest perk in question here. Since the Switch 2 is backward-compatible with old Switch software, it would be a bit odd to suddenly cut off the emulated game library that is a core of the Switch Online experience. But Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">shut down access</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/rip-virtual-console-nintendo-will-shut-off-wii-u-3ds-game-downloads/">officially emulated games in the past</a>, so it's not out of the question.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Switch Online subscriptions haven't increased in price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/">since they started in late 2018</a>, despite years of higher-than-normal inflation. The launch of a new console could serve as a good excuse for Nintendo to foist a price increase onto consumers.</p>

                <p>Ask any collector of Game Boy Advances games what their holy grail is, and chances are high that Ninja Five-O is on that list. A cult-classic action game released by Konami way back in 2003, physical GBA copies are typically listed for a very high price on the reseller market, but fortunately, you can save quite a bit on its upcoming digital release for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch on February 25. Over on Fanatical, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fninja-five-o&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fone-of-konamis-best-gba-games-releases-on-steam-next-month%2F1100-6528930%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can score a 25% discount on a Ninja Five-O preorder</a>, as the game is available there for just $18.74.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557"></a><figcaption>Ninja Five-O</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg"></figure><p>If you've never played it, Ninja Five-O puts you in the jika-tabi footwear of Joe Osugi, a detective who solves crime in the city of Zipangu with his analytical mind and ninja skills. Just like in the original GBA game, you'll take on the evil Mad Mask gang using your ninjutsu, and for anyone looking for a real challenge, you can put your ninja arts to the test with a Time Trial mode. Quality-of-life updates include quick-saves and the option to rewind the game at any time to help you get through some of the tougher stages.</p><p>Anyone looking to score a physical edition of Ninja Five-O can also check out Limited Run Games for a hard copy. Currently, these all appear to be sold out but it is worth bookmarking the site in case there's a resupply in the future.

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>will be launching on March 19th, 2027. Obviously, that date is more than two years away, but hey, I suppose&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie fans need something to look forward to.</p>

<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>won't necessarily be the movie's final title, but if it follows the naming conventions of its two predecessors, then it probably won't bear any kind of secondary name. Don't expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4: The Rise of Robotnik&nbsp;</em>or anything anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=XODQS-Vq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=NIohTK_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie will be hitting theaters in March 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">report back in December</a> (also courtesy of Variety) already revealed that a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie was confirmed before the proverbial ink on the third one was dry, but now we know exactly when we can expect it.</p>

<p>Of course, we still don't know what kind of story details we can expect from the movie, although the post-credits scenes included in the third installment are probably strong clues as to where it's headed.</p>

<p>The third movie's post-credits scenes (look away now if you don't want spoilers!) confirm that Shadow survived the events of the film, and they also tease the appearance of both Metal Sonic and Amy Rose in the next movie.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>to focus on both characters, and Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be returning as well. Naturally, all of this is speculation until the movie is officially revealed.</p>




<p>The existence of a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie makes a lot of sense given how well the previous three have done in financial terms.</p>

<p>According to Paramount, between them, the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>films have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and since that report was released earlier this month, that number's likely to be higher by now as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>releases on March 19th, 2027. Don't expect to hear anything more about the movie for a while given how far off that date is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/supermaster-v-marvel-rivals-ranked-bug-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Supermaster V ranked bug is a literal marvel in Marvel Rivals. You’d think it has positive connotations and signifies progress in Rivals, but it’s a strange occurrence with drastic outcomes for ranked matches. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals ranked mode is where the elite go to fight. It’s where the dedicated want to prove themselves and ascend to higher levels of greatness, before eventually applying to join the Avengers. With Shroud looking at starting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivals Esports organization</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s director already discussing Esports plans</a>, ranked is the first step on the road to major competitive play. </p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals ranked play is being impacted by a Supermaster V bug. Let’s take a look at everything we know about it and what it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-causes-supermaster-v-bug-in-marvel-rivals">What Causes Supermaster V Bug in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Has this happened to you? Credit to X user and streamer @whyAndr3w</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Supermaster V is a post-game bug happening <strong>when a ranked match is considered invalid—due to insufficient players, AFK action, or forfeiting.</strong></strong></p>



<p>These issues can be attributed to connection issues, users being idle, or rage-quitting. In short, if your ranked match goes off without a hitch, it’s sure to be a valid encounter where everything is presented and shown as normal. If any of the above happens, Supermaster V may land to spoil your day.</p>



<p>It only appears at the end of a Marvel Rivals ranked match, and I can confirm it’s not one of the official tiers in the Rivals ranked system.</p>



<p>NetEase has yet to formally address the Supermaster V error. We’re trying to piece together what we can from various players’ experiences. You can see X user <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@whyAndr3w</a>‘s game above where they encountered the bug and <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w/status/1878800368580391230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted about it</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-supermaster-v-bug-change-your-online-rank-in-marvel-rivals">Does Supermaster V Bug Change Your Online Rank in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Your online rank being affected by Supermaster V is inconclusive, but based on what we’ve seen, it doesn’t appear you are penalized too heavily if it happens.</strong></p>



<p>Anyone in an invalid lobby who is hit by the Supermaster V bug is susceptible to an <strong>AFK ban</strong>. It’s not confirmed to be a guarantee, but I’ve seen several examples of players complaining about this.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/578249962076305125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam user EXtremist said</a>, “The game shows me a Supermaster [V] message, after winning, and then I get a <strong>15-minute penalty for being disconnected</strong>, which never happened. This is [the] 3rd time.” Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/591758265559292113/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam player shared their story</a>, “I was in a ranked game and everyone had poor connection midway through. I hit 1000 ping at one point, [and] at the end I got the ranked progress, it says 20/30, and the rank was Supermaster V.”</p>



<p>Not every case seems to be the same though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnqkmi/saying_my_rank_is_supermaster_v_after_competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JDlyndon on the Marvel Rivals subreddit</a> shared a picture of the Supermaster V screen. They said they “Played and won a game of competitive and instead of getting a normal ranked points gain screen I got this.” They add “<strong>There was no AFK in the match” and it went down like a normal ranked match</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the findings aren’t absolute right now. Keep checking back as we find out the latest on Supermaster V, and if NetEase comments.</p>



<hr>



<p>Have you had Supermaster V happen to you after playing a Marvel Rivals ranked match? Did you get an AFK ban? Have you lost any ranking points as a result?</p>

A cold, almost heartless beauty, she always says what’s on her mind, even if it means offending others. She’s just as merciless on the battlefield, where she gets a twisted sense of pleasure from tearing invaders apart.</li><li><strong>Tsubasa Kawana</strong> (voiced by Ayane Sakura) – A girl who knows a lot about machines and what makes them tick. She had a bright, lively personality, but isn’t good with stressful situations. When she gets nervous, she gets nauseous, and then…</li><li><strong>Gaku Maruko</strong> (voiced by Kensho Ono) – A guy who’s true to his personal desires (to put it delicately). He’s a coward and always looking out for himself. However, there’s something so refreshingly honest about his pettiness that it’s hard to hate him. Gaku’s also good at taking care of other people once he opens his heart to them.</li><li><strong>Kyoshika Magadori</strong> (voiced by Marina Inoue) – A young samurai who’s utterly clueless about the modern world. Has never even heard of multiplication tables, let alone learned them. She has a disturbingly close relationship with her katana, the Holy Jumonji Sword.</li><li><strong>Yugamu Omokage</strong> (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) – A boy who’s been in the business of killing since long before the war started. Unlike the rest of his family (who are also assassins, by the way), Yugamu believes that killing should be done with love. He enjoys torture and other immoral forms of pleasure.</li><li><strong>SIREI</strong> (voiced by Otsuka Hochu) – The principal and commanding officer of Last Defense Academy. To put it another way, a weird little robot that orders the members of the Special Defense Unit around. Under his command, Takumi and the others will be working to wipe out the mysterious School Invaders.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 24 worldwide.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Boon then tweeted a short clip showing one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which Terminator 2 fans are sure to get a kick out of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see the T-1000 drive a smashed up truck straight into his hapless opponent, rekindling memories of the iconic chase scene in Terminator 2 where the T-1000 drives the same truck in pursuit of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator and Edward Furlong’s John Connor.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">(5 of 7) With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC ! <a href="https://t.co/eC3Aqj5KDc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eC3Aqj5KDc</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s Boon’s comment accompanying the clip that set tongues wagging within the Mortal Kombat community: “With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the line “keep trucking forward with future DLC” may relate to the upcoming release of the T-1000, some are hoping it’s a tease that more DLC characters are set to hit the game once the current set is rounded out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character set to be added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
External hard drives over 16TB in size will soon be supported by Xbox consoles, Microsoft has announced. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of support for bigger external USB storage has been confirmed for Xbox Insiders, as part of a system software update rolling out now to public testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring. As ever, this new feature will slowly filter out to larger testing groups before its widespread public release, typically over the next couple of weeks. 
</p>
<p>
"We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play!" Microsoft wrote in a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200">blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilise all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list."

</figure>
<p>
Intriguingly, Microsoft does not list a new upper limit for storage devices - suggesting that with the partition methodology in place, there is no upper limit anymore. How big a hard drive can you connect?!
</p>
<p>
"Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives," Microsoft concluded.

The next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> project is still growing in size and isn't ready for the bulk of BioWare staff to jump aboard, former studio veteran Mark Darrah has said.
</p>
<p>
Darrah worked at BioWare for 23 years as a project director and executive producer on the Dragon Age series, and has tracked the studio's changing project schedule in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE">newly-public video</a> peering behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
Some BioWare staff who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> are now filtering over to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, but others are being kept busy contributing to projects elsewhere within the wider EA organisation, Darrah said.

<p>
First announced in 2020, Mass Effect 5 (or whatever it ends up being called) has been worked on by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">small team of original Mass Effect trilogy veterans</a> within BioWare while the majority of the company has worked to get Dragon Age: The Veilguard out the door. 
</p><p>
But now The Veilguard has shipped, that doesn't mean Mass Effect 5 will suddenly have the full operational strength of BioWare behind it, Darrah continued, even though the studio had entered an era where it only dedicated the majority of its resources to one project at a time. 
</p>
<p>
"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah noted. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on Anthem or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource, it had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything. 
</p>
<p>
"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]. You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."
</p>
<p>
BioWare previously worked on multiple projects in parallel, such as various entries in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, plus development on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> and - going back further - teams dedicated to handheld development, a cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> sequel, and the Montreal satellite studio which led development on Mass Effect Andromeda, and was subsequently folded into EA's Motive studio.
</p><p>
Having many teams meant moving people between projects might have been easier, Darrah said, but this came with its own issues. For example, having multiple projects also limited that movement, if several games were due to ship in close proximity.
</p>
<p>
"This might be great," Darrah concluded of BioWare's current single-project focus, "because what it means is BioWare, for really the first time ever, is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal: which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."
</p>
<p>
Mass Effect 5 still lacks a release date, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-damps-down-expectations-for-mass-effect-5-news-this-week-ahead-of-franchises-n7-day">last year's N7 Day was a quiet affair as BioWare still heads down on the launch of The Veilguard</a>. Here's hoping things ramp up considerably in 2025.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's Mass Effect head honcho Michael Gamble recently let fans know the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">won't be changing art styles akin to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and dropped a hint that left fans speculating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">the series' Paragon/Renegade system would be returning</a>. 
</p><p>In addition to the next Mass Effect game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon is working on a TV series set within the Mass Effect universe</a>. Commander Shepard voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer earlier this month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says">she'd love to see the trilogy's original cast make an appearance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mobile gaming has for a long time been the most accessible route into video games, and while that used to mean Candy Crush or Angry Birds, the last 12 months have seen the arrival of big hitters like the explosive anime action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a> and the glamorous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/">Infinity Nikki</a>. Netmarble are hoping to continue that trend with the stunning Game of Thrones Kingsroad, the latest entry in George R. R. Martin’s saga.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set to release for PC, Android and iOS, we were able to go hands-on with the latest beta to see just how faithful Kingsroad is to the previous Westeros adventures. Set amongst the melee following Robert Baratheon’s death, you are the bastard child of House Tyre, called north to find out why the Castle Black, home to the Night’s Watch, has gone silent.</p>


<p>You choose initially from three different classes: the Sellsword, a heavy fighter class with a massive axe, the Knight, a classic balance of offence and defence, and the lithe Assassin, a swift and deadly option.</p>
<p>Before you can say “Hero Journey”, you’re swept north of the Wall to seek out Jon Snow and a batch of missing Rangers. It does not go well, and you’re soon fighting off wave after wave of vicious White Walkers. Netmarble have done a fantastic job of capturing the skeletal foe’s terrifying presence, and if you were a fan of the original show, or indeed the actual novels, I think you’ll be all-in from the opening of Kingsroad.</p>


<p>The action-heavy gameplay relies on heavy-hitting melee combat, and your character is equipped from the start with a standard and heavy attack, as well as a bow for more delicate ranged work. They’re joined by a steady flow of skills and abilities, which are perfect for giving you the upper hand when facing the enormous swing of an undead Giant.</p>
<p>This definitely isn’t a Soulslike, but blocking and dodging play an important role in staying alive. It’s approachable and weighty, and, playing with a controller on PC at least, it feels responsive and like a fully-fledged action title rather than a stereotypical mobile game. Times have absolutely changed, and from the opening at least, Kingsroad is exceeding expectations.</p>

<p>The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos.</p>
<p>Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes. Jon Snow looks like Jon Snow – though he doesn’t sound quite right, shorn of Kit Harrington’s performance – and your player character boasts plenty of detail, really bringing the brusque, frosty action to life. The voice acting overall is actually a highlight, with a few moments of wondering whether it’s the original actors or not making way for the enjoyably northern accents that you encounter here in the snow.</p>

<p>Today is the final day for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s open beta</a>, so, if you were lucky enough to nab a spot, there’s still time to jump in and experience Netmarble’s fresh take on George R.R. Martin’s world. Hopefully, we won’t have too long to wait before the game’s full launch, and we can see how just how long and bloody that Kingsroad is.</p>

			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project is now available for download, introducing new visual improvements to the emulated game on PC.</p>
<p>The new version of the impressive fan-made remaster developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fromsoftserve</a>, version 0.84, introduces more pointlights to Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward, Old Yharnam and Cainhurst, while improving the quality of all pointlights in all maps, changing some reflectance maps and more. The changes introduced in the new version of the project, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">Nexus Mods</a>, are showcased in great detail by the project's developer in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Remaster 0.84 is out now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O81LRW6ZHNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's great to see how far the Bloodborne Remaster Project is going, considering a few months ago none of the PlayStation 4 emulators available could emulate the game. The rapid progress made by the ShadPS4 emulator, however, finally made it possible to enjoy one of the best games developed by FromSoftware ever made, alongside a few other <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/">PlayStation 4 exclusives</a> such as Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise.</p>
<p>While fans are developing the Bloodborne remaster Sony doesn't seem interested in releasing, the Japanese company is unlikely to return to the franchise without FromSoftware's involvement. Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">commented</a> on the matter, saying that Hidetaka Miyazaki is definitely interested in returning to the series, having really loved the original game, but he's now so busy that he cannot develop a remaster or a sequel himself, and won't allow anyone else to do so. PlayStation's inaction on the matter, Yoshida theorizes, is because they are respecting his wish.</p>

            <p>If you want to toss a coin to your orchestra, you will soon be able to do just that, as CD Projekt Red has announced ticket sales for The Witcher in Concert will go on sale imminently.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is a celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s 10th anniversary, because it really has been that long (and yet, I haven't aged a day). It will "bring to life the open-world RPG's timeless score with a live orchestra performance". As with other video game-based concerts, gameplay will accompany the music as it swells from the orchestra.</p>
<p>The concert tour itself will kick off during this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> event in Cologne, before traveling across Europe. That includes here in the UK, with the concert coming to London on 5th November, before it heads to Manchester on 7th November.</p>

<p>As well as the UK, the tour has stops in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Sweden all scheduled. Further tour locations will be announced at a later date, including ones across the pond in North America.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it's been 10 years since we first introduced The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to the world! Music is such an important part of our games, and to see the community respond with such enthusiasm for what we created has been truly incredible," said soundtrack co-composer Marcin Przybyłowicz.</p>
<p>"From everyone's favorite 'le le les' to the tracks we used to underscore the most heartfelt moments, every single composition was a joy to create, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with people around the world."</p>
<p>Those interested are able browse the current list of venues and purchase tickets through The Witcher in Concert <a href="http://thewitcher.com/concert">official website</a>. Ticket sales go live on 24th January, so this Friday, however a pre-sale will begin 48 hours prior to this date for those who sign up to the concert's newsletter. So, I guess that means now. Get tossing those coins! (only if you want to, of course).</p>

<p>As for what's still to come for the Witcher series, CD Projekt lifted the lid on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">next video game entry at The Game Awards in December</a>.</p>
<p>Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, the upcoming game stars Ciri as the main protagonist, and will be another third-person action-RPG just like The Witcher 3.

            <p>S-Game has released a new trailer for forthcoming action game Phantom Blade Zero, but it remains without a firm release date.</p>
<p>The new trailer celebrates 2025's Year of the Snake with a fresh gameplay of a boss battle and a look at new snake-themed weapons: the sword-whip Soft Snake Sword, and twin swords White Serpent and Crimson Viper.</p>
<p>The trailer also states a release date will be announced this year, as the developer is continuing to tweak and finalise the game.</p>

<p>In an email to Eurogamer alongside the trailer, S-Game stated the playable demos from last year proved Phantom Blade Zero is already a "polished title", but it's using Unreal Engine 5 to "push the boundaries even further" after a "significant" boost to the budget.</p>
<p>It also confirmed enhanced visuals will be supported on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero was announced by Sony in 2023. Developed by S-Game, it's a hack and slash action game fusing traditional techniques and philosophies of Chinese martial arts with inspiration from the Hong Kong action films of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>This new trailer shows a battle against boss the Seven Judgments - a sort of puppet master with clones. It's a further example of the game's parrying and dodging mechanics, as well as its high difficulty.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on with Phantom Blade Zero</a> at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> and came away impressed by its hugely satisfying combat. Just remember: as the developer said, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">absolutely not a Soulslike</a>.</p>
<p>S-Game CEO Liang Qiwei (known as Soulframe) stated last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-producer-says-foreign-themes-can-be-an-advantage-rather-than-a-barrier-for-a-global-audience">authentic cultural themes are important for games</a> and shouldn't be diluted for a global audience, as the Chinese developer chases the same success as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In the UK, May has hitherto been a month of innocent delight and sacred observance, with no less than two bank holidays. On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.</p>
<p>Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The date in question is 15th May, according to a now-pulled article published by French website Gamekult and passed along by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-spotted-ahead-of-xbox-developer-direct">Eurogamer</a>. I can't confirm this, obviously, but chainsawing the month neatly in two is classic Doom behaviour. Hopefully, we'll get the last word tomorrow. The Dark Ages is one of four games that are publicly slated to appear. The others are Clair Obscura: Expedition 33, South Of Midnight, and a mystery surprise guest. Could be that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">hypothetical Oblivion remaster</a>, though Windows Central are <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress">mongering the rumour</a> that it's the return of an ancient Japanese franchise of some kind.
</p>
<p>
As for what you'll do in the new Doom - there shall be no maypoles and kissing. There shall only be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-comes-rampaging-in-on-a-chainsaw-shield-next-year">chained maces, powdered skulls, and medieval mechs</a>. You'd better <em>hope</em> there are no maypoles and kissing. I'm pretty sure Doomguy could find any number of applications for a maypole, and none of them would be innocent or delightful.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Halo has a history of embracing wacky game modes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> players are seeing that tradition continue this week with a new playlist of game modes. "Action Sack" is a returning playlist for the series. It first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a> as a rotating set of modes that would see you quickly cycling through various deadly minigames, from chaotic rockets-only nukefests to panicky punch-ups with ammoless pistols. This time, the playlist includes a familiar geometric hazard that has seen the death of many a bean: the "hex-a-gone" level from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you've not experienced the adrenal pleasure of a Fall Guys tournament, the goal of this particular minigame is to hop from one perilous tile to the next, escaping each tile as it falls after being used. There are several floors of tiles. Fall into the void, and you're knocked out. It's a pure playground game made manifest in bright colours and bouncing beanpals. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYVNStX1OXA">what it looks like in Fall Guys</a>. </p>
<p>As for how it showed up in the multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, Halo Infinite's Forge mode allows players to create their own modes and minigames. So, of course someone imported this battle-royale-in-miniature. Here, up to 16 Spartans can recreate the twitchy standoffs and desperate divebombs of the game I like to call Heinz' Total Wipeout. It's been a custom mode for a while now, but Halo Studios has now deemed it playful enough to include the mode in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9JfHeLHiNeA">official Action Sack playlist</a>.</p>
<p>It'll sit alongside some other fun nonsense. Goose Hunt sees players driving around a dangerously exposed circular track on Mongoose quad bikes, while one player launches rockets at the drivers. Maze Craze will have you running around an intentionally confusing maze, trying to hide from the one murderous player with a gravity hammer. You can see the other modes in the playlist in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1240440/view/739253661966795641">a post on Steam</a> from the developers. </p><p>All this comes shortly after they formalised another goofy returning mode - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1240440/view/525331314946082049">Castle Wars</a>. This sees two teams standing off in opposing castles with only one direct approach between them. Think of these maps as the spiritual successors to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-facing-worlds-unreal-tournaments-most-popular-map">Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds</a>. They are battles of attrition, and result in many a sniped head. In terms of level design, they should not work at all. And yet... and yet... </p>
<p>I have a lot of time for Halo's player-driven kookiness. As happens within modding scenes, these fan creations can become so popular and well-loved that they get officially folded into the games. The zombie-dodging Infection mode, which sees players fend off a slowly growing team of undead sword-wielding players, was once just a set of playground rules in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> matches, for example. That's probably unlikely for a borrowed novelty like Hex-A-Gone. But I'm glad we still get to see the spirit of modding survive in a popular shooter.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Origins once again asks you to command an army and dominate the battlefield. You need to do this over many hours of gameplay, and Dynasty Warriors Origins has a few chapters to overcome—along with thousands of enemies.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is another exercise in hacking and slashing until it can be done no more. Moving from one arena to another, mercilessly chopping down hundreds of opposing forces. Developer Omega Force has done a good job with Origins as it’s currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated Dynasty Warriors game</a> in history!</p>



<p>A refreshing overhaul of gameplay mechanics, a deeper story, lots of fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dynasty-warriors-origins-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a>, and some of the most spectacular combat to date make Origins a strong entry. If you’re wondering how much action there is, let’s check out every chapter in Dynasty Warriors Origins and how long the game is.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dynasty-warriors-origins-chapters-are-there">How Many Dynasty Warriors Origins Chapters Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lead and conquer. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five Chapters for each of Dynasty Warriors Origins’ campaigns. </strong></p>



<p>The chapters themselves aren’t named, the dev choosing to stick to generic numbers instead. <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw_origins/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins</a>‘ longevity comes from multiple playthroughs required to see and complete every mission. This is because you eventually come to a crossroads in the main campaign.</p>



<p><strong>Two of the five chapters are shared across the three campaigns</strong>, and you’re forced to <strong>choose your side in Chapter 3</strong>—leaving certain stones untouched until another journey through the conquest.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Many Missions in Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 70 main story missions and 48 side missions in total if you replay Dynasty Warriors Origins multiple times and take sides with different factions at the point of no return.</strong></p>



<p>This is where we get to see a true test of your mettle. It’s a lot of content and requires many hours, but doing so is your best way of seeing all Origins has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Long is Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>Your initial Dynasty Warriors Origins playthrough should take around 20-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll likely wander off the beaten path because of how much side content there is. But based on Omega Force’s comments, and the consensus around Origins, this is a solid figure for your first playthrough. However, as I’ve said, there are well over 100 missions to complete, a ton of special weapons and items to find, and powerful abilities to unlock.</p>



<p>Completionists are looking at well over <strong>100 hours of epic Dynasty Warriors Origins content to see and do!</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We are not done with our Origins guides yet: Check out if the action title has any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer or co-op content</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dramatic-success-in-dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Dramatic Success</a>.<br></p>



<p>How likely are you to go to the ends of the Earth to see every piece of Dynasty Warriors Origins content? Is there anything missing you hope is either added in an update?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-map-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered.1088523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is enormous. It boasts an open-world environment that players can explore at their desired pace, and it’s packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. From a massive medieval city to crumbling ruins, and from picturesque hamlets to bandit camps, you’ll never run out of things to uncover in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Fans of the series <strong>know </strong>it’s a sizeable game, but how big is the map in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-map-s">Map(s)</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts with players exploring a region called ‘Trosky’. Like in 2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance, this is a faithful recreation of a real-world territory, and the towns scattered around the starter map all exist.</p>



<p>Trosky is fairly big, and it incorporates forest regions, a large central castle, winding rivers and hills, and a scattering of smaller villages, mills, and towns. The largest town on the map is Troskowitz, which is where you’ll find most of your traders.</p>



<p>To give you an impression of how big Trosky is in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, I had logged 35 hours in the game before I felt ‘ready’ to move on, satisfied that I’d done everything possible…</p>



<p>… And then I came back to the region later to find more objectives and locations to trawl through.</p>



<p>To learn more about that journey, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/">my full preview of the game</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map-size-huge">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Map Size = Huge</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <strong>really </strong>opens up when players get to the Kuttenberg region. Again, this real-world location is perfectly represented in KCD2, and every town that you visit <strong>exists </strong>in Czechia.</p>



<p>The Kuttenberg region is staggering in size and is made up of more than a dozen towns and villages. The heart of this region is Kuttenberg, a sprawling city that plays host to some of the game’s most major sequences and missions. At first blush, you’ll be blown away by Kuttenberg – it’s an imposing medieval city with branching alleys, dozens of stores and taverns, and many people to meet.</p>



<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map is ‘fogged’ by default, requiring players to travel to actively uncover the map. This means that you’re constantly finding new locations and villages, up until the point where you’ve found everything – and even then, it doesn’t end.</p>



<p>I feel as though you’ll always bump into another NPC with a tip on a hidden location or a point of interest.</p>



<p>If you’re an explorer, you’re in luck – the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map (or maps, if you’d prefer) is enormous.</p>



<p>Before you leave, check out my guide that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/">explains more about the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story</a>.</p>

		<p>Heart Machine certainly know how to make an artistically satisfying game. The first game in the Hyper Light series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/08/hyper-light-drifter-special-edition-review/">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, blended neon colours, gorgeous pixel art and tight action gameplay to create something that immediately stood out from the rest of the indie pack.&nbsp;They followed that up with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/07/solar-ash-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Solar Ash</a>, taking their penchant for awe-inspiring, idiosyncratic visuals and moving them to 3D. Once again, this showcased the strength of their world-building and action-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker then, bears the heavy weight of expectation. As it launches into Early Access, fans of the series will no doubt delight in the world that’s been built here, but there’s a number of things that fundamentally need to change before it reaches full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClJaGZI-P78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hyper Light Breaker is an open-world, procedurally generated Roguelite. As the genre dictates, that means there’s slow, incremental progress, starting off with next to nothing, making multiple runs into the game’s open world, and building up your character’s arsenal and abilities so that the next run will go just that little bit smoother. Hopefully, you’ll make it just that little bit farther.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that this is the gameplay style of choice right now: it’s rewarding, it’s challenging, and it can create longevity without needing an extensive narrative to drive it. Hyper Light Breaker takes the basic form of a Roguelite, but then layers its own quirks and design decisions on top, some of which work, and some of which don’t.</p>


<p>The first design decision is that Hyper Light Breaker is hard. Some of the difficulty seems to be because the team at Heart Machine expect, or perhaps hope, that you’re going to play in co-op with your friends. Damage and armour don’t scale here, and you can split enemies’ attention, so, when you factor in a couple of extra pairs of hands, it becomes wholly more approachable.</p>
<p>Co-op definitely lifts the whole experience – doesn’t it always? – but it also serves to highlight that the beautiful world that’s been built here feels a little lifeless. There’s no Indigenous wildlife that doesn’t want to kill you, no sounds of nature, and for all of the visual splendour it’s not carried by the life within it. Even the excellent synthwave soundtrack drops out too much, leaving you to drift far too often in an aurally and visually frozen piece of artwork.</p>
<p>So Hyper Light Breaker is populated by vicious and utterly lethal things. The enemies here, slimes, clawed demi-humans or giant ogres, are all, without fail, tough as nails, and, when you’re starting out at least, they offer more than just a challenge, they offer a sense of unfairness.&nbsp;I spawned into one map in a zone that always had enemies in it and time and time again they caught me out, whittling a third of my health away before I’d even really begun. A big part of that is that the visibility of incoming enemies can be difficult to parse at times, and the enemy units can be so fast they’re practically a blur.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the combat isn’t good. On a fundamental level, the swift dodging, attacking and parrying feels really good, and can look visually spectacular when you factor in the different skills that open up for you. However, when you’re losing health from a bad guy you’ve barely even had time to see, it robs the game of both balance and fun. That’s compounded by some weaponry lacking impact, and a woeful lack of ammo for your ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Things do progress, and they do improve, but in Early Access you currently have to wade through some seriously testing moments before you get to them.</p>

<p>All of the game’s combat action takes place out in The Overgrowth. Each run sees you collecting Prisms, equipment and upgrades before attempting to take down three Crowns – three challenging area bosses – and then going after the Abyss King. The character designs are a massive highlight, especially for the boss creatures, and I really just wanted the chance to look at them, rather than immediately having my body crushed into a million tiny bits.</p>
<p>Some of your upgrades are permanent, and some of the items you collect will stay with you from run to run, though Heart Machine have added in weapon durability that sees many of your items disappear after a couple of runs. What that means is that progress is glacial in comparison to other Roguelites out there.</p>
<p>Your central hub, The Cursed Outpost, stands as a place of rest and respite, as well as playing host to your upgrade trees and different merchants whose wares might help you last a little longer. These need unlocking and coaxing into giving you the best stuff, and you upgrade them with the same consumables you use to upgrade your character. It creates a dissonance between the two, and further feels as though the game is unnecessarily trying to extend your time with it.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, Hyper Light Breaker is still rather moreish. A sick fascination with dying might be required for entry right now, but the world is incredible, the action sharp and varied, and it really comes alive in co-op. I hope that Heart Machine have the time and commitment to pour into it, as a few tweaks to the formula could utterly change the way it feels, and remove some of the current frustrations it seems so ready to dole out.</p>

			<p>Phantom Blade Zero, the exceedingly promising Soulslike game in development at Chinese studio S-GAME, has been shown again today with a gorgeous new gameplay trailer dedicated to the Year of the Snake celebration. The footage, which demonstrates the visual improvements that have been made since the last build, shows a new boss fight against the so-called Seven Judgements.</p>
<p>According to S-GAME, these foes will fight in a sword formation, with one of them coordinating the entire formation. The Seven Judgements were once righteous warriors who used this formation to slay countless powerful enemies but have since become puppets corrupted due to the bloodlust caused by the Transcension process. Six of them wear white robes with a dark hollow in the place of their faces, while their leader, Decree, wears blue with a similar hollow face, faintly glowing.</p>
<p>Players will have to deal with multiple enemies simultaneously while looking for opportunities to attack Decree, the heart of the formation, to complete the first stage of this Phantom Blade Zero boss fight. However, things are rather complicated due to several mechanics. For example, whenever Decree takes damage, the others sacrifice their own health to heal him. Moreover, if there are less than three disciples left, Decree will use his health to revive them. The collective health pool of all these enemies remains the same, meaning that the player must reduce them in one way or another. S-GAME says these Disciples are controlled by a group AI and can launch multi-directional attacks.</p>
<p>After the first phase, three Disciples climb onto platforms and use red strings to manipulate a puppet called Tyrannical Decree to attack the player. In this phase, enemies have a wide range of movement and swing across the arena with pendulum-like movements guided by the red strings.&nbsp; Their attack patterns are completely different from the previous phase and will require precise timing for counterattacks. Chasing them recklessly is not advised, as it can disrupt your rhythm and result in ineffective attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogm8X8SSyxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new Phantom Blade Zero gameplay trailer, S-GAME also introduced new snake-themed weapons. White Python and Red Viper are a pair of swords of different lengths shown in the first phase. The White Python is a long sword with wide, sweeping attacks, while the Red Viper is a short sword designed for precision strikes. The two swords can also be used in combination, such as the long sword propelling the short sword to attack. The Venomous Softblade, shown in the second phase, is a flexible sword that excels at countering and deflecting attacks.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is currently in development for PC and PlayStation 5. For our impressions on the previous build, check out Francesco's <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview</a>.</p>

            <p>"Your grace, the act of assigning blame is often as satisfying as resolving the issue itself," opens brilliant little browser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://sheepolution.itch.io/vox-regis">Vox Regis</a> by Sheepolution. From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The goal is Survive for five years (minutes) using as few speeches as possible, while stopping any faction growing to 30 members, at which point they'll give you the ol' rusty-pitchy-forky-bowelly, a famously terrible fate worth avoiding. As you watch from above, you'll see neutrals bumble through the town gates and eventually join factions. It's actually very fun just to watch them, but obviously you'll get forked up if you don't act.</p>
<p>I notice the frog faction getting too populous first, so I blame them for bandit attacks. Soon, their surplus members are but red stains, as tiny and insignificant as a speckled fart from the death throes of a ketchup bottle. It's actually quite intensive, too. I keep switching tabs to write notes and end up dying each time. The limited speech goal makes it, I think: you're always flittering around between the factions, doing little bits of math to work out where your rabble-rousing proclamations will be most effectively target. Also, just a brilliantly clever use of the first person - as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molleindustria.org">‪Paolo Pedercini</a>‬, who brought this one to my attention. Enjoy!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Each year, the Game Developers Conference (GDC) release the results of their State Of The Game Industry Survey, which collects responses from over 3000 developers. The 13th annual survey - which you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pel5295n7j0on8zscomjh/AJPBdLSZVQYicWY6GHf1EyY?dl=0&amp;e=1&amp;preview=2025+GDC+State+of+the+Game+Industry+report.pdf&amp;rlkey=tr7vkhg7o0gqrib3odacggjpy&amp;st=5h2e5e2l">find in full here</a> - queries respondents on topics including layoffs, generative AI, the live service boom, and funding. As is the nature of our times, it's a big grim salad with a few bright crouton sprinklings. From the report's introduction, which does not mention croutons even once:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>It feels like the last 12 months have seen their share of fortune and heartbreak. Industry layoffs have continued, to the point where one in 10 developers say they’ve lost their jobs in the past year. More studios adopt Generative AI, even though it’s increasingly unpopular among developers. Working hours are going up, investment opportunities are shrinking, and recent severe weather events… are drawing attention to the growing impact of climate disasters.</p>
<p>But the game industry is resilient, as are its developers. PC development has skyrocketed, more studios are prioritizing game accessibility, unionization support holds steady, and Hollywood continues to see the value in adapting games for the big (and small) screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's rare to see a week pass where we don't hear about job losses in some form, but even so, that one in ten figure hits especially hard. Narrative roles were hit worst at 19%, compared to 6% working in business and finance. The most common reasons given were restructuring, declining revenue, and market shifts/industry trends. In last year's survey, 53% of respondents had not been impacted by layoffs, either personally or at the company they worked for. This year that number fell to 43%.</p>
<p>19% of developers told GDC that they were given "no reason" for layoffs at their company. "If you lost your job, have you been able to find a new one?" asked the survey for an 'in your words" section, which collects direct quotes from respondents. "The games industry is killing me," was one developer's reply. Otherwise, the survey doesn't contexualise these layoffs against figures of new hires in the same period, although there's possibly a throughline here between the 56% of developers that say they’ve invested money into their own games versus the 28% who have "publishing deals and project-based funding". </p><p>This climate of layoff fatigue is paired with a growing apathy towards generative AI tools, often touted as the industry's future. "Game development is supposed to be art and an expression of one’s imagination, not an AI-generated concept with no real thought process," reads the quote from a respondent that leads the section on Generative AI tools. A majority of developers (52%) surveyed said they worked at a company that uses such tools. 16% of respondents said their company has a policy against using generative AI tools, compared to 9% where their use was mandated.</p>
<p>Almost a third of respondents felt Gen AI was having a negative effect on the industry: 30%, up from 20% last year. 13% felt the impact was positive, down from 21%. "When asked to cite their specific concerns, developers pointed to intellectual property theft, energy consumption, the quality of AI-generated content, potential biases, and regulatory issues," reads the survey.</p>
<p>"When asked what applications they saw for the use of Generative AI in the game industry, developers pointed to tasks like coding assistance, concept art and 3D model generation, and automation of repetitive tasks (developers made similar suggestions in our 2024 survey)," reads the report. "But the word used most frequently in their responses was 'none'."</p>
<p>I should acknowledge that the rhetorical device they've used at the end there - paired with the above opening quote - is obviously very skewed on one side of the argument. Then again, it's also the side of the argument I'm on, and is therefore good. Objectivity is for little weenies.</p><p>There are a few positives thankfully, as the report highlights up top. "71% of developers think their company’s DEI and accessibility efforts have been at least slightly successful, while 51% feel the same way about their company’s sustainability efforts". Additionally, union support has remained consistent from last year, with 58% of respondents in favour - a figure that may go up, given that this was the first year since the survey began that the number of developers working 40 hours or less per week decreased.</p>
<p>PC development is also looking healthy, with 80% of developers surveyed currently making games for our lovely thinking tellies, up from 66% last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
