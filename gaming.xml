            <p>Rogue Flight is an arcade space combat game with some StarFox somewhere in its DNA, "inspired by the landmark style of '80s and '90s prestige anime", also known as "the only good anime." It's due for release later this year and there's an announcement trailer below.

<p>What the trailer shows mirrors what the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784620/ROGUE_FLIGHT/">Steam page</a> says. You can perform acrobatic moves in your ship while blasting at enemies across nine stages. There's a branching narrative path and an unlockable roguelite mode if you want to add - I presume - some permadeath to proceedings. You can customise your spacecraft and pilot somewhat.
</p>
<p>Much of the marketing is focused on the voice cast, whihc features Japanese actors known for their work on Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gundam, Naruto and One Piece. Not to offer commenters even more bait, but these voices won't mean anything to me because I'm a dubs not subs guy. I watch anime on a second screen while playing video games, thus prohibiting the reading of subs. (The English voice cast features people from Fallout 76, Overwatch and League Of Legends, which may mean something to me but frankly who cares.)
</p>
<p>Spinny, flashy, rock music space combat is fun, I like it, but my interest here is mostly the aesthetic and tone. For as much as anime annoys me when it's about screaming and fan service, it delights me when it's about sad, doomed people and their awful horrible very bad mechs or space ships. Who does not dream of externalising their melancholy as a horrifying weapon we are cursed to pilot? That's already how I feel about my flesh body, but the anime robots and spaceships have much cooler control panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mojang want to release smaller updates more frequently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>, instead of one major update each summer. This evening's Minecraft Live stream <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">detailed the Bravery And Bundles update</a>, coming next, but also another update to follow in the next few months. A creepy update.
</p>
<p>It doesn't have a name yet, but it'll add The Pale Garden, a new biome of eerie, grey trees and hanging moss that's quiet during the day, but which at night is inhabited by a new mob, the Creaking.

<p>The Creaking are tree-like mobs that blend into their new biome home, making them easy to miss among the trees. If you do spot them and attack them, they don't take any damage. Instead, a ray of embers will point you towards a block in the canopy of trees, called the Creaking Heart. The heart is puppeteering the Creaking, and it's this you must destroy in order to defeat them. The problem is that the Creaking themselves move towards you whenever you look away. 
</p>
<p>If you chop down the trees in the Pale Garden, you'll get a new pale wood set you can use for crafting, and the new hanging moss can likewise be transferred or used for a creeping carpet. That's nice, but I'm mostly interested in the horror potential of a mob that evokes the Doctor Who's <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Weeping_Angel">weeping angels</a>. The Warden, a hulking mob that emerges from the ground when you make too much noise in a deep dark biome, is terrifying and produces some of the best moments in Minecraft, so more of that is a good thing.
</p>
<p>The Creaking and Pale Garden are coming to Minecraft's various beta builds soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>'s yearly showcase stream took place this evening. As part of the show, Mojang showed off some of the future updates coming to the game. First up: the Bundles Of Bravery update, which will add a proper hardcore mode to Bedrock Edition, as well as bundles, which will allow you to carry more items in your inventory when out adventuring.

<p>Hardcore mode adds permadeath to Minecraft, giving you just one life to live and automatically generating a new world when you inevitably succumb to a creeper. This hardcore option has existed in Minecraft's Java Edition for a long time, but in Bedrock you either needed to manually delete and generate a new world each time you died, or bodge it with an unsatisfactory paid mod from Bedrock's marketplace. 
</p>
<p>Bundles Of Bravery adds a simple toggle you can add when generating your world, which seems to exist independently from other difficulty settings. My kid - who watches Minecraft hardcore mode videos on YouTube all day long - will be thrilled.
</p>
<p>Bundles are pretty straightforward: a craftable bag you can place items inside which then takes only one inventory slot. Mojang say that ye olde Minecraft used to have fewer types of block, so a mining expedition would fill less of your inventory because your dirt and cobblestone would stack in your inventory. Bundles let you recreate something similar by taking all your Andesite and Diorite and Calcite and stuffing them in a bag. 
</p>
<p>These bags have been available in Java and Bedrock's preview builds <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/bundles-are-making-a-comeback">since August</a>, but they were also previously tested and scrapped all the way back in 2020. This time it looks like they'll make it through.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Bundles Of Bravery, but Mojang <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafts-new-faster-update-schedule-will-probably-fill-modders-with-both-despair-and-nostalgia">recently announced their intent to release fewer, smaller Minecraft updates</a> from now on. This one should be along soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new clip of the curious live-action Minecraft movie is here.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Minecraft Live, the clip is less than a minute long but expands on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">very first peek at the live-action movie</a> we had earlier this month.</p>

<p>The clip depicts Steve (Jack Black) showing off exactly how his crafting table works.</p>
<p>Whilst the sword Black crafts looks pretty cool to me, Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Jason Momoa) seeks to make something even more impressive… to less successful results.</p> <div>

<p>We also got to see our first Bee in the live-action movie, which is too cute not to share, quite frankly.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival," reads the official blurb.</p> <div>

<p>"Four misfits - Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) - find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.</p>
<p>"To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is currently set to make its debut in theatres next year on 4th April. For more on how the film was made, including its set design, head to 30:21 in the embedded video above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developer Spiders says it has heard your early access feedback and is addressing "two important subjects": "combat and character customisation".</p>
<p>Addressing players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/4684396507130263735">Steam</a>, the Greedfall team said the early access launch earlier this week had been "exciting", but acknowledged improvements were needed, including improving the drop rate, adjusting AI behaviours, and making dialogue scenes "less blurry".</p>

<p>After thanking players for taking the time to get in touch, Spiders said it had reviewed their feedback and questions, some of which will be addressed in an upcoming patch.</p>
<p>"We read all your feedback and questions, so we wanted to take the time to go over them with you and tell you what our team is currently working on for the next patch, as well as give you a rundown on two important subjects: combat and character customisation," the team said.</p>
<p>"With your feedback, we noted some bugs that we aim to fix soon with a small patch that should also include improvements such as: increasing certain drop rate, decreasing the DOF (depth of field) during dialogue scenes to make it less blurry, making the feedback of targeting an ally's portrait more visible, and adjusting the AI behaviour so that you do not have to spend too much time micromanaging your companions when you do not want to - making your experience in combat easier."</p>
<p>The Steam blog also delves into combat, "an aspect of Early Access that [Spiders is] particularly interested in".</p>
<p>"With the introduction of the new tactical pause system, your feedback is and will be crucial for us to ensure that the new system is fun for everyone," the statement adds, confirming that auto attacks and picking, in particular, will be improved.</p>
<p>"We are aware that some elements are still a work in progress and need improvement, and that some bugs can hinder your experience for the moment. We noted your feedback on that subject, and we aim to improve it in future updates throughout Early Access."</p>
<p>Character creation is also "another element of the game which is still in development".</p>
<p>"I worry about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall-2">GreedFall 2</a>," Bertie wrote in his fantastic feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-mystifies-me-its-currently-a-step-backwards-for-the-series">GreedFall 2 mystifies me: it's currently a step backwards for the series</a>.</p>
<p>"I've been playing the early access build that's just released on Steam and it's not great, and it confuses me, because the original game from 2019 managed to do the almost impossible: it broke into a busy RPG market and made a success of itself, despite being janky and having some problematic New World colonisation themes.</p>
<p>"But the sequel takes all of that good work and seems to step backwards from it. It's a less enjoyable game to play, it's less distinct, and the ways it has tried to evolve the series have worsened it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new Sony Corporate Report, Sony has revealed that PlayStation will use AI and machine learning to speed up its game development.</p>



<p>On page 16 of the report, Sony had that “bolstering technologies that can help creators engage in maximizing the value of their IP in efficient, high-quality ways, including sensing and capturing as well as real-time 3D processing, AI, and machine learning,” and that these technologies will help to deliver its IP “rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans.”</p>



<p>The report reveals that PlayStation used machine learning in the production of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 by applying voice-recognition software in certain languages. This process allowed the company to automatically synchronize subtitles with each character’s lines to “significantly shortening the subtitling process.”</p>



<p>Sony also revealed that it is building its Volumetric Capture Studio, which generates 3D data from people and locations to render high-quality images. They said, “Going forward, we plan to apply high-quality 3D assets, including motion data from our Studio, accumulated by each of our companies cross-functionally across the Group, and explore potential external sales.”</p>



<p>They continued, “In real-time 3D processing, we are pursuing exploratory activities with Epic Games, focused on the Unreal Engine, developed as a physics engine for game CG generation. For instance, we reused 3DCG components from a music video shot using virtual production to produce a game set in the same world and released a proof-of-concept CG-based short film using the Unreal Engine.”</p>



<p>AI and machine learning have been a hot topic in the industry in recent years around plagiarism, creativity, and the cause of reduntencies and with PlayStation getting more on board with its possibilities, those conversations are surely set to continue.</p>



<p>What do you think of companies using machine learning and AI to make games faster and cheaper? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>You may not expect the system requirements for a game’s expansion to vary wildly, but it does happen. It’s better to step into such content fully prepared, and to that end, we have a complete overview of the Starfield Shattered Space system requirements. The most significant change is, of course, the increased storage space requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-shattered-space-pc-system-requirements">Shattered Space PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>You’ll find that the system requirements for Shattered Space mimic those of the base game, which is to be expected. Bethesda wouldn’t risk increasing the PC requirements for an expansion, as it would potentially alienate current and prospective players significantly. Overall, Starfield and Shattered Space aren’t the most demanding of experiences, but if you want to max out graphical settings, you’ll need a semi-powerful system.</p>

<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that XDefiant has fallen behind expectations amid company struggles.</p>



<div><p>This week, the news that XDefiant is struggling went somewhat under the radar following what is arguably one of Ubisoft’s most challenging periods in recent memory. <span>First, it was announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is to be delayed until early 2025</a>, followed by several announcements at the company as a whole, including </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Ubisoft’s board launching an investigation into the co</span>mpany’s struggles</a>. </p><p>As part of these major announcements, Ubisoft held a <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ukxeqgsh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trading Call Update</a>, during which Guillemot answered questions about why the company had reduced its second-quarter revenue expectations by 30%. Nicholas Langlet of BNP Paribas asked, “So the Q2 guidance, is it only Star Wars Outlaws, or is there something else underperforming in the portfolio?”</p></div>



<p>Guillemot replied, “It mostly reflects the softer-than-expected sales for&nbsp;Star Wars Outlaws. We also had behind expectations for&nbsp;XDefiant, which we will give you a bit more detail at the end of October.” He continued, “To a much lesser extent, with a limited impact was a lower expectation for XDefiant.”</p>



<p>Guillemot’s comments are a stark difference from the company’s first-quarter sales report, where he reported that the game was “off to an encouraging start as we continue to grow the audience at a steady pace and plan a quarterly roadmap of content that will allow us to firmly establish the game over time.”</p>



<p>Last month, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant was at risk of losing its much-needed post-launch support</a> if it couldn’t be turned around by the end of Season 3, as the game has been struggling to see 20,000 concurrent players and an uptick in player spending. The report and subsequent community conversations led to XDefiant saying that the game “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is absolutely not dying</a>“, in a recent blog post. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game fell below 200,000 DAU (Daily Active Users in 24 hours) throughout August but saw a 40% daily average uptick in DAU throughout its daily rewards program. While good on paper, player spending and continuous player engagement are the answers to prevent the game from going on life support. At the time of writing, XDefiant leadership still hopes that Season 3 will be the start of bringing players and their wallets back.</p>



<p>A silver lining for XDefiant, though, is a push to Steam. While I’ve not been told the game will come to the platform for definite yet, Ubisoft’s recent announcement that its games will be coming to Steam on Day 1 has understandably reignited the team to push for it internally. So, fingers crossed, XDefiant will make its way to Steam soon.</p>

<p>Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev, often referred to as ‘the GOAT of CS’, has signed a three-month loan contract with Team Falcons, the Saudi Arabian organisation. This return to the competitive scene comes after a year-long absence, and it was announced by Team Falcons posting an image of Kostyliev on social media… Clutching a GOAT.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-to-ever-do-it">The Greatest to Ever Do It</h2>



<p>From the end of November until the middle of December, the Perfect World Shanghai Major will unravel in the Counter-Strike 2 scene. It’s one of the biggest events in the CS2 calendar, boasting a massive $1.25 million prize pool. That’ll be s1mple’s return to glory (hopefully), but this time around, he’ll be flying the Team Falcons banner after being loaned out by Natus Vincere.</p>



<p>On social media, s1mple wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Time to be back at LAN; that’s was my goal from the very beginning – to play the Shanghai Major! I’m very glad that we will have official games before we fix the mistakes and play the main tournament of this year!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Almost a year ago, s1mple stated that he wouldn’t be playing Counter-Strike 2 because of a need to ‘take care of people in his life’ and ‘fix documents’, and that was all he had to say on the matter. He made it clear that he didn’t have the best time with Counter-Strike 2 since it was released over a year ago, and that was likely a leading factor contributing to his lack of active competition.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though. It’s not that long before we’ll see s1mple back on the stage, right where he belongs. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>He’s one of the most storied and iconic pro players in Counter-Strike history, and with such a devoted following, he’ll have a vocal backing when he takes to the stage, even if he is flying the flag of Team Falcons, a somewhat controversial organisation that has risen in recent months thanks to the Esports World Cup.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-bethesda-irresponsible-large-worlds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-reveals-why-bethesda%E2%80%99s-games-are-%E2%80%98irresponsibly-large%E2%80%99.995379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-bethesda-irresponsible-large-worlds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Everyone loves a Bethesda Game Studios RPG. From Fallout to Starfield to The Elder Scrolls, Bethesda’s success in the RPG space has often come from the sheer expanse of these games and how many hours can be poured into exploring them. For some, the games are so massive that they’re <strong>daunting</strong>, or in Todd Howard’s words – ‘irresponsible’.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Howard explained <strong>why </strong>Bethesda’s games are just so enormous.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-bigger-better">Does Bigger = Better?</h2>



<p>Over the years, Bethesda Game Studios’ titles have gotten more ambitious and larger in scope and size. In 2011, Skyrim was released, giving players a massive, open map to explore over hundreds of hours of play. In 2015, Fallout 4, which was the biggest game in the post-apocalyptic series at the time, turned heads worldwide, becoming the franchise’s best-selling title.</p>



<p>In 2023, the team released Starfield after many years of development, offering up a veritable feast of exploration featuring 1000 planets in a vast universe.</p>



<p>Many have argued that bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better, and as Todd Howard recognises, making these worlds so gargantuan isn’t always sensible:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We cut very little from our games at Bethesda, which is why the games are so irresponsibly large. And it really comes to the whole team, you know, putting a lot of creativity into the game. It’s obviously not just me, and I think that’s what really makes them special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a team effort, and the ethos at Bethesda Game Studios is apparently to just <strong>leave everything in</strong>. While we know that plenty was cut from the likes of Fallout 4, the firm doesn’t like trimming the fat, and in many cases, anything left out will just be added later anyway.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview with BAFTA that unearthed these comments from Todd Howard:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="How Todd Howard and the Bethesda team create the massive worlds in Starfield and Skyrim | BAFTA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1l54t9VcTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Starfield might have been phenomenally huge, but BGS had issues filling that space. One of the leading criticisms about the game is how ‘rinse-and-repeat’ many of the game’s points of interest felt, with many caves and complexes featuring enemies in the same spots, loot in the same crates, and so on.</p>



<p>It’s widely expected that both The Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5 will be the biggest iterations of their respective franchises – but will bigger necessarily mean that they’re better?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/max-caulfield-double-exposure-new-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure has a new trailer that premiered today at the Tokyo Game Show. It offers a two-minute insight into the game’s story, which will see players return to the character of Max Caulfield (voiced by Hannah Telle) almost a decade after she was last on our screens.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-life-is-still-strange">Life is (Still) Strange</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure brings Max Caulfield back to the series almost ten years after the first game was released. Things have unravelled since the events unfolded in Arcadia Bay, and now Max finds herself settling down at university after ‘years on the road’. She’s in tight with many new people, and better yet, she has new powers.</p>



<p>In Double Exposure, Max will be transcending our world and walking the line between two universes, using new and powerful abilities to investigate the murder of a close friend.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure -TGS2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tA_Kehn5qtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Double Exposure is being developed by Deck Nine, the creative minds that brought us Life is Strange: True Colors in 2021. Deck Nine isn’t the original creator of the Life is Strange series, but the firm did a brilliant job with True Colors, and fans have high expectations for the new game that the studio should deliver quite nicely if the trailers are anything to go by.</p>



<p>Fans are eager to step back into the universe as Max Caulfield, the iconic character who kickstarted the series all those years ago. The events that left players heartbroken at the end of the first game were relatively open-ended, and only some post-game material such as a graphic novel tidied things up a bit.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Deck Nine has received a full creative license to dive into some of the topics of the first game to tie off some loose ends.</p>

JuiceBoxx, a streamer and one of the hosts this year, has her face plastered all over the convention center.<em> Ru Paul’s Drag Race </em>superstar Trixie Mattel has a makeup space on the show floor where employees are offering beauty tips and touch-ups, and at an off-site Capcom party, several drag queens mill about, their hair nearly grazing the ceiling of the bar.

I put a few hours into the game again to test how it ran on PC, and revisiting it after a perhaps unwise rushed first playthrough two years ago has compelled me to reassess <em>Ragnarök</em>. In the early moments, before it has a chance to overload itself with too much story for one game, god, it packs a punch. Specifically, it has an incredible, succinct early boss fight that captures the sequel’s new stakes in brilliant fashion, fusing cinematic prestige sensibilities with a clever twist that only a game could pull off.

<p>Fans have taken to Steam's review section to share their experiences, and whilst the demo sits on a "mostly positive" user review score from around 600 reviews, some have criticised the performance.</p>
<p>"I'm a big fan of Atlus games, and this has exciting potential, but the performance of this demo leaves much to be desired," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmieramone/recommended/3130330/">said</a> one less-than-impressed player.</p>
<p>"My rig should not be struggling to reach 120 fps on a game with these specs. Hopefully it'll be addressed before release, in which case I'll happily change this review, but as of right now I cannot recommend."</p>
<p>"Just need a bit more optimisation, everything else is perfect," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199091685509/recommended/3130330/">added</a> another.</p>

<p>According to Oxford University's Internet Institute and PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, which collaborated on the study, players "consistently reported a higher mood after the first fifteen minutes of the play session compared to the start of each session".</p>
<p>Across the 162,325 "in-game mood reports" from players, the average player reported a more positive mood during play than at the start of each session.</p>
<p>This kind of change is "comparable with changes seen in other leisure activities such as reading, shopping, or listening to music".</p>
<p>"At present, short-term changes in video game players' moods are poorly understood. Gameplay research frequently relies on artificial stimuli, with games created or modified by academic researchers, typically played in a lab environment rather than a natural context. Instead, we wanted to know how real play in natural contexts might predict player mood on short timescales," said lead author, assistant professor Matti Vuorre, Tilburg University and Research Associate, Oxford Internet Institute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that <em>Balatro</em> is out on mobile, I wanted to see what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">all the fuss</a> was about. And while it’s a great game, its tutorial doesn’t do the best job of setting you up for the kind of success necessary to hook you. In my first few hours, though I was completing the objectives laid out, it felt like I was stumbling my way to success instead of achieving it through strategy. Onboarding was a bit too abrupt, focused on the barebones of how to play instead of blending that with tips on how to play <em>effectively. </em>With that in mind, here’s some useful info and tips on how to get started.</p><p><h4><strong>I was told there would be no math</strong></h4></p><p>In <em>Balatro</em>, the main gameplay loop is amassing enough poker chips to beat a set chip total called a blind. To do that, you must create the ideal poker hand that maximizes the number of chips you can earn. I think what I initially had so much trouble with was understanding how scoring worked. Numbers were flying at me, and I didn’t know what they meant or where they came from. Knowing how scoring works is <em>critical </em>to maximizing your chip-earning potential.</p><p>Each hand you play is assigned a simple math equation: </p><p><em>Total chips earned = chip value of cards x multiplier score</em>.</p><div><figcaption><em>These are the math equations assigned to every hand. Using special cards, you can modify these base equations to increase your score.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>The math equation is different for every type of poker hand, and the more powerful a hand is, the bigger the equation. You don’t have to remember hand hierarchies or their equation values — simply hitting the “Run Info” button will pull up a reference list. Now, here’s the important part: this math equation changes based on the cards you play and any modifiers you’ve earned. For example, the base equation for two pair is 20 chips x 2 multiplier score. If I play two queens and two 3s, I can figure out my score by adding the total chip value of my cards (10+10+3+3=26) to the equation’s chip value (20) and then multiplying that number by 2, equalling 92 chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>Scoring works by adding up all the chip values and all the multiplier values and then multiplying the two numbers together.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>I’m loath to admit how long it took me to understand what was going on, but once I figured it out, everything clicked. I finally <em>got</em> what it was that makes this game hard to put down. Some of these blinds require amassing thousands of chips, so the main point — and honestly the biggest fun factor — of <em>Balatro</em> is beefing up those equations and your cards as much as possible. Which brings me to the next tip.</p><p><h4><strong>Cash rules everything around me</strong></h4></p><p>I wish the game took more time to explain that, early on, money is <em>everything</em>. For each blind, you have a number of chances or hands to earn enough chips, and if you don’t like the cards in your hand, you have a number of opportunities to discard cards in hopes of getting better ones. You earn the most money by beating blinds in the least amount of hands and with the fewest discards as possible. There are other ways to earn money, too, with special cards and perks you can get. Once you unlock it, use the special deck that starts you off with an extra $10 instead of the regular $4. Look for the perk (called a “tag”) that gives you $25 for beating “boss blinds” — or harder blinds that introduce some kind of negative effect like lowering equation values while requiring you to earn abnormally high amounts of chips. Bank as much as you can, as early as you can in order to...</p><p><h4><strong>Shop till you drop</strong></h4></p><p>The amazing thing about <em>Balatro</em> is that it’s managed to effectively reproduce the thrill of opening loot boxes without needing to spend a single dime on microtransactions. At the end of every blind, you get to visit the shop where you buy cards that add to or modify your deck, vouchers that impart powerful perks like the ability to increase your hand size, or jokers that have all kinds of score-modifying abilities. Go for the jokers that increase bonuses every round based on meeting certain criteria so your scoring potential can grow exponentially. My most successful run featured a joker that added a +1 to my multiplier every time I didn’t play a face card. By the end of that run, I was scoring upwards of 10,000 chips from the weakest hands played with the cheapest cards. If you see jokers that don’t work with your strategy, don’t forget that you can spend money to reroll the shop for new ones.</p><div><figcaption><em>In the shop, you can buy cards that modify other cards or increase the value of specific hands.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>Unlike most other roguelikes that let you keep some abilities or items when you die, when you fail a run at <em>Balatro</em>, all your special cards, vouchers, perks, and cash go away. You can’t take cash with you, so spend it.</p><p>Lastly, if you want to make sure you have a good time with <em>Balatro</em>...</p><div><figcaption><em>Even </em>Balatro<em>’s developer knows this game is a problem.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p><h4><strong>Install an app blocker (seriously)</strong></h4></p><p>Runs in <em>Balatro</em> are short and seamless, making it trivial to get into a groove even after having to start over after a failed attempt. And if you’re an adult with responsibilities, that’s going to be a problem — especially on mobile. Three hours in real time feels like only 20 minutes, making <em>Balatro</em> the closest human beings have gotten to legitimate time travel. After wrapping up my first day with the game sometime around 5AM without feeling the slightest bit tired, I added it to my app blocker, setting it to cut off access every day at midnight. Those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255304/bye-forever-because-balatro-is-out-now-on-mobile">jokes about <em>Balatro</em></a> <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/141549/balatro-mobile-impressions">being a productivity problem</a> aren’t that far off the mark, so if you want to try to get some sleep or work done, put guardrails in place so you can.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, adapting a game like The Last of Us Part II is a bit different from adapting its predecessor, not just because it has a more complicated, fractured narrative, but also because it’s a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review"><u>phenomenal</u></a>) game with much more dramatic meat to explore, both in terms of sheer length and in the thornier dimensions it mines from its characters. To make a show that stands up to its inspiration, it most likely will have to make some major deviations from the source material. While diehard fans may cry foul, it might be the only way this adaptation can feel as vital as the game does.</p><p>It’s something co-showrunner Neil Druckmann, who is also creative director of The Last of Us games, agrees on. Talking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the adaptation process, he noted that a common mistake is “staying so close to the source material that is built and designed and written for this other medium that has strengths and weaknesses, and trying to translate it as is, with no changes to this other medium that has different strengths and weaknesses.” Looking at the newly released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-debut-trailer-shows-joel-and-ellie-5-years-after-the-events-of-season-1"><u>first trailer</u></a> for Season 2, we can already see the first signs of how Druckmann and his creative partner Craig Mazin may have altered the original story to suit the television medium.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Max (@StreamOnMax) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1839319097273889280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2><strong>Different Mediums, Different Priorities</strong></h2><p>With so many artistic mediums bleeding into each other these days, it can sometimes be hard to remember that video games and television are two very different things. Every medium for telling stories has pros and cons that are virtually inseparable from the form. The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction in regards to scene geography, atmosphere, environmental design, and use of player expression often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p></div><p>That’s not to say you can’t try. The first season of The Last of Us meticulously rebuilt many moments from the game’s cutscenes, sometimes literally frame by frame. But what purpose does that really serve? The story worked excellently the first time around, the game is available in its best ever form with The Last of Us Part I Remastered, and the cutscenes are readily available on YouTube. If people want a truly faithful version of the story, it’s already out there and has been for years. If anything, taking this cutscene cloning approach, rather than allowing the show’s direction and cinematography to present the story’s most critical moments in a wholly new way, only highlights the ways the original games frequently veered away from the strengths of interactive narrative. And it’s developer Naughty Dog’s adoption of non-interactive storytelling technique that makes such scenes so easy to plop directly into a TV show.</p><p>I say this as a massive fan of both games: they kind of already were HBO shows. They do use the possibilities of interactive storytelling to their advantage, but in terms of basic construction and scene direction, even during playable segments, there’s liberal use of the techniques and stylistic conventions of prestige television. This is why it isn’t just ironic that the games were eventually adapted as an HBO show; it was so easy <em>to </em>adapt them because the games did a lot of the work already. This is not to discount any of the contributions from the show’s directors, writers or performers, but the blueprint for a successful television show was already baked straight into the game. So if the next season wants to be its best self, it would do well to find a new way to present the story many of us already know.</p><h2><strong>Expand and Explore</strong></h2><p>Even with its fealty to the original game, the first season of The Last of Us often benefited from the deviations it did make. Hiring Latino actor Pedro Pascal gave a strong new take for main protagonist Joel by adding a softer dad-like quality to him compared to Troy Baker’s gruffer edge, adding new characters like Melanie Lynskey’s Kathleen expanded the post-apocalyptic world explored in the original game, and devoting an entire episode to the unseen story of Bill (Nick Offerman) and his lover Frank (Murray Bartlett) led to what many considered to be the season’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-review"><u>best entry.</u></a> Unlike a video game, which usually necessitates some kind of consistency to the player perspective through the controllable character, television affords the opportunity to shift focus more readily, and the show made great use of that in key areas.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><p>The second season should use that technique to greater effect. One of the main structural conceits of Part II is playing through the same three days from both Ellie and Abby’s perspectives. Their separate paths don’t really cross over until the end of the three days, both of them going through intensely personal journeys of revenge and rebirth respectively, meaning that each lead character is essentially gone from the narrative for somewhere around ten solid hours apiece. This makes sense in a video game because jumping back and forth between protagonists each level would be jarring for a player, never allowing them to truly settle into the peaks and valleys of power and equipment a survival action game is supposed to foster. But do we really want to watch four or five episodes in a row without Ellie or Abby showing up?</p><p>Intercutting between their journeys and finding ways to draw thematic parallels between Ellie and Abby even when they’re not in the same physical space would help maintain emotional continuity and viewer investment in both characters. After all, the entire point of the extended lead-up to their confrontation is that it’s a battle we don’t want either side to “win,” because we’ve come to empathize with their experiences. It’s hard for an audience at home to go through that if a character is absent for several weeks of television. We also know that Season 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-says-hbo-series-should-be-around-for-a-while-beyond-season-2"><u>won’t adapt the entirety</u></a> of Part II, which gives the creators plenty of breathing room to add or expand on characters, subplots and world-building concepts that could give the series a fresh feel. If the trailer is anything to go by, we may have already seen hints of the show going in this direction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Trust the Process</strong></h2><p>It’s a small detail, but the teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup: it looks like Abby will spend time in Jackson with Joel and Ellie. After we see Abby’s first encounter with Joel and Tommy where they save her from infected trying to get at her through a chain link fence (a scene ripped straight from the game), we later see a shot of the three of them fleeing on horses before what appears to be a horde of infected slamming themselves against Jackson’s perimeter wall. There’s also an earlier shot of a large group of infected being spotted through binoculars as they run through snow, indicating that they are heading towards Jackson, the only area in the game where snow is featured. This all suggests that there could be a sequence where Abby and Joel get back to Jackson and have more interaction than they do in the game (perhaps even involving Ellie) before Abby kills Joel. Such a sequence would be a prime opportunity for more character drama, as well as also giving us more scenes with Pascal before he’s relegated to flashbacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup.</p></div><p>Abby ingratiating herself within Jackson’s community (a story thread concept art for the second game confirms the developers considered) and perhaps even casting her as an ally who helps them overcome an infected attack would provide us more context and inner conflict, giving the scene where she finally reveals her true motives a greater sense of dramatic weight. We get little time with Abby before she kills Joel in the game, which is a shocking scene in its original form, but viewers at home might feel a little lost if someone they assume to be one of the series’ two leads is killed so abruptly in the first couple of episodes. Getting us into Abby’s headspace earlier so we know exactly what she’s planning and why is the sort of shift that would help smooth that plot development over. And let’s be real here, more Kaitlyn Dever is never a bad thing (Did you see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollywood-please-release-your-horror-movies-in-theaters-not-on-streaming"><u>No One Will Save You</u></a>? She was very good in that).</p><p>Ultimately, we don’t know exactly how The Last of Us Season 2 will pan out, but based on the first season, it’s fair to say the creative team behind the show can be extended a little bit of trust. There’s a murderer’s row of talent involved in the production, and although a game series as beloved as this can engender strong protective feelings from its fans, it can be rewarding to let an adaptation of a story you already know surprise you. The game isn’t going anywhere. The story will always exist in that form. So let’s have a little faith and see what the differences in the new season will add to the story, instead of assuming they’ll only subtract.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.
