            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-4-charity-mod-alzheimers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>charity mod has been released, and it features the voice talents of an actor who's practically legendary if you've played Bethesda's RPGs.</p>
<p><em>Shady Motives&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adds a brand new quest</a> to&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em>, and its lead voice actor is none other than Wes Johnson, who provided the voice for iconic characters like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>'s Lucien Lachance and Sheogorath, as well as&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>'s Fawkes.</p>
<p>The mod was created in just one weekend, with community members coming together as part of Johnson's <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/wes-johnsons-voiceapalooza/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voiceapalooza charity event</a> in order to vote on what should be included. Once the mod's elements had been decided on, modders then came together for a weekend to create it.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new gear, including weapons and armor, so you won't walk away from your adventure empty-handed.</p>
<p>The mod is, of course, free to download on PC and Xbox, but if you want, you can <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/a76d5bcd-6fb8-4b78-9acf-fdd1baf1e657/details" rel="noopener" target="_blank">donate to the Alzheimer's Association</a> from the mod's page, with a default donation of $10 being set up for you (which can be changed) if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>So far, Johnson and the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>charity team&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>For Hope have <a href="https://tiltify.com/+wes-johnsons-alzheimers-association-fundraiser/wes-johnsonfallout-for-hope-to-end-alzheimers-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raised almost $35,000</a> for the Alzheimer's Association, and earlier this week,&nbsp;the official&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>For Hope X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/FalloutForHope/status/1799532680633012429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that it has raised more than $100,000 in total for the charity.</p>

Tomorrow, he'll be <a href="https://x.com/WesJohnsonVoice/status/1801007006351839649" rel="noopener" target="_blank">teaming up</a> with fellow&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>voice actors like Jon Gentry and Courtenay Taylor for a&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>-themed Q&amp;A, which will take place at 5pm Eastern (that's 2pm Pacific).</p>
<p>At a time when the industry is looking pretty gloomy and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">layoffs are becoming endemic</a>, it's nice to see charity initiatives like this and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-pride-shirt"><em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>LGBTQ+-supporting shirt</a>.

  <p id="GBYG3w">The tempestuous region of <strong>Crumbling Farum Azula</strong> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a><em> </em>is marked by its floating platforms and ancient buildings, where you must face ferocious beastmen and mighty ancient dragons. The area is also an essential component for seeing one of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24159181/endings-all-frenzied-flame-undo-one-playthrough">endings</a>.</p>
<p id="lWaXcN">In this <em>Elden Ring</em> guide, you find a thorough <strong>walkthrough of Crumbling Farum Azula</strong>, detailing the locations of items and enemies locations as well as where you find the arena to fight <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24172283/maliketh-boss-fight-how-to-beat">Maliketh, the Black Blade</a>.</p>

<hr id="O29SeB">

<p id="huzPNw">The Crumbling Farum Azula area of <em>Elden Ring</em> consists of multiple segments. In brief, you’ll need to navigate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li id="YOpWK6">Reach Crumbling Farum Azula</li>
<li id="mXN0e7">Navigate the Crumbling Beast Grave Depths</li>
<li id="ZwAFV3">Explore the Temple-Facing Balcony and surrounding environs</li>
<li id="aTcK6B">Reach the Dragon Temple Altar</li>
<li id="RgXj5c">Take the Dragon Temple Lift</li>
<li id="3pXvAB">Follow the corridor through the Dragon Temple Altar</li>
<li id="RZTMwn">Make your way to the Dragon Temple Rooftop</li>
<li id="XiLMyq">Head beside the Great Bridge</li>
<li id="E8vOzf">Reach and defeat Maliketh, the Black Blade</li>
</ol>
<p id="NIkdEH">Below, we break down every step in detail.</p>
<hr id="V4X0Va">
<h2 id="1qmrPW"><strong>Crumbling Farum Azula location and how to access</strong></h2>
<p id="WJaNDp">The Crumbling Farum Azula is a late-game region that you can only access<strong> after having defeated the </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23142817/fire-giant-boss-strategy-summon-mountaintops"><strong>Fire Giant</strong></a><strong> at Flame Peak</strong> and going through a short dialogue with Milena.</p>
<p id="6zlLgd">(You technically pay a visit to this dungeon through one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23037719/four-belfries-imbued-sword-key-waygates-farum-azula-nokron-eternal-city-chapel-of-anticipation">Three Belfries</a> portals, but that’s to a side area and not full access as outlined in this guide.)</p>
<p id="djORmL">Once you awake after the cutscene with Milena, you will find yourself in Crumbling Farum Azula.</p>

<p id="qwmc5N">At the end of the path, you’ll find a body with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950495/smithing-stone-locations-map-west-limgrave-liurnia-crystal-tunnel"><strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong></a>. There isn’t a straight path to move forward, so jump over the edge on the right side and jump your way to the entrance a little below. On your way, find a <strong>Golden Rune [9]</strong> on the last platform.</p>
<p id="m5L05I">Keep following the only available path through a short corridor and descending some stairs. You eventually arrive in a room with five beastmen.  While most of them won’t pay attention to you, one patrols the area. You can lure it to the path you came from, so you don’t have to face all of them at the same time. </p>

<p id="zlnFGT">Beastmen are the most common enemy type in the region. While there are some variations that cast magic or throw boomerang-like weapons at you, most are capable of fast slashing sequences of attacks that can kill you pretty quickly. On the other hand, they are quite squishy, so the best strategy is to approach them from behind and quickly kill them.</p>
<p id="oor3eb">Once the room is clear, don’t forget to grab the <strong>Old Fang</strong> from a corpse.</p>
<p id="sEFKc2">Proceed to the next room where you find two beastmen and a <strong>Lightningproof Dried Liver</strong> on the right side of the room. Now, before you go ahead in the next corridor, turn left to find the <strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Site of Grace</strong> in Farum Azula where you should rest a bit.</p>

<p id="KgU9wG">Go back to the corridor and down the stairs to arrive at an opening area facing the tornado.  Along the way, you will find a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong>, <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> and a<strong> Dragonwound Grease</strong> at the edge. You need to reach the furthest side of it, but, as soon as you get to the middle of the way, an <strong>Ancient Dragon</strong> lands in front of you.</p>
<p id="IngUj3">This is a tough enemy that not only attacks you with massive limbs but with powerful magic. Since defeating this enemy is not obligatory, you can just run past it toward an entrance on the left side that leads you to a corpse with a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> and the <strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Depths Site of Grace</strong>.</p>

<p id="tSOgBW">On the other hand, in case you feel like you’re ready to face the dragon — and you’ll end up finding more than one in Farum Azula — here are some tips.</p>
<p id="wug5D8">First, they are strong against elemental damage and considerably resistant against physical damage. Staying below the dragon is the most safe strategy since it helps you avoid most of its attacks. While focusing on the hind legs makes it easier to avoid frontal moves, the ancient dragon has other attacks that can still hit you. Luckily, you can summon your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ashes</a> to help you.</p>
<hr id="TT2qX8">
<h2 id="VWcbwc"><strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Depths</strong></h2>
<p id="lcuNIp">Leave the room with the site of grace and move forward to the next room to find a <strong>Smithing Stone [7]</strong>, one patrolling beastmen, and another one lying on the ground. Proceed after dealing with the enemies by entering the corridor that will take you to the lower floor or use the window on the left side to access the upper floor by climbing the roof. We advise you to take the latter first.</p>

<h3 id="lhfAl6"><strong>Through the window </strong></h3>
<p id="1IK5Mu">Get on the ledge of the large window and follow it to climb the roof right beside it. From there, access the upper floor. This room has two big openings on the floor that give access to the lower floor. Although you want to go there after grabbing all the loot in this room, beware of them so you don’t fall before you’re prepared.</p>

<p id="vNGptf">There are six beastmen in this room. Watch out for their magic. After killing them, get the <strong>Gravel Stone</strong> on the left side of the room, a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong> near to the edge of one of the openings, and a <strong>Great Grave Glovewort</strong> at the farthest side of the room. </p>
<h3 id="Mga8Fl"><strong>Down the corridor </strong></h3>
<p id="qdytw1">You can get to the lower floor using the short corridor in the room after the site of grace or via the second opening on the upper floor, from where you can jump to a bridge with two beastmen. We suggest starting from the initial room and following the corridor. </p>
<p id="wXIAC3">Once you leave the corridor, you’ll find some stairs that will take you to the lower part. Going right and following the corridors will take you to that bridge you saw from the upper floor, where you’ll have to fight a few beastmen. Going straight and descending the stairs will lead to 14x Lightning Greatbolts and get to the lower area.</p>
<p id="nDHfBe">The lower area is a large chamber with four beastmen, an <strong>Ancient Dragon Prayerbook</strong>, and three exits.</p>
<ul>
<li id="Orq7y6">The northwest exit leads to a body with a <strong>Golden Rune [12].</strong>
</li>
<li id="vnrUAR">The northeast exit leads you outside to the <strong>Tempest-Facing Balcony Site of Grace</strong>.</li>
<li id="824VSU">The southwest exit leads you to an elevator and a body hidden on the right side with a <strong>Hero’s Rune [2]</strong>.</li>

<p id="D4lvtY">After leaving the elevator, you can go right or left. While the former takes you to an arena where there’s a Smithing Stone [8] — and a fight with an Ancient Dragon — the latter leads you to an area filled with Lesser Wormfaces, enemies that can afflict you with Blight, which kills you instantaneously if the bar is filled.  </p>

<p id="xlg9jd">By following the left route, going south, keep close to the wall to avoid the enemies. Eventually, you get to a small lake with three Lesser Wormfaces, a <strong>Rejuvenating Boluses</strong> in the middle of it, and a gazebo on the farthest side of the area.</p>

<p id="iIYpfG">Jump to the lower area and keep going north. This area is filled with skeletons which you can simply ignore – but if you’re fighting them, don’t forget to hit them after they dismantle. There is a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [7] </strong>on a platform ahead of you, and a <strong>Golden Rune [9]</strong> on the left side of this area, behind some pillars. </p>

<p id="0QGWsn">There are two corridors on the left for you to explore, some stairs to descend, and a skeleton waiting to ambush you. </p>
<h3 id="VAMQJZ"><strong>Focusing on the main objective</strong></h3>
<p id="sEHRzb">In case you just want to progress through this area as quickly as possible, then you should take the first route. It’s a corridor that takes you to a balcony where you can sneak attack another skeleton and find a path on the left. Following it will take you to another platform with a ladder. Climb it, defeat the skeleton at the top of it, and look northeast to find another corridor where there is a <strong>Great Grave Glovewort</strong> But, grabbing the item triggers an ambush and three skeletons come from the ceiling. After defeating them, you should go back, stick to the wall on your left, and jump on the lower platforms.</p>
<p id="EFIcEl">You will get to a corridor where there’s a patrolling skeleton and <strong>3x Gravel Stones</strong> at the end of it. You can now leave the corridor and you will be back to the segment before jumping in the hole. Take a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [9]</strong> that is near the end of the corridor, and make your way to the <strong>Dragon Temple Site of Grace</strong> right in front of you. </p>

<p id="EZIoqk">When it comes to the path on the right, first you go through a corridor where there is a patrolling Banished Knight. Kill it and get to the next room where you will find two Banished Knights and the <strong>Azula Beastman Ashes</strong>. If you leave the room using the door on the west side, there is a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [9]</strong> to grab. On the opposite side of the room, you get to the <strong>Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace</strong>, which is just beside the boss arena.</p>

<h3 id="9OncU1"><strong>Back on track</strong></h3>
<p id="N8Y0YA">From the <strong>Dragon Temple grace,</strong> in the next corridor, there’s a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong> and stairs that take you to a new section from where you start facing Banished Knights. Around Farum Azula, you find three types of these enemies, each with unique abilities: Dual Blades, Lancers, and Sword &amp; Shield. They are pretty tough foes, who can use skills similar to weapons arts, so try to face one at a time. </p>

<p id="2dPtGH">Once you descend the stairs, turn right. There are two paths for you to go here. First, go left, and enter a corridor with another Banished Knight. Up ahead, a second Banished Knight is standing still close to a body with a <strong>Stone Key</strong>. By entering the room next door, prepare to face a third Banished Knight in a short dead-end corridor where you can grab 2x <strong>Dragonwound Grease</strong>.</p>

<p id="LujEhO">With all the loot collected, you should go back and take the stairs in the corridor instead of turning left. At the bottom of the stairs, there is a patrolling Banished Knight and another one in a room to your left. You won’t find items there, so you can simply ignore them and enter the room of the first boss encounter in Crumbling Farum Azula, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23143025/godskin-duo-boss-strategy-apostle-noble-crumbling-farum-azula">Godskin Duo</a>.</p>
<p id="DRmPyY">Defeating them will unlock the <strong>Dragon Temple Altar Site of Grace</strong>.</p>
<hr id="rjLjMy">
<h2 id="RuGy0A"><strong>Dragon Temple Altar</strong></h2>
<p id="IVBxPZ">With the first boss encounter finished you can follow three different paths. On the south side of the room, you’ll find the <strong>Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace</strong>. The northwest entrance takes you to a room with a Banished Knight and a body with a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong>. Explore both places before heading north.</p>
<p id="4IOvKQ">From this exit, you get to what seems to have been a room that now has no ceiling and only a part of the floor where you are at. To keep moving on, you need to access the lower floor. You can jump to the lower level or descend the stairs to your right. In either case, two beastmen await for you there. Defeat them and go to the next room with a dog and a <strong>Golden Rune [11]</strong>. </p>

<p id="hRhkOK">In the next segment, you’re still walking around the remains of buildings and rooms. To proceed, you need to use the windows on the left. There are two dogs and one beastman in this area. Near them, an <strong>Old Fang</strong>. Before you go ahead, when you’re facing the next corridor, instead turn left and follow the tight ledge to find a <strong>Hero’s Rune [5]</strong>.</p>

<p id="Nug915">If you take the stairs at the end of the corridor, you will access the upper part of this building, where there are some beastmen, a pillar on the left side that helps you reach another platform with a beastmen and an <strong>Ancient Dragon Scale Smithing Stone</strong>; and by going straight ahead, to your left, you find a Stonesword Key door.</p>
<p id="lCK93g">In case you have one of these items with you, we advise using it to get to an elevator that takes you to the <strong>Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace</strong>, which gives you access to a whole new area that you may want to explore before moving on.</p>

<p id="ufgQ5M">You eventually arrive at the other side of the building. Take the stairs to get to the upper part and go east to find a skeleton near to <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong>. Come back and go west, where you find a <strong>Golden Seed</strong> and a <strong>Rune Arc</strong>. If you follow the path on the left, you go down to an arena with a sleeping Ancient Dragon. In front of them, there’s a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong>. Keep in mind that you don’t have to fight the dragon but they will leave if you get too far from the arena.</p>

<p id="sCqMyU">By going straight up ahead from where you got the Golden Seed, you can walk over two structures to reach the other side. Move on until you get to another sleeping Ancient Dragon. This one is way too tired to fight you if not attacked. Walk around it to find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> at their back and a walkway to the next platform. Go toward the southeast to find a <strong>Smithing Stone [7]</strong>. To get to the next platform, you need to use the walkway behind the large structure at the southwest of the platform. Once there, you need to jump onto a bridge a little bit lower to move on. </p>

<p id="7Wk6Cg">In this new area, there is an old building where you find the <strong>Ancient Dragon Apostle’s Cookbook [4]</strong>. But be careful! There’s a skeleton just waiting to ambush you on the right side of the building. From the left side of the building, you can jump to grab a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [8]</strong> from a body on the edge. Below where you are, there is another platform with a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong>. With that, we finish exploring the area from the lift. Teleport back to the Dragon’s Temple Lift grace, use the elevator and descend the stairs we took in the last section. It’s time to follow the corridor</p>

<p id="JjfCdm">Once you leave the short corridor, ahead of you, there is a sequence of debris that you must use to platform your way to the next building. By getting to the second platform, you can get pretty close to the edge to fall to a platform where you find the <strong>Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +2</strong> right below it. This is the most safe strategy since it’s difficult to land in the correct place by jumping.  On the right side, before the last platform, you also find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong>. </p>
<p id="0IObo7">The next building splits into three paths. To the left, there are two beastmen, which you can ignore. Go right, and follow the stairs to the upper floor, where you find a spell-casting beastmen, a dog, and a <strong>Dappled Cured Meat</strong>. Get back to the lower floor and head to the north path that takes you to an arena where you must face a <strong>Crucible Knight</strong>. At the beginning of the battle, they only use their sword and shield to attack you. However, after losing some HP, they will start using a flying attack and breathe fire at you.</p>
<p id="eM8H67">Although beating them is not mandatory, you will have a hard time trying to escape. Whether you defeat it or are capable of running, you want to jump on the platform on the north side of the arena — where you also find a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> — and make your way to the next site of grace.</p>

<p id="jduv3c">From where you are, it’s possible to see an Ancient Dragon on the south side of the area. Once they see you, the dragon will start casting magic attacks at you. Since exploring the area — which is filled with Warhawkes — is difficult while trying to avoid the dragon’s attacks, the best strategy is to run straight to where they are and right up until the point marked on the map below. After you’ve done that, they will fly away leaving the area a little bit less dangerous to you. </p>

<p id="uHZIQJ">With the dragon out of the way, it’s time to properly explore and collect the loot. First, there is a <strong>Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</strong> in a gazebo behind where the dragon was. In the middle of the arena, you find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> and a <strong>Fulgurbloom</strong>. Now, instead of going back using the bridge you came from, go northeast, and jump on the rooftop of a building to reach a higher area. Besides some warhawkes trying to kill you, this area has a <strong>Golden Seed</strong> and a <strong>Smithing Stone [7].</strong></p>

<p id="YfHSeC">The next step is to go southwest to where we ran from the dragon and keep going right. You need to fight a couple of beastmen as you go a little bit further. When you arrive at a collapsed tower that serves as a walkway that you need to traverse to progress, you need to be extremely careful. There is a beastmen on the other side throwing boomerangs at you which can easily make you fall. When it comes to actually crossing over, start on the right side then move to the left.</p>

<p id="3PulME">Go ahead and enter the building. Defeat the three beastmen inside and grab the <strong>Somberstone Miner’s Bell Bearing [5]</strong>. By taking the door on the right side, you get to the stairs that will take you to an elevator and, consequently, to the <strong>Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace</strong>. We advise doing so to save your progress. However, go back to the previous building in case you want to explore a new area and perform a quick time travel. If not, move on to the Besides the Great Bridge section of this guide.</p>

<p id="mItxgU">When you get to the major platform, go to the sand-like place without the skeleton present in the others and the option to “Lie Down” will pop up. By doing so, a cutscene will play and you will get to the arena of a secret boss, the mighty <strong>Dragonlord Placidusax</strong>. You don’t have to defeat it to finish the game, so it’s up to you whether you want to face this challenge or not.</p>
<hr id="TOf3IG">
<h2 id="ERJe0y"><strong>Beside the Great Bridge</strong></h2>
<p id="y7WKwG">This is the final area in Farum Azula. By leaving the grace room, go up the stairs to get to a large bridge. First, head north and enter the building following the single available path. The door takes you to an outside area with lots of bodies of beastmen on the ground. Among them, there are some alive that are just sleeping. A good way of spotting them is by pressing the targeting command. </p>

<p id="LO71JM">Back to the bridge, on the south side of it, you find the boss arena where you need to face Maliketh, the Black Blade. On the way to the gate, you will find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> and a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [7]</strong>. In front of the gate to the arena, there is a Draconic Tree Sentinel. While their move set is similar to the one you fought to enter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell</a>, this one is weaker. You can, however, simply ignore it and enter the arena. On the other hand, once you kill it, they don’t respawn, and drop the <strong>Malformed Dragon </strong>armor set. </p>

While everyone else was glued to the raid race, enjoying the wild 12-player final mission it unlocked, and has been deep in the post-game grind ever since, I’m still barely past the half-way point in the main campaign and, I gotta be honest, it was a slog up to that point. In terms of story and presentation, <em>The Final Shape</em> is everything I’ve hoped for so far, but those early missions had nothing on <em>The Witch Queen</em>. </p><p>Fortunately, literally everyone else I’ve asked has said the back-half of <em>The Final Shape</em> is its strongest, and a genuinely bold display of the game’s ambitions firing on all cylinders. It’s been a while since <em>Destiny 2</em> sucked me in like a live service black hole, but I can’t wait to experience some of that again this weekend. In fact, I’m almost glad I missed out on the initial wave of everyone completing the expansion, because now I can experience the campaign in my own time, without the anxiety of the power grind or keeping up with the rest of the <em>Destiny 2 </em>community zeitgeist. I’ve been spoiled enough to know there’s an<em> Avengers</em>-style showdown coming and I can’t wait. After all, it’s one I’ve waited 10 years for. — Ethan Gach  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-recommend-id="image://6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-recommend-id="image://6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Enjoy some more Remedy weirdness</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake II</em></a></span> was my favorite game of last year.

It’s a collection of three non-canon self-contained stories about side characters from the base game. What that means in practice is that developer Remedy is having more fun than ever, as the studio can handwave away any wild things they get up to in the DLC as not part of the canon. There is a story about the Alan-obsessed waitress we see in the base game, a meta-story about actor Shawn Ashmore playing a fictionalized version of himself, and even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span><em> </em>crossover starring Jesse Faden.

But that kinda makes it a bit easier to try out more than a few to see if they’re worth becoming essential, go-to ways to play this big space game. </p><p>Slowly but surely, I’m starting to believe that the game I wanted out of <em>Starfield</em> is within my grasp. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4256aad9ba5a8e0e9e9f8e03ca479d2d" data-recommend-id="image://4256aad9ba5a8e0e9e9f8e03ca479d2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers dressed in medieval-style armor walk through castle ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers dressed in medieval-style armor walk through castle ruins." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bioware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4256aad9ba5a8e0e9e9f8e03ca479d2d" data-recommend-id="image://4256aad9ba5a8e0e9e9f8e03ca479d2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers dressed in medieval-style armor walk through castle ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Brew all the Elfroot</p><p>Yeah, I know, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">I know</a></span>, I’m like one of those people who discovered <em>Fallout 3</em> for the first time because there was a TV show. But, for what I believe to be <em>really</em> good reasons, I never played <em>Inquisition.</em> That’s odd to me, given <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is one of my all-time favorite games. I was, in fact, the very first person in the world outside of BioWare to finish it! I spent 120 hours playing it for its world-exclusive review, and I <em>adored </em>it. I was even one of the few people who didn’t hate the second game on its release. But by the time <em>Inquisition</em> came along, things were different. It came out the year I had a kid, and boy did I no longer have time to play a 700-hour RPG. And when I looked at it, and saw it didn’t even vaguely resemble the first two games, I had no inclination to try to fit it in.</p><p>Working with people at <em>Kotaku</em>, I’ve learned just how loved <em>Inquisition</em> truly is. First the dearly departed Ash Parrish, and now completely besotted Kenneth Shepard, has been enough to make me believe I’m missing out on something, even if the stupid game doesn’t let you zoom out far enough to satisfactorily control battles with its third-person action game delusions. So I’ve installed it on my Xbox, rather than the PC on which I would otherwise play any and all RPGs, in the hope that a controller will convince me to embrace its heresy. I’ve already closed a few green flickering portals, and plan to spend any spare moments I get over the weekend seeing what’s what. I’ll admit, in a sneaky 10 minutes playing this morning before dropping the boy off at school, I found some Elfroot behind a building, and that suckered me in hard. —John Walker  </p><hr><p> And that wraps our picks for this weekend.

<p>Final Fantasy 14’s Dawntrail expansion is scheduled to arrive on July 2, 2024. Ahead of the release, we have just received a brand new launch trailer for the DLC. This trailer gives players a glimpse of the new journey that the Warriors of the Light will be setting sail towards, along with a showcase of some gameplay elements. Check out the launch trailer for Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BghYTigv8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail expansion will transport us to the uncharted region of Tural, nestled in the western continent. This is a new setting and a gateway to a thrilling adventure, the birthplace of the fabled ‘legend of the golden city’. As the rite of succession looms, your involvement as a player will be pivotal in shaping the future ruler of the nation of Tuliyollal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Additionally, players will have new jobs up for grabs, such as Viper and Pictomancer. Vipers are agile, close-ranged combatants that excel in quick, precise strikes. They wield two one-handed blades, allowing them to unleash a flurry of slashes against their enemies. Vipers are particularly effective when enemies are weakened, as they can deliver the final blow. On the other hand, a Pictomancer is a unique character capable of bringing imagination to reality. This character uses a magical brush to cast different colourful spells against the enemies, creating stunning visual effects and powerful attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the FF14 Dawntrail expansion, a treasure trove of new content awaits. Embark on thrilling Raids like Echoes of Vana’diel, The Arcadion, and Futures Rewritten (Ultimate). Traverse through a myriad of new dungeons, engage in field operations, and conquer challenging trials. The horizon of adventure has expanded.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Furthermore, the system has received an all-new graphics update, including many visual improvements, enhanced texture and shadow resolution, and improved material qualities for characters and environments. The Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail expansion introduces a new playable race, the Female Hrothgar. This race, known for their strength and resilience, brings a unique aesthetic to the game. Moreover, you can now create a truly unique character with the new set of customization options introduced with the DLC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Madden 25 Features Revealed By EA Sports]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-features-revealed/</link>

<p>A day after its originally planned reveal, EA Sports has announced the first set of features coming to Madden when it releases on August 16.</p>



<p>This year’s game will include a number of changes, both big and small, to multiple aspects of the game. From gameplay to presentation to game modes, EA Sports has seemingly touched on a lot of different areas to improve the game for players.</p>



<p>Before getting into what was announced, it should be noted that this isn’t everything coming to Madden 25. The full reveal is currently scheduled for Tuesday, June 18. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-madden-25">What’s New In Madden 25?</h2>



<p>Moving on to what was announced. Starting with gameplay, EA Sports confirmed it’s new BOOM Tech technology on the field. According to EA, BOOM Tech is “new physics system that calculates player ratings and skill-based timing to deliver 1-on-1 ball carrier impacts for more authentic physical outcomes”. Accompanying that on the field is a new ball-carrier balance system that will allow players to combine jukes, spins, and hesi-steps in “branching animations” as well as new ways to break tackles and recover your balance based on ratings.</p>



<p>Also coming to the on-field action are new and updated playbooks and audibles for more variety of plays. One example used by EA is the “Miami Motion” plays that had been created for wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The last thing announced regarding gameplay is that Madden 25 will feature “more control at every position”. </p>



<p>“From the trenches to the sidelines, core gameplay gets increased control across key areas including innovated passing, catching, blocking, and coverages,” EA said. </p>



<p>Speaking of passing, it appears the passing meter debuting in College Football 25 will be making it’s way to Madden 25 based on the short gameplay clip shown. Another gameplay feature coming to Madden from College Football is the new defensive switch stick control that allows players to flick the right stick to control different players post snap.</p>



<p>When it comes to the game’s presentation, EA confirmed an Insider Gaming report that there are two more commentary teams coming to the game this year. Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen will make up one of the new teams while Kate Scott and Brock Huard will be the other new team. Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis are also expected to return.</p>



<p>Within Franchise Mode, another Insider Gaming report was confirmed as the NFL Draft will receive an overhaul within the mode. EA also promises more depth and immersion within the mode as a whole with more details to be revealed later.</p>



<p>Madden 25 will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Keep in mind that certain gameplay features are only available on current-gen consoles and PC.</p>

But this year's game is going to be more than that. We recently spent a day at EA Orlando (formerly Tiburon) to check out Madden 25 in advance of its launch this August and came back with 25 things the Madden community should know before they strap on their shoulder pads for Madden 25.</p><h2>Boom Tech</h2><p dir="ltr">In the third year of EA's "Fieldsense" experiment--that being the team's slow and steady rebuild of Madden's core on-field gameplay and mechanics--it's Boom Tech that's taking center stage. Though Boom Tech is the type of juicy marketable term EA always builds into a game launch, the underlying gameplay changes were apparent in my hands-on time with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">So what is it? Boom Tech is Madden 25's overhauled physics and collision system--basically a more momentum-, size-, and skill-driven system that resolves the ever-present football question: What happens when this guy runs into that guy? Play after play, game after game, Boom Tech is meant to result in more realistic, varied, and thus unpredictable tackle animations.</p><p dir="ltr">The team said it's heard from players that Madden being driven by canned animations is a legacy frustration, and though Boom Tech is not bringing a freeform, ragdoll-like effect, what it does do is break tackles into several split-second animations that can be chained in different ways in different moments, which, if tuned well, should mean both more visual variety as well as a heightened emphasis on players' measurable size and skills.</p><p dir="ltr">In some examples I saw, a ball carrier was run over by a charging defender with the momentum advantage, clipped on the side by the defender who partially whiffed on the hit, and lastly, spun out of the tackle. In each case, the game film was broken down like the Zapruder film to exhibit how numbers are being crunched under the hood, so to speak, and in an instant that doesn't disrupt the game, but rather brings a more authentic experience to the tackling mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Truth be told, it is a tricky mechanic to explain. I don't envy the person who has to say all this in a single sentence for the back-of-the-box description. I think when you get your hands on Madden 25, you'll feel the difference too.</p><h2>Enhanced rushing attack</h2><p dir="ltr">Along with the enhanced tackling mechanics, there is a greater focus on the running game. Running backs will now have more situational awareness, as seen in the way they "get skinny" as they run through a lane in the trenches. The juke move has been re-tuned so that not everyone can execute it well. It'll be more skill-based in Madden 25 after developers noticed that seemingly even pedestrian RBs could get away with an ankle-breaking juke.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, for players who deserve to have killer skill moves, they'll have more directional control, including moves being performed at angles of 90, 135, or 180 degrees. New hesitation moves will also be unleashed. All of these new skill moves can be chained together in ways that are meant to create a higher skill ceiling for the best Madden players on the sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">Ballcarriers, be they running backs or even defenders who nabbed a turnover, will now protect the ball better, bringing it into their bread basket rather than running with it dangerously out in the open. And because of Boom Tech's buff to defenders, all these new ballcarrier moves are meant as the counter. Now, using moves like these will help you get a defender out of position, creating more missed tackles or, at least, falls forward when the Boom Tech math works out in your favor.</p><h2>Hit stick update</h2><p>The above changes culminate in the new Hit Stick update in Madden 25. Simply put, it will be more skill-based going forward. Hit-Sticking someone on the shoulder as they run by you is going to be less of a blow than centering on their gut as they move vertically down the field, for example. By giving defenders and ballcarriers more fluid control, something as ingrained in Madden as 2004's Hit Stick will suddenly feel different and more controllable. This essentially rewards defenders or ballcarriers for properly lining up or skillfully evading the Hit Stick, respectively.</p><h2>Signature player locomotion</h2><p dir="ltr">Some guys just move differently. The NBA 2K series has expressed this well for years now with player crossovers and jumpshots that mimic their real-life counterparts every step of the way. Madden 25 is finally going to express some of that too, though it's uncertain to what extent.</p><p dir="ltr">Two examples I was shown include cover star Christian McCaffrey's signature stride and Isiah Pacheco's stomp-running, which has jumped off the screen since he started getting playing time with the Chiefs. Hopefully, this year and into the future, we'll see even more players with particular movement styles see themselves more authentically expressed in Madden.</p><h2>Deeper pass protection adjustments</h2><p dir="ltr">Clint Oldenburg is seen as the gameplay boss at Madden, so it's no wonder the former NFL offensive lineman continues to invest in the trenches. In Madden 25, you'll be able to call half-slide line adjustments for the first time, meaning only the left or right side of the line can be told to change their protection, rather than demanding the entire OL moves as one unit.</p><p dir="ltr">A new on-field icon, the Hot Indicator, identifies a player showing blitz, allowing players to try to account for pressure that may be coming at the snap. Of course, the defense can disguise these things by showing blitz, but ultimately backing off, or by showing blitz with a player but bringing the heat with a different player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319286" data-ratio="0.56252545824847" data-width="2455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319286"></a><figcaption>The offensive line will have more nuanced ways to adjust the play pre-snap in Madden 25.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg"></figure><h2>Branching catches</h2><p>For years now, Madden players have had three catch types: secure, aggressive, and on the run. A fourth catch type is coming to Madden 25: the spectacular catch. Yes, spec catching, as the devs and fans often call it, has been in the game, but it's no longer tied to aggressive catches, given how previously an aggressive catch <em>may or may not</em> result in a spec catch. The studio wants to eliminate that guesswork. Now, if you want to attempt a spec catch, even just to be a show-off, you can, and when you want to use an aggressive catch instead, you can do so while trusting the animation you get won't be a David Tyree-like snag.</p><h2>New pass-catching enhancements</h2><p dir="ltr">Also, you'll now be able to change your catch animation before the ball arrives. For example, if you initiate a secure catch (where you wideout will grab the ball and go to the ground) but notice you've got space to turn it upfield, you can switch to catching it on the run before the ball gets there. Think of it like how an NBA player may adjust their drive to the basket in that split-second when a shot attempt is made.</p><p dir="ltr">Benefitting the passing game are also new custom route stems. Building onto the "smart route" option, which tells a pass-catcher to perform his route's break at the first down marker specifically, you can now adjust the depths with more options, like running an out at 5, 10, or 15 yards down the field. This should give Manning-like players more ability to dissect a defense.</p><h2>New NFL kickoff rules</h2><p dir="ltr">The NFL surprised many when it announced it would adopt new kickoff rules meant to reduce the number of touchbacks starting this fall. Basically, the league wants to make kick returns happen more often without sacrificing the player safety initiatives seen as of late. The Madden team has promised these new kickoff rules will be seen in-game at launch, after a mad dash by the team to get them in the game swiftly.</p><p dir="ltr">Oldenburg said the league and the studio both expect NFL coaches to dial up some creative strategies over the next season and beyond, and as they appear in real life, the studio will work to bring those strategies into the game as well.</p><h2>Multiple commentary teams</h2><p dir="ltr">Just like College Football 25, Madden is adopting a strategy of multiple commentary teams for this year's game. The tenured pair of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis is still there, but some games will also feature booths such as Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen, as well as Kate Scott and Brock Huard.</p><p dir="ltr">The alternate teams will be used for bigger games, such as primetime matchups and playoffs, while the classic team will remain the primary commentary team.</p><h2>Better Draft presentation</h2><p>For Franchise players, the NFL Draft presentation is getting a visual overhaul, alongside some mechanical improvements, too. For one, you'll now see high draft picks walk up to the stage in their suits--no longer wearing weird Draft jerseys. Later picks will be seen getting calls from GMs in their homes. All the while, a "big board" will display all the picks in the round so far, just like you'd see during a network's presentation of the event.</p><h2>Improved Draft prospect scouting</h2><p>New sorting and player comparison tools will also limit the number of button presses and screens you'll go through in order to browse players by certain metrics, such as 40-yard dash times, and the game will <em>finally</em> let you compare Draft prospects side by side.</p><h2>Roger Goodell, but you can't boo him</h2><p>It wouldn't be the Draft without Roger Goodell announcing picks on the stage. The commissioner is coming to the series for the first time in a move that will also see him present the Lombardi Trophy to the champions at the end of each season. Sadly, despite Madden's emphasis on authenticity, the commish won't be booed, as is the norm in real life. I asked EA Orlando's Mike Mahar why this is, and he joked that he would pitch the idea to the league in his next meeting, "and I guarantee you they will boo <em>me</em>out of the room."</p><h2>Randy Moss in the Lombardi presentation</h2><p>Also new to that Super Bowl championship cutscene will be Randy Moss, not a generic player, carrying the Lombardi Trophy through the crowd of players and up to the stage. In real life, this responsibility falls to a legendary player, and the EA team wanted to give that small moment more authenticity for its game. Straight cash, homie!</p><h2>Female head coaches</h2><p>Women are only recently getting the opportunity to be in the coach's room in the NFL, but EA is staying ahead of the curve and letting you create a female head coach for the first time in the series' history.</p><h2>70 more Franchise story scenarios</h2><p>The Franchise story generator has been in the game for a few seasons now, and in Madden 25, 70 more scenarios are coming, including many that emphasize season-long arcs rather than one-and-done narrative beats. You'll also need to worry about players' personality attributes, which have been in the game seemingly without a purpose for a long time. Now, a player with a low personality attribute may be higher-maintenance and express their frustrations with you as their coach, demanding you appease them, ignore them, or perhaps ship them away to another team.</p><h2>Team Builder</h2><p>College Football is back this year, but thankfully the Team Builder website is not exclusive to the student-athlete sim. Madden players will also have the ability to build their own team logos and uniforms from scratch, share them with the community, import them into H2H or Franchise, or--if they prefer--skip all the work and just enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor by downloading some custom teams from the community downloads suite.</p><h2>Improved player progression</h2><p>The Franchise team wanted to give player progression tuning an overhaul, citing previous examples of an aging Derrick Henry getting a speed upgrade that simply did not make sense. Which 30-year-old running back is getting <em>faster</em> at that age? None, so now in Madden, things like that should stop happening. This is a feature I was only told about, so the jury is out on how well it's been implemented, but the idea makes sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716"></a><figcaption>CMC lands on the cover for this year's game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg"></figure><h2>Six-on-six MUT mode</h2><p>Moving into Madden Ultimate Team mode changes, the biggest one is a new 6v6 mode that feels more like a backyard football game. It's not as flashy as Superstar Showdown, and is instead meant to be another way for MUT players to compete with their teams, including 6v6 lineup options.</p><h2>More Superstar appearance customization options</h2><p>The Madden Superstar (formerly Face of the Franchise) customization options have been bad for a long time. This year's game thankfully addresses that, to a degree anyway, with more cosmetic options for your character's face and body, including the return of tattoos, better hair renders for beards, and new (and twice the previous amount of) starting templates to choose from.</p><h2>Renewed NFL Combine experience in Superstar</h2><p>For players in the game's career mode, the NFL Combine will hold more weight on your career arc, helping you climb the expected draft position charts and even improving your character's attributes with an impressive workout. New drills will also be used for specific positions, though some, like the bench press and 40-yard dash, will remain universal. 26 new minigames in total have been added to the game, though these drills are available beyond Superstar mode, too.</p><h2>Better player grading in Superstar</h2><p>The live player-grading system has also been tweaked to better account for additional considerations, such as rushers hitting the right hole on a play, or how well a receiver runs their route. Previously making a play was paramount, but now you'll want to better execute the play that was actually called, though freelancing into the end zone will still be beneficial to your grade.</p><h2>More storylines and team interactions in Superstar</h2><p>Superstar mode is adding quests, too--essentially long-term goals for you to chase such as branding deals, team and league records, and rivalries with other players. Teammate interactions, which have been starkly absent before, will now be more of a focus, and your play on the field can lift up those around you.</p><h2>College Football 25 Road To Glory compatibility</h2><p>Of course, the biggest change to Superstar this year is how it integrates with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">College Football 25</a>. Since your custom player is not tied up in the NIL deal that prevents wholesale roster importing from CFB to Madden, your Road To Glory player can be easily moved into Madden, giving your player more depth and history as you experience both their college career and then their journey as a pro that follows.</p><h2>New seasonal rewards for Superstar Showdown</h2><p>For players who like to take their custom athlete into the showboaty Superstar Showdown mode, a deeper seasonal rewards tree will be there to give you more things to do. Just like how MUT adds new rewards every season, Superstar Showdown will add new limited-time modes and rewards to chase as you rank up through the game's new leaderboard system.</p><h2>Classic Madden songs returning as stadium tracks</h2><p>Last on our list is music. Fans of the classic NFL Films bangers won't be treated with the return of them, but the EA team has commissioned its own new--and, I'll admit, instantly appealing--main theme that will greet players as soon as they open the game. It's quite reminiscent of the NFL Films classics of yesteryear, and I'm extremely eager to hear it again once it's available online and in-game. Also, classic Madden tracks from past eras will be coming back and heard in stadiums around the league.</p><p dir="ltr">A few bands mentioned by name were Green Day, Fall Out Boy, and Twenty-One Pilots. So though the menu tracks may be a lot of hip-hop still, the game as a whole will feature a wider spectrum of genres, including some songs that may seem nostalgic to long-time players.</p><hr><p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, though players with an EA Play subscription or who purchase the Deluxe edition or MVP Bundle which includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523761/">College Football 25</a> will be able to play the game as early as August 13.

                <p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of the most-discussed news topics in recent years. Seemingly everyone is weighing in with their thoughts on how AI might change the world--from video games and movies to politics and more. Now, the Pope has shared his thoughts during the G7 Summit in Italy.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-06/pope-g7-artifical-intelligence-objective-neutral.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vatican News</a>, the Pope said AI is a "true cognitive-industrial revolution" that he believes will lead to "complex epochal transformations."</p><p>He said AI could lead to transformations that are both good and bad. For example, AI advancements might help democratize access to knowledge and help with scientific research, the Pope said. He also noted that AI might help reduce "demanding and arduous work." At the same time, advancements to AI could lead to a "greater injustice between advanced and developing nations or between dominant and oppressed social classes," he said.</p><p>The Pope went on to say that AI is a "tool" that can make "algorithmic choices," but this lies in contrast to humans who can use wisdom derived from life experience to make decisions. As such, the Pope said important decisions in the world should always be made by humans, adding that autonomous weapons that are capable of killing with no human input should be banned.</p><p>Ultimately, the Pope said he believes political action is "urgently needed" to tackle the issues that AI presents in the world.</p><p>In the world of media and entertainment, AI was one of the issues that Hollywood unions fought for in its latest round of strikes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-hollywood-writers-got-in-their-new-contract/1100-6518026/" data-ref-id="1100-6518026">ultimately winning a variety of protections</a>. For video games, many have expressed concerns about potential negative impacts of AI, but that hasn't stopped the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-ceo-is-very-enthusiastic-about-generative-ai/1100-6523854/" data-ref-id="1100-6523854">Microsoft, EA, Take-Two, and others speaking very positively about how AI can help accelerate and improve game development. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="389" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Summer has always been a hype time for video games thanks to all the industry showcases. Summer Game Fest, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Xbox showcase</a>, and a few others highlighted some incredible titles for everyone to look forward to, but we mustn’t forget that the industry as a whole is in serious turmoil. In fact, as of this week, there have been more layoffs in the past six months than in all of 2023.</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this is according to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog by technical artist Farhan Noor</a> that tracks industry layoffs. While these are only estimated figures, the data highlights how dire things are at the moment. By the end of 2023, approximately 10,500 people working in the games industry lost their jobs. There were early signs that these cuts weren’t going to slow down in 2024 and, as of this week, an estimated 10,800 people have been let go since the beginning of the year.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">What tipped this year’s figures past the landmark was the Tencent-owned Sumo Group’s decision to reduce staff by up to 15%, meaning roughly 250 employees would’ve been affected (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-to-reduce-staff-by-up-to-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>). One of its subsidiaries, Timbre Games, was shut down entirely, as confirmed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timbre-games_there-is-no-better-group-of-people-in-games-activity-7206724903322984448-GoPR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this LinkedIn post</a>. The studio was founded only three years ago and had yet to release a single game. These layoffs also came one day after a “<a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800154801671401972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">busy weekend</a>” where Sumo Group shared new announcements for its upcoming projects during Wholesome Direct and the PC Gaming Show.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Obviously, Sumo Group shouldn’t bear all of the blame here. Many other companies are equally responsible for gutting their studios and firing staff, including the likes of Microsoft (which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamously shuttered three studios</a> and absorbed another a couple of months ago) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive</a>.</p> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="false">There are a number of factors responsible for all this, but it doesn’t change the fact that the future of the industry is looking bleaker than ever. Many people who’ve been let go may very well never work in video games again, which means a lot of lost experience. It’s reached a point where it’s become difficult to recommend anyone pursue a career in game development. All the while, company executives offer platitudes about how such layoffs are difficult but necessary decisions. That’s easy enough to say when you’re not the one out of work.</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s new update</a> has delivered an awesome assortment of tweaks, fixes, improvements, and new content that hasn’t gone unnoticed by the community. Its most important feature, though, was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the long awaited enemy patrol fix</a>, and something might’ve gotten broken along the way, from the look of things.</p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Specifically, it would appear that even though Arrowhead Games certainly did do <em>something</em> with the logic behind <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s enemy patrol spawning, it’s definitely not the way it used to be before <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-update-01-000-300-april-29-patch-notes-weapon-balance-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prior major update</a>. In fact, some players have reported that they’re now coming across even <em>more</em> enemy forces than ever before, which is about the opposite of what was supposed to happen. The issue is so pervasive, in fact, that even Arrowhead Games’ community manager has chimed in, promising to look into it further.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure>  <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="965" data-injectable="true">Here’s the kicker: <em>Helldivers 2</em> comes with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-change-the-difficulty-in-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a dozen disparate difficulty modes</a> for players to peruse at their own pace. This doesn’t mean much in practice, though, when almost every difficulty pushes each encounter into absolute overdrive just for your fireteam to stay alive. The way Arrowhead has handled this aspect of the new update is that they claim to have reverted patrol spawns back to how they worked pre-version 01.000.3000 <em>with</em> “some slight tweaks.” These “tweaks,” specifically, are supposed to make “levels less empty if [the players] are far away from important locations with enemy presence.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t seem to have worked the way it was supposed to, judging by what I’ve seen in action. Now, as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player</a>, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that the game does seem <em>somewhat</em> easier to play after the latest update: certainly <em>way</em> less over-tuned in the lower difficulties, where I usually stick around, but it’s still a fair bit more challenging than it used to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">This, too, wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if the challenge felt satisfying, but this isn’t usually the case. On the bug front, patrols are now larger and feature more small-scale enemies that will quickly overwhelm you even in the middle of nowhere. On the bot front, on the other hand, it’s impossible to eke out a safe zone the way we once could simply because a new patrol appears just over the nearest ridge. This results in a gameplay experience where there’s precious little downtime, and you’re always running out of key resources.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Whatever the case may be, Arrowhead Games will need to let the community know whether this is the intended playing experience across all of the game’s difficulties, or if the new update is bugged yet once more.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="false">It’s a bit of a bad look, too: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-patches-may-slow-down-as-arrowhead-plans-to-take-its-time-with-the-next-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Games specifically and very substantially slowed down the game’s update cadence</a> to prevent such problems from taking place. Now, we’re looking at what is either an unexpectedly messed up patrol bug, or the team is still over-tuning the difficulty across the board. Whatever the case may be, I’m hoping Arrowhead explains what’s up sooner, rather than later.</p>

<p id="fenPFB">At last, you’ve reached the Secret Medallion location. If you follow the path just a bit further, you’ll see a dark corner on your right, with a small stone tomb in front and a large tree on the left. In this dark corner, as pointed out by the arrow, there’s a <strong>large pot</strong> — this is Old Albus in disguise. Hit the pot once to <strong>reveal Old Albus</strong> and exhaust his dialogue, after which he’ll hand you the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)</strong>.</p>

<p id="YtkwJJ">To reach Castle Sol, you must cross the narrow bridge toward the north, ride through a valley until you see a massive giant ahead of you, then turn left. Keep riding until you hit a seemingly dead end, then use the wind current on your left (shown in the picture) and fly up the mountains. Cross another bridge (going north again), then ride down the snowy slopes — Castle Sol is in the lower valley.</p>

  <p id="Auq0Rv">Looking for an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> <strong>Malenia boss guide</strong>? Malenia, Blade of Miquella, Goddess of Rot, and bearer of a shard of the <em>Elden Ring</em>, is one of the toughest bosses in the game — and that’s saying something.</p>
<p id="HJ8sAe">Don’t let that discourage you though; with the right preparations and a good battle strategy, even Malenia can be defeated. Our <em>Elden Ring</em> guide will show you <strong>how to beat Malenia</strong>, including details about her location, weaknesses, and attacks.</p>

<hr id="NTApkT">

<p id="EyNyVT">Malenia resides at the bottom of the Haligtree, the relatively small region found north of the Mountaintops of the Giants. To get there, you must advance through <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22972704/liurnia-of-the-lakes-dungeon-locations-rewards">Liurnia</a>, Altus Plateau, and the eastern part of the Mountaintops of the Giants before collecting the Elden Ring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23934763">Haligtree Secret Medallions</a> and gaining access to the Consecrated Snowfield. </p>

<h2 id="NqdRWN"><strong>Things to know about Malenia</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li id="BC8vp7">
<strong>She heals with every hit.</strong> Malenia regains health every time she lands a hit on you, even if you block it. For that reason, using a shield in this fight is not advised.</li>
<li id="0a42wS">
<strong>She deals physical damage</strong> with slash and pierce attacks. During the second phase of the fight, she’ll inflict Scarlet Rot.</li>
<li id="n2b5Vk">
<strong>She has multiple one-hit-kill attacks.</strong> No matter how high you pump your vigor or how heavy your armor is, you can and will be one-shotted by several of Malenia’s attacks. You must learn to avoid them. We’ll go over them below.</li>
<li id="1oYmPe">
<strong>She does have weaknesses.</strong> Malenia is almost unbelievably strong, but she does have weaknesses. We’ll tell you exactly what to bring to this fight.</li>
<li id="euwMKN">
<strong>Summons are key.</strong> Summoning other players for this fight is a gamble. You might get lucky, or your phantom helpers might die the first time Malenia uses Waterfowl Dance, leaving Malenia with beefed-up health while you’re still fighting her solo. Using a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ash</a> is a more reliable choice. We’ll go over your best options in the guide.</li>

<hr id="5jeKBW">
<h2 id="LLHJB5"><strong>Malenia’s weakness and resistances</strong></h2>
<p id="7xzKih">Luckily, even Malenia is weak to certain damage and attack types. Here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is weak against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3gWs0H">
<strong>Frost damage</strong>. This is Malenia’s lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="M7MYjl">
<strong>Bleed damage</strong>, also known as Blood Loss. This is Malenia’s second-lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="IEfYeb">
<strong>Fire damage</strong>. While using magical spells isn’t the best strategy against Malenia (more on that below), weapons with innate fire damage work great. </li>
<li id="fk6pfe">
<strong>Physical damage</strong>. Melee attacks can work very well against Malenia.</li>
</ul>
<p id="smXzf7">To avoid using this, here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is exceptionally strong against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="5V2dDE">
<strong>Scarlet Rot damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the Scarlet Rot status effect.</li>
<li id="d3AqrV">
<strong>Poison damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the poison status effect.</li>
<li id="b0wzSh">
<strong>Holy damage</strong>. Malenia has a high Holy damage absorption. If you have a Faith build, it’s better to use fire incantations like Burn O Flame instead of Holy damage.</li>
<li id="eZ2zn7">
<strong>Most magic</strong>. Malenia will easily dodge most sorceries and incantations you can throw at her. There are exceptions, like the Night sorceries, Ranni’s Dark Moon, and Dragonice. But even then, it’s hard to find enough time to cast them. To top it off, landing spells on Malenia often triggers her most devastating attack, Waterfowl Dance.</li>
<li id="FHqIXT">
<strong>Shields</strong>. Malenia heals herself even if you block her attack with your shield, so using one puts you at a serious disadvantage.</li>
<li id="AVtOwh">
<strong>Parrying</strong>. Unfortunately, Malenia will only be staggered by every third parry, instead of every parry like a normal enemy. It’s doable, but not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<hr id="lEhrgR">
<h2 id="kyzFei"><strong>Prepare for the Malenia boss fight</strong></h2>
<p id="Isui5x">Now that you know Malenia’s strengths and weaknesses, how do you exploit them? Here’s a list of combat strategies that work well against Malenia:</p>
<ul>
<li id="xHtscI">
<strong>Use dual-wielding</strong>. Forget about shields; dual-wield two weapons of the same type instead. This allows you to power-stance, which unlocks new attacks using the L1 button. Fast weapons like katanas or twinblades are best, but greatswords like the Claymore can work if you have more strength than dexterity. Whatever you choose, make sure to upgrade both weapons as much as possible. </li>
<li id="IiyJJK">
<strong>Use a light load</strong>. Malenia is fast and you don’t have a shield, so you must rely on dodging to stay alive. A heavy load makes things difficult, a medium load is doable, but a light load of less than 30% maximum equipment makes dodging easy. Then again, this is a very risky strategy — one mistake could tilt the fight in Malenia’s favor. </li>
<li id="Kcm9KH">
<strong>Or at least not a heavy load</strong>. You can use a heavy weapon, but don’t go for a full heavy loadout as you won’t be able to dodge Malenia’s attacks. Basically, choose the most powerful armor set you have that still falls within medium load range. </li>
<li id="JL7oZt">
<strong>Build resistance against physical damage</strong>. Armor sets with high resistance against slash and pierce are always the best choice. Don’t forget to combine them with a physical damage-reducing talisman like the Dragoncrest Greatshield.</li>
<li id="1VWRLp">
<strong>Make dodging easier with Bloodhound’s Step</strong>. If the light load sounds too difficult, you may imbue your right-hand weapon with the Bloodhound’s Step Ash of War. This is a souped-up dodge that causes you to briefly turn invisible and slide around the room, totally impervious to damage. Without a doubt, it’s the single best tool to give you a slight edge against Malenia. You can get it by defeating the Night’s Cavalry mini-boss at the bridge north of Lenne’s Rise in eastern Caelid.</li>
<li id="WexPSP">
<strong>Exploit Malenia’s Frost weakness</strong>. Imbue at least one of your weapons with the Cold Affinity. Grab the <strong>Glintstone Whetblade</strong> from the courtyard of Raya Lucaria, or use Dragonice, purchased at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid (though its slow cast time leaves you vulnerable). The same goes for Ranni’s Dark Moon, which you can get by following <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982931/ranni-questline-renna-radahn-nokron-eternal-city-three-sisters">Ranni’s</a> questline and reaching the Moonlight Plateau. If you’d rather just chuck grenades at her, the recipe for Freezing Pots is in the Glintstone Craftsman’s Cookbook [6], located in a building on the east side of the main courtyard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994833/caria-manor-boss-location-level-map-dragon-sword">Caria Manor</a>.</li>
<li id="teOrHY">
<strong>Focus on causing Bleed damage</strong>. Thanks to its innate Bleed damage, Rivers of Blood is one of the best weapons against Malenia. If using a katana or another weapon with innate Bleed damage is not an option for your build, go get the <strong>Black Whetblade</strong> at Night’s Sacred Ground, a part of Nokron, Eternal City accessed by jumping down the rooftops near the Ancestral Woods site of grace (down the meteor hole that appeared after you defeat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Radahn</a>). The whetblade enables you to add Blood Affinity to most weapons that have no innate element.</li>
<li id="tpdD99">
<strong>Deal fire damage</strong>. If you have a weapon with innate Fire damage, such as the Magma Blade, that’s a great option too. You can obtain it at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013379/questline-boss-invitation-locked-door-npcs-hidden-wall-secret-wall-stonesword-key-room">Volcano Manor</a>, where it’s dropped by man-serpents. Alternatively, bring some Volcano Pots and chuck them at Malenia whenever you can. </li>
<li id="utWVjI">
<strong>Stagger Malenia.</strong> Yes, you can stagger Malenia, and it’s actually not that hard. Wait for her to finish an attack combo, then hit her immediately afterward to stagger her. </li>
<li id="CIvrLN">
<strong>Get a Scarlet Rot cure</strong>. Last but certainly not least, bring enough Preserving Boluses with you to cure Scarlet Rot in the second phase of the battle. The crafting recipe is found in Armorer’s Cookbook [6].</li>

A solid choice for dual-wielding would be the <strong>Cold Uchigatana</strong> with Bloodhound’s Step in your right hand and <strong>Rivers of Blood</strong> in your left hand. When using Bloodhound’s Step, equip the Carian Filigreed Crest talisman, which you can purchase from the blacksmith Iji when following Ranni’s quest. It reduces the FP cost of skills, allowing you to teleport-dodge more frequently. </p>
<p id="5jP9wC">The <strong>Nagakiba</strong> katana and <strong>Eleonora’s Poleblade</strong> are also great weapons against Malenia, especially since both come with Bleed damage and (in the case of the Poleblade) Fire damage. Nagakiba is obtained by completing Bloody Finger Hunter Yura’s questline or by defeating him in combat, and Eleonora’s Poleblade is obtained by defeating Eleonora, the Violet Bloody Finger, at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau</p>
<p id="yAxJqs">Don’t underestimate the <strong>Bloodhound’s Fang</strong> either, which has amazing physical damage. You can get it by defeating the Bloodhound Knight Darriwil in Limgrave. Dual-wielding this weapon is quite overpowered as it builds Bleed incredibly fast, but you can only obtain a second Bloodhound’s Fang if it’s gifted to you in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22948338/multiplayer-summon-finger-items">multiplayer</a>. If that’s not in the cards, Bloodhound’s Fang goes perfectly fine with Rivers of Blood. </p>
<p id="E912aD">If you’d rather try to stagger Malenia with a heavier weapon, the <strong>Blasphemous Blade </strong>Greatsword with its massive physical and fire damage is one of the best options. Its Taker’s Flames ability deals amazing stagger damage, knocking Malenia down if you can manage to land it without her dodging the flames. You can trade Rykard’s Remembrance for it in the Roundtable Hold. </p>
<p id="9d4TM9">If you’re looking for a way to ‘cheese’ the Malenia boss fight, the <strong>Ordovis Greatsword</strong> is your friend. This is quite surprising, especially since some of its damage is Holy, but the Ordovis Greatsword’s value lies in its <strong>Ordovis’s Vortex</strong> spinning skill (demonstrated in the picture below).</p>
<p id="gBugD8">This attack requires a short charging time, but if Malenia gets caught in it, she can’t break away and it’ll knock her down — allowing you to use it again. In other words, you must carefully wait for an opening, stun-lock Malenia in Ordovis’s Vortex, and deplete her HP. Ordovis Greatsword is dropped by the Crucible Knight in Auriza Hero’s Grave, a dungeon north of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell</a>. </p>

<h2 id="noKJdz"><strong>Best Ashes and Talismans for Malenia</strong></h2>
<p id="csDvOi">Besides <strong>Bloodhound’s Step</strong>, there are other <strong>Ashes of War</strong> that Malenia has a hard time dealing with. Rivers of Blood’s<strong> Corpse Piler</strong> can rapidly proc Bleed and staggers her somewhat reliably. You get it from the NPC invader near the Church of Repose in Mountaintop of the Giants.</p>
<p id="kXryMf">Similarly, Eleonora’s Poleblade’s<strong> Bloodblade Dance</strong> lets you do heavy Bleed and poise damage then dance away from her to avoid retaliation. It’s obtained from the NPC invasion at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24168717/yura-bloody-finger-hunter-questline-steps">Yura’s</a> questline.</p>
<p id="6qgTc7">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade"><strong>best Spirit Ashes</strong></a> to use against Malenia are <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong> or <strong>Mimic Tear</strong>. Unfortunately, tanky spirits aren’t as good as you might think because Malenia will regain health every time she hits them. Tiche, on the other hand, doesn’t have a ton of health but is excellent at dodging.</p>
<p id="FCsJ5h">She’ll distract Malenia while you unleash your attacks. You can get Tiche from the Ringleader’s Evergaol on the Moonlight Plateau (once again, part of Ranni’s quest). As long as you have a decent loadout, the Mimic Tear is always a great choice, but especially if you’re focused on building Frost and Bleed status effects. </p>
<p id="iWZp81">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23065127/every-talisman-map-location-pouch"><strong>talismans</strong></a>, the <strong>Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman</strong> is incredibly useful as it negates a lot of incoming physical damage. <strong>Erdtree’s Favor</strong> can help you increase your equipment load limit (especially handy if your favorite armor set is a tad too heavy) while also improving your HP and stamina. For those who depend on vigor, strength, dexterity, and endurance, <strong>Radagon’s Scarseal</strong> is an amazing option, but beware that it also increases incoming damage. A simple strength-boosting talisman like <strong>Starscourge Heirloom</strong> may therefore be the better choice.</p>

<h2 id="hgtiJJ"><strong>How to defeat Malenia phase 1</strong></h2>
<p id="xMuU6o">Malenia will approach you as soon as you enter the boss arena. When she’s within melee range, be prepared to dodge her first attacks. The trick to surviving is to be very patient, keep dodging, and hit whenever her combos have finished. </p>
<p id="dDkBjb">If you’re able to proc Bleed and Frost multiple times, you can burn her down before she even gets a chance to use Waterfowl Dance. Most of the time, mastering this phase is simply a matter of keeping your distance so she doesn’t catch you by surprise, managing your FP so you can always use Bloodhound’s Step to get away from Waterfowl Dance, and being smart about when you try to get in a hit or two.</p>
<p id="Ba6gel">Here’s an overview of the attacks used by Malenia in the first phase of the battle:</p>

<ul>
<li id="x7cP3P">
<strong>Idling</strong>. Malenia’s idle state during the first phase of her fight is to simply walk slowly toward you. There’s an opportunity to attack here, as it’s often safe to walk up and poke her with a single probing attack while she’s doing this. Just be ready to dodge away when she inevitably responds. You can “trigger” her idling stance if you dodge away and create a lot of distance between you and Malenia.</li>
<li id="7a51pV">
<strong>Side jump</strong>. Sometimes, when dodging or after taking a hit, Malenia will jump to the left (your left) and have a brief moment of poise break. It’s a great opportunity to land another hit, as she won’t attack immediately afterward. You can try to do a quick stab during idling and follow it up with another attack after a side jump. </li>

<ul>
<li id="HPEWb0">
<strong>Normal slashes</strong>. Malenia has a bevy of general slashing attacks using her extra-long katana. She combines these in unpredictable patterns that make them challenging to dodge. Bloodhound’s step makes it easier. In general, you want to keep a medium distance from her for most of the fight, and never try to sneak an attack in during her standard slashing combos. She will punish you almost every time.</li>
<li id="CCTqFg">
<strong>Spin kick</strong>. Malenia often opens her combos with a deadly spin kick, which can’t be blocked or parried. Thankfully, it’s slow and the windup is obvious. Since her follow-ups can be more deadly, get some distance when she kicks. Don’t try to attack after it.</li>

<ul>
<li id="SDrYsh">
<strong>Spark Combo</strong>. One of Malenia’s most common attacks is a quadruple-slash combo that’s telegraphed by a mechanical sound effect and orange spark from her prosthetic arm. Get used to recognizing this cue and get the hell out of her way when she unleashes this, which she does constantly. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can teleport backward and get out of its range. It’s more difficult to avoid with a normal dodge, so you must make sure you’re far enough away from her at all times. </li>
<li id="r3QwFX">There are two variations of that move. You can tell which version you’re getting by the fourth slash in the combo: If the fourth slash arrives quickly after the third, the combo is likely to continue. However, if there’s a slightly longer delay before the fourth slash arrives, she’s about to stop moving for a moment, providing one of your best attack opportunities in the fight.</li>

<ul><li id="KEC214">
<strong>Spark thrust</strong>. This move is predicated by the same sound effect and orange spark as the previous one, but Malenia’s stance is completely different; she hops in the air for a moment while drawing her sword back, then thrusts towards you. This is the single best attack opportunity during phase 1, as there’s a way to predict it (it often triggers when you create a bit of distance between you and Malenia) and dodge; you don’t even have to use Bloodhound’s Step. And she never follows it up with anything during this phase, so you’re always safe to get a slash or two in after she uses it.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li id="BaK28x">
<strong>Slow lunge combo</strong>. When Malenia draws her sword slowly behind her in a crouch, she’s about to lunge toward you for a two-slash combo. There are two variations of this, with slightly different timing. You’ll have to learn the difference, although Bloodhound’s Step makes it easy to dodge either one. This is another attack opportunity — she’s vulnerable after the second swing, and if you’re near her when she starts winding it up, you can even get some hits in before she lunges.</li>
<li id="jn9nuO">
<strong>Overhead jump slash</strong>. This attack is similar to the previous one, but without the long wind-up. It’s always preceded by a standard horizontal slash, and often follows the fast version of the four-slash Spark Combo. It’s another great opportunity to attack, as she’s vulnerable after landing.</li>

<strong>Lunging Grab</strong>. Malenia pulls her left hand back, crouching down slightly, and lunges at you after a short delay. Avoid this at all costs.

<strong>Waterfowl Dance</strong>. This is the big one. Once her health drops below 75%, Malenia can unleash the deadly Waterfowl Dance any time. She jumps into the air for a long pause (see picture above, make sure you recognize it!), then flies toward you, unleashing a flurry of white slashes. This will kill you if she catches you in it — and yes, it’s borderline unfair. Thankfully, it can be dodged. As soon as she rises into the air, you have to sprint or Bloodhound Step away from her as quickly as possible (this is the main reason why you can’t spend the whole fight up in the boss’s face pressuring her with attacks; if you’re right under her when she does this, it’s almost impossible to survive, even with Bloodhound’s Step). If you can catch enough distance, the first two parts of the Dance will miss you. For the third flurry, she always teleports directly to you, no matter how far away you got; you have to dodge toward her as soon as she does it. She’ll shoot past you, and you can hover just outside of her range for the fourth part, including the final spherical slash that marks the move’s conclusion. After this, she’s vulnerable to another attack — provided you survive that long. </li></ul>

<ul><li id="K68phg">
<strong>Rot Nuke</strong>. Malenia flies up into the air, orange and scarlet wings fluttering, and pauses before dive-bombing you. You can survive this by dodging at the exact right moment — try activating Bloodhound’s Step as soon as she begins moving from her floating stance. Then, if you survive the initial impact, the boss explodes again as her petals open, turning her into a huge orange flower. Stay out of range as the petals open to avoid the damage and scarlet rot build-up they cause. This is your one reliable ranged attack opportunity during the fight; you can unleash spells, incantations, and throwables while she’s recovering. You can also rush in as the petals finally dissipate to attack her briefly up close. She always opens the second phase with this attack, so it’s imperative that you learn how to dodge it.</li></ul>

<strong>Phantom clones</strong>. Malenia floats into the air and sends a series of phantom clones slashing and thrusting your way. This attack is fairly easy to recognize as Malenia will fly upward in a glowing whirlwind, but the phantoms are hard to dodge. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can simply spam L2, provided you have enough FP. She ends this attack by lunging toward you herself with a powerful sword thrust. She’s vulnerable to attacks afterward, if you’re close enough to her after dodging, though it’s a small window, since she usually starts up another combo a moment after landing.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="6Mpm4L">
<strong>Small scarlet flower</strong>. Malenia plants a small orange bloom in front of her, which explodes a moment later, causing damage and scarlet rot build-up. Sometimes she flies into the air for a moment, but not always. This is the reason why your attack opportunities from phase 1 are unreliable now. Malenia retains all the same moves and combos from before, but now, she has a roughly 50% chance to follow up any move with this ability. Any combo after which she would have previously been vulnerable, from the Spark Thrust to the Slow Lunge, can be followed by this attack instead. Luckily, she always pauses on the ground as the small flower blows up. If you can get behind her and avoid the small explosion, there’s still a window to attack here.</li></ul>
<p id="GdBvSA">In addition to those new abilities, <strong>Malenia retains all the moves from phase 1</strong>. Beware that her combos are even more unpredictable as she tends to fly up into the air more often. Since she spends so much time in the air, it’s harder to predict when Waterfowl Dance is coming. Your only safe bet is to run away anytime she flies upward and get ready to dodge whatever attack is coming. Keep your distance, be patient, wait for your attack opportunities, and keep your FP and health topped up.</p>
<p id="Dj9Aom">When defeated, Malenia drops the <strong>Remembrance of the Rot Goddess</strong>, Malenia’s <strong>Great Rune</strong>, and a whopping <strong>480,000 runes</strong> on your first playthrough. If you manage to take her down, congratulations — you’re a true Tarnished, no matter how you did it.</p>

Whether exploring cathedrals and canals in Renaissance-era Venice or colonial cities in North America during the 18th century, Ubisoft's flagship franchise has been creative with recontextualizing history. But when it comes to making an entry set in an era often explored for games, the next Assassin's Creed aims to approach it from different angles to showcase its next setting and protagonists in a new light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developer Ubisoft Quebec leans into the studio's prior experience on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AC Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to make a game with dual protagonists who can engage with the setting and its characters very differently. Focusing on the story of the African foreigner turned samurai Yasuke and the female shinobi Naoe coming into her own, they each offer a unique perspective on contending with wartime Feudal Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the Ubisoft Forward 2024 showcase,&nbsp; we spoke with associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois about how the developers leaned further into building an open world around two protagonists that are polar opposites of one another.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft Quebec has worked with dual protagonists before">Ubisoft Quebec has worked with dual protagonists before</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Lemay-Comtois, realizing the long-requested Feudal-era Japan setting was about "pushing forward with that shinobi fantasy," which aligns with the series' focus on elusive assassins in historical settings. Yet, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was imperative for the dev team to not only make an AC game with ninjas and samurai, but to deliver a well-rounded experience that centred the very different perspectives of two unique protagonists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first time helming a core AC game, and at the time, we were very ambitious with what we wanted to do," said Lemay-Comtois. "But of course, we were young and didn't go all in as we could have with that game. Now that we're a more mature studio with experience handling games like this, we trust ourselves with AC and push much further with the contrast between the dual protagonists and their experiences. One is an African male and a foreigner in a new land, and the other is a Japanese female trying to find her place during an era where women had a very different experience. So we're leaning into these real cultural tenets, pushing as far as we can in ways we couldn't on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the story takes place during the end of the Sengoku period in the 16th century, with Yasuke and Naoe–both outsiders in their own ways–joining forces to navigate the complex hierarchies of power during a civil war in Japan. There are, of course, larger and more sinister forces to contend with that lean into AC's blend of historical fiction and sci-fi fantasy. Much like Ubisoft Quebec's work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the twin protagonist approach offers two contrasting narratives that comprise a larger whole and showcase parallel gameplay styles–with Yasuke focusing on combat and fighting in the open, and Naoe relying on stealth action that has some influence from Splinter Cell's light-and-shadow gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, each character and their respective gameplay styles reflect the two core pillars of the AC series: combat and stealth. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> still retains AC's recent trend towards RPG mechanics like leveling up and earning gear, the core combat and stealth focuses more on the action and timing-oriented gameplay from earlier games. Players can choose which characters to take on specific missions and leverage their individual playstyle to overcome obstacles (and do murder) in unique ways. It's a notable change given how combat-heavy recent games in the series have become.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our demo saw the same mission being played with each character, offering a glimpse at how choosing either Yasuke or Naoe will fundamentally alter the flow and dynamics of missions. In one pivotal moment in Yasuke's mission, he tore through the walls of the lord's sanctum to access his target. Naoe, by contrast, carefully grappled onto roofs and crawled prone-style through a pond out of sight to land a stealth kill. That duality makes for a refreshing change of pace for the franchise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making feudal Japan stand out as a setting">Making feudal Japan stand out as a setting</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Ancient Japan and the mythology of the samurai and ninja have been common conceits within games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wanted to take an opportunity to shine a particular spotlight on details and figures not often represented from the era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lemay-Comtois says the historical figure of Yasuke and how he navigated Japanese society during the era was something the dev team stumbled upon during their research. This not only helped them gain a greater understanding of how to best reflect Japan's history and culture through the lens of Assasin’s Creed, it also made the developers acknowledge their own outsider's perspective while pursuing a sense of authenticity for the setting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the opportunities it gave us was to be humble about the culture of Japan, because it's not ours–we're a Canadian studio leading this game, so we know we're not of Japan, and we certainly don't want to tell Japanese audiences what their culture is all about," said Lemay-Comtois. "We want to respect the setting and era and put it forward for AC, and having Yasuke as one of the main characters with an outsider's point of view was a way for us to have some creative leeway in crafting this story from different angles. But also having Naoe as the other protagonist, who is Japanese-born and of the culture, allowed us to have that needed counterbalance for the Japanese perspective to bring it all together."</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has drawn the ire of certain online communities, which have expressed outrage at the choice of a Black protagonist in a Japanese setting. Lemay-Comtois said he and his team weren't fazed by the racist backlash, and that picking two underrepresented protagonists from Japanese history was in the spirit of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is taking an intelligent approach to building one of the series' most requested settings, while also seizing the opportunity to resolve a recurring issue that has seen modern Assassin's Creed gameplay become inconsistent with combat and stealth. Protagonists Yasuke and Naoe offer unique ways to content with and navigate the rich setting, and make for compelling additions to the long-running series.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

It does not matter if you log in through your Nintendo, Xbox, or PlayStation account. As long as you log in to your main account, this is what you’ll need for the next step.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">With this done, now click on your account on the top left of the screen. On mobile, it should be the same process. <strong>Click on Account Management and proceed.&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Here, you should find a section that says <strong>“Link Your Twitch Account”</strong> which should show you that you can get the free Broca Prominence Syandana if you do.

<p data-characters="305" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> has been parked on the horizon for what feels like an eternity. First announced <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-reveal-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2021</a>, it’s perhaps due to my excitement that a few years have felt like an age. It’s almost here, however, and I’ve had the opportunity to try it out and see if all the suffering was worth it.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">If you aren’t familiar, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a spin-off of the venerable 1996 arcade classic. As the name implies, Leikir has transplanted the run-and-gun gameplay to the grid-like fields of a turn-based strategy game. And while those two genres are vastly different, there is very little in this world that can’t be improved with the presence of Fiolina Germi.</p> <figure data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The narrative of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is hardly surprising. Mainstay antagonist, General Morden, has escaped and is… bad. The demo doesn’t really suggest any subtext. You play as the good guys, and the rebels are the bad guys. Blow them up. It’s actually kind of annoying how little the dialogue tries to show personality. Leikir’s maybe afraid of straying too far from the source material, but the result is just empty.</p>
 <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">That’s not terribly important, considering you’ll spend most of your time viewing a battlefield grid. However, I have more bad news for (some of) you: It’s a roguelite.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">You select your three characters in the garage, and then they speed out to a selected region. You’re then set loose to complete a set number of missions before the boss shows up. If you can defeat the boss, you complete the region.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">In between missions, you’re provided with random perks and equipment, which are only available for that run. Likewise, your characters level up, but once the run is complete, they’re back to square one. Permanent progress is made by buying upgrades for the perks you’re given as options.</p> <figure data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - New trailer | Coming Fall 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">The framework doesn’t bother me. The luck required to have the best perks show up between missions is the major reservation here, but the roguelite injection at least means that the battles depend more on skill than simply leveling up your characters. Your success is based mostly on how deftly you can cut through missions to get their rewards.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">And there is a deceptively high skill ceiling. Characters use their skills by spending adrenaline, and adrenaline is built up by traveling to the extremes of their movement range.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Beyond that, however, unit placement is important to utilize sync attacks. Essentially, if one of your characters attacks while that enemy is in another unit’s sights, the stationary unit will add to the attack. If you’re careful and need to take down a particularly hefty enemy, you can position three characters so they’ll each join in for one big attack.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">There’s no requirement to follow the turn order, either. Sometimes, a character will get a bonus move for performing an action, which allows you to reposition them. If you take advantage of this, they can act in two separate sync attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">The importance of placement in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> means that things keep moving and rarely slow down. There isn’t a lot of importance placed on sync attacks at the beginning, either, so it can make the game feel deceptively simple.</p> <figure data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">There’s a variety of missions that pop up which range from escort missions to enemy extermination. Each one has a sub-objective which will net you additional bonuses if you can pull them off.</p> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The boss battles are a bit more interesting. The demo only has a single one against Big Shiee, the Yamato-style battleship on treads. I was delighted since it’s also my favorite boss from across the series.</p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">The battle is interesting since your soldiers leap across floating cargo containers. Every couple turns, a section of ground will drop into the water, killing anyone atop them. You have to attack Big Shiee in the middle, but you can’t simply ignore the soldiers who pop up with every new clump of junk. This means you have to keep moving and take your shots on the big ship whenever you have an opening. It’s pretty enjoyable, though there seems to be some effects missing in the demo.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, the visuals are nice but not exactly up to the legendary standards of the original series. It’s pretty difficult to live up to Nazca’s pixel art, but it’s not bad. My biggest issue with the visuals is the menus and HUD, which don’t share the pixelated art of the gameplay. Any high-resolution text next to a pixel art backdrop is going to look awful. They might as well use Comics Sans.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">After some hesitation, I eventually began enjoying my time with <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. It’s a deceptively simple strategy game, not unlike something such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-chroma-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma Squad</a></em>. Its link with the <em>Metal Slug </em>series feels largely cosmetic, but Leikir is making the most of it by incorporating familiar bosses and enemies.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">I’m not blown away, but I am looking forward to when the full version arrives this Fall. I’d like to see greater enemy variety, most of all. Tanks were mentioned in the demo, but aside from the eponymous Metal Slug, there were none to be seen. Here’s hoping that this small slice of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is just the foundation for something special.</p> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false"><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is releasing on PC and consoles in Fall 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-creator-veilguard-romance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>creator David Gaider has weighed in on the romance system that will be featured in the forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and it sounds like he's not a fan of the way the game will handle relationships.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche confirmed that it will be possible to romance any companion you like in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, in a manner similar to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>(with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/who-are-minsc-and-jaheira-baldurs-gate-3">two notable exceptions</a> in that case).</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins&nbsp;</em>writer and series creator David Gaider has given his thoughts on&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s romance system, and he's less than pleased with it due to how he feels it limits character development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-david-gaider-companions.jpg?itok=YZLWhh1s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-david-gaider-companions.jpg?itok=yMN8H9ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to romance any of your companions in&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421129502118278" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather refreshingly even-handed thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Gaider says that he understands some&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fans will just want to romance "whoever they want", and that not getting to do so is "tantamount to a slap in the face".</p>
<p>Despite that, he says that making characters romanceable "limits the type of character they can be" insofar as they'll always need to be "appealing" to the player, which restricts the writing team to only being able to tell certain types of stories.</p>
<p>Gaider says this is the reason Varric wasn't romanceable in&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>; making him a romance option would have "destroy[ed] his character", according to Gaider.</p>
<p>Making any character romanceable by any player character destroys their "agencies", according to Gaider, transforming them into "sex dolls" rather than fully-rounded people with their own stories to tell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-2-david-gaider-the-veilguard.jpg?itok=o1Iaj5SD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-2-david-gaider-the-veilguard.jpg?itok=NeftYlib 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2</em>'s cast were pansexual, but not all of them were romanceable.</figcaption></figure><p>Gaider does, however, admit that his opinion is a "personal (and uncharitable) preference", going on to say that if&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s writers "unapologetically lean into" romanceable characters, it "should be fine".</p>
<p>He does also have some thoughts about&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s romanceable companions, though, saying that several of the game's characters "would have had a stronger arc" if they couldn't be romanced.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Gaider's worries come to pass in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but if you want to get a sense for how the game plays on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">hands-off preview right here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Square Enix has released a launch trailer for Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail, giving a new look at the MMORPG expansion's story.
</p>
<p>
Until now, we've only been given details of the story at the Fan Fest events from director and producer Naoki Yoshida, along with a CGI trailer of the expansion's new setting and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrails-adorable-new-job-revealed">Jobs</a>.
</p>
<p>
This launch trailer provides an in-game look at what players can expect from the world of Tural: from stormy seas, to cyberpunk cities. Check it out below.
</p>

<figcaption>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail launch trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BghYTigv8E" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>

As previously reported, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a> takes place in the western continent of Tural known as the New World. The Scions and the player's Warrior of Light will take part in a contest for the Tural throne to become the next Dawn Servant.
</p>
<p>
In the new trailer, we see the Scions sailing off on a ship across stormy seas joined by new character and female Hrothgar Wuk Lamat.
</p>
<p>
From there the trailer hints at various story threads, so spoiler warning if you're looking to go in with zero knowledge. Though honestly, it brings up more questions than answers. Who, for instance, is the mysterious woman at the very end?
</p>
<p>
What's more, with this being in-game footage, it gives a strong look at the new graphical update that's coming with Dawntrail and the 7.0 series of patches.
</p>
<p>
We see boss battles, dungeons, futuristic cities, new characters, and more. In short, it looks spectacular.
</p>
<p>During a Letter from the Producer Live today, further details on the game were provided. Perhaps the most useful addition is the ability to hide player characters around a quest giver, something which should be helpful during peak times of play - the expansion's launch in particular.</p> <div>

I recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">hands-on with a preview of Dawntrail</a> and described it as Final Fantasy 14 at its most colourful, thanks not only to the graphical update, but the new Pictomancer Job and the holiday setting.
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also told me there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">"almost no chance" of server woes for the Dawntrail launch</a>, after major issues with previous expansion Endwalker.

I’ve always asserted that <em>Inquisition </em>has one of BioWare’s best stories and casts, but they’re buried under a lot of open-world nonsense and real-world time-gated mechanics that make it impossible to see everything in a timely manner. The “Story Mode” mods target several of the most time-consuming parts of <em>Inquisition</em>, from the War Table that requires you to wait in real-time (from a few minutes to several hours) to complete quests to the “Power” mechanic that gates the main story quests by making you do side quests to increase your influence.</p><p>I haven’t replayed <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>in several years at this point, but playing it the first time, I knew its biggest weakness is how much all the superfluous live-service-esque nonsense gets in the way of enjoying its excellent critical path.

And if you’re new to the series, I’d recommend playing through the other games, too, and specific DLCs for each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-metal-gear-solid-3-is-the-best-prequel-ever-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Metal Gear Solid 3 and Metal Gear Solid 4.</strong></p><p>It’s been a long time coming but Metal Gear fans finally have something concrete to look forward to. Although series creator Hideo Kojima has moved on to other projects, his long-beloved stealth action franchise is making a grand return to the forefront of gaming with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</u></a>. Now that we have our first look at Delta’s gameplay from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trailer-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>new trailer</u></a> shown at the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>Xbox Games Showcase</u></a>, we’re even more excited to get our hands on it. But for now, we want to take a look back at the original Metal Gear Solid 3, which will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year on November 17th, 2004.</p><p>Specifically, we’re going to talk about how MGS3 tells a more vital prequel narrative than most other franchises can match. What was at the time seen as a course correction from Metal Gear Solid 2’s lack of Solid Snake playtime and perhaps even a delaying action of paying off 2’s narrative threads to the eventual Metal Gear Solid 4, the benefit of hindsight has shown that MGS3 is a critical installment in the series’ mythology. Sure, it received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>great reviews</u></a> on release, but why does the story not really work if you just played MGS1, 2 and 4 as a trilogy when they happen in chronological order? Let’s take a look at what makes MGS3 so essential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A New Mission</h2><p>After two games set in a “few years in the future” sci-fi setting, Kojima went in an entirely new direction with Metal Gear Solid 3. The mechanics and systems he used to create such iconic stealth action gameplay in MGS1 and 2 could have been iterated on to even greater success, but 3 made the bold leap of developing new ways to engage with the genre. From the camo index system where players had to adjust their disguise to match their surroundings, needing to hunt for food in the wild to keep up stamina, curing serious injuries in the field, and depriving players of many of the futuristic gadgets that were so helpful in previous games, MGS3 forced fans to rethink their strategies as they explored the Soviet jungle in pursuit of objectives.</p><p>The mission took players through a variety of exotic locations and exciting sequences, with the Shagohod chase in particular being one of the best action set pieces on the PlayStation 2. Yet if the Metal Gear franchise is known for anything gameplay wise besides stealth, it’s a penchant for creative boss fights against bizarre villains, and MGS3 has one of the best rogue’s galleries in the franchise. The Cobra Unit were incredibly expressive both in visual design and how they let the ways they fought give players an insight into their personalities instead of each one telling an elaborate backstory as they died. The bosses interacted with the new gameplay systems, such being able to use camo to hide from The Fury, or tricky players giving The Fear food poisoning using rotten food to quickly drain his stamina. The crown jewel of the Cobra fights was The End, which used a massive environment and all the game’s stealth mechanics to create a proper sniper’s duel that for some players went on for over an hour.</p><p>Kojima’s talent for merging story and gameplay reaches its peak in the game’s final encounter: the battle between Snake and The Boss. With only 10 minutes before the arena is bombed to smithereens, all of the skills players developed over the course of the journey, especially in regards to sneaking and CQC, are tested as they try to defeat Snake’s old mentor. The white flowers and trees of the arena matching The Boss’ outfit, the slow build up of the Snake Eater theme song as the timer winds down, and forcing the player to push the button to deliver the final shot during what appears to be a cutscene all coalesce to form one of the most artistically resonant final battles in game history. The design template Kojima used in previous games is expanded and refined into its purest form in MGS3, making the game a fitting prequel not just in story, but also in gameplay.</p><h2>In Love and (Cold) War</h2><p>Set in 1964, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, at first glance, a back to basics take on the Metal Gear series. Snake is back in the lead role, albeit technically not the same one as previous games, with the protagonist instead being the <em>original</em> Snake, aka Big Boss, whose DNA was used to create the clones Solid, Liquid and Solidus. The setup is essentially classic MGS action but in the jungle, and with a 007-style spy thriller/romance angle added on top. The complicated philosophical concepts and labyrinthine bad guy plans from MGS2 are dropped for a more straightforward Cold War story about Snake trying to stop a nuclear war from breaking out, while also dealing with his relationships with his apparently traitorous mentor, The Boss, and his budding maybe-maybe-not romance with his spy companion EVA.</p><p>What some likely took as an artistic retreat from Kojima into less controversial territory has instead revealed itself over the years to be a conscious addition of key emotional context to what had become a sprawling multi-decade saga. Trying to connect all the various threads of MGS lore and the political machinations of dozens of characters and factions can be a dizzying prospect, but MGS3 cuts through the chaff and reminds the audience that these are stories not just about nations and lofty ideas but about characters, ones who MGS3’s script mines for a surprising amount of depth. At the center of it all is Snake, a man and soldier still holding onto the last of his ideals, only to lose all of it as he “succeeds” in the mission that would break both him and his hope in his country.</p><p>His battles with The Boss, who is revealed to not be a traitor but instead a patriot allowing her reputation to be destroyed in order to preserve world peace, shatter Snake’s faith in everything he’d ever been led to believe in. Meanwhile, his romance with EVA turning out to be a ruse to pilfer him of the Philosopher’s Legacy ruins his ability to put trust in anyone besides his fellow soldiers. These two relationships crumbling not only gives an answer as to why he eventually becomes Big Boss, the villain of the original two Metal Gear games on the MSX2, but also establishes that the recurring theme of soldiers being betrayed by their governments and wanting to build nations of their own that had been one of the central running motifs of the series, has a foundation that goes beyond the conflict fans were already familiar with. Even before Solid Snake was born, this was just a fact of this world, and cementing that world is what makes MGS3 so crucial to its immediate successor.</p><h2>A Solid Circle</h2><p>Besides telling its own story, MGS3 also adds important definition to the world of Metal Gear that helps solidify (hah) the plot threads that MGS4 would conclude. Sure, in timeline order, MGS4 is technically a sequel to MGS2. But when looking at the actual meat of plot and world-building, MGS3 is the game that most informs MGS4. We’re talking about more than basic stuff like learning about the Shagohod, which was the genesis from which Metal Gear technology would later develop, or introducing the character of Big Boss to series fans who never played the original two MSX games (which, let’s be honest, is most of them). MGS4 only works as an ending to the saga because of how it builds off of MGS3’s themes and characters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nothing that happens in MGS3 is a “bonus”; it is the beating heart of a saga Kojima had been telling across numerous games since 1987</p></div><p>The idea that the conflicts between soldiers and their governments that led Big Boss and other Metal Gear villains into wanting to establish some version of Outer Heaven are cyclical across history only sells if we’ve actually seen that conflict, well, <em>across</em> history. The reveal that EVA is the one who gave birth to Solid and Liquid and truly did love Big Boss despite her betrayal would come out of nowhere without us becoming invested in her in MGS3. And without getting to know them when they were young and charismatic, the twist that the Patriots, the ultimate villains of the entire Metal Gear saga, were in fact the mission support team who helped the original Snake (and by extension, the player) in the 1960s wouldn’t register as such a tragic gut-punch.</p><p>Sure, there are worthwhile prequels that fill in lore gaps or recontextualize aspects of plot or character: Rogue One, Andor, Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, and Furiosa to name a recent few. But what makes MGS3 stand out from the pack is that in most other cases, later stories in the timeline work perfectly well on their own without the prequel material. Metal Gear stories set after MGS3, such as MGS4, MGS5 or Peace Walker, don’t really function dramatically without knowing the story from MGS3. Nothing that happens in MGS3 is a “bonus”; it is the beating heart of a saga Kojima had been telling across numerous games since 1987. It is the connective tissue that brings the original MSX games, the early Solid series, and the final entries together into a single whole. That it’s also an excellent title on its own terms, full of some of the series’ most exciting action set pieces and strongest character work, only further cements its status as the greatest prequel ever made.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

These are still incredibly popular, meaning this is extremely time-sensitive as they could sell out. but we couldn't just sit by and not shout about it. The <a href="https://ebay.us/GuTzfB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collector's Edition is down to £203.96 at the moment for PS5</a> and <a href="https://ebay.us/oYMrp0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox</a> using code DAYLIGHT15. This is the best preorder deal in the UK right now, and over £26 off the list price of £229.99. </p><div><div id="197236"><p><h3>PS5 Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector Edition</h3></p></div><div id="197237"><p><h3>Xbox Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector Edition</h3></p></div></div><p>This promo code is applicable across the whole of eBay, but preorders for one of the most anticipated DLC expansions of all time certainly caught our eye, especially as it's for the Collector's Edition. But, the DAYLIGHT15 code will expire by June 17 at 11:59 PM, so there's a limited time left to secure this offer. If they are out of stock by the time you're reading this again, make sure you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/IGNUKDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IGNUKDeals</a> on Twitter/X for immediate updates for when they come back. </p><p>So what's included? Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree (base game not included), a Figurine of Mesmer the Impaler (46cm), an exclusive hardcover artbook (English), and a Digital Soundtrack. This sounds perfect for any big fans or collectors out there, so there's no like the present to get your order in. Plus, we likely won't see a better deal than this before the release on June 21.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In case you slept on this game when it first came out, we liked it rather a lot. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">our review</a>, the first ever 10 we've given a FromSoftware game, we said: "Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads I didn’t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever played." </p><p>It was also recently announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring has sold 25 million units ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.

Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-sales-swell-to-an-incredible-23-million">the game crossed 23 million units sold in March 2024</a>, meaning it's grown another two million in less than three months.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/there-was-no-e3-but-microsoft-won-it-anyway-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Just by treating the summer showcase events as a serious competitive opportunity, Xbox has come away with its best public image boost in years</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>There is at least one long-standing E3 tradition that has now outlived E3 itself: the picking of winners and losers from the event.</p>
<p>This is a distributed, largely subjective process of judgment and evaluation which has on some occasions been quite spurious and misguided, but at other times has genuinely set the tone for the competitive landscape of the year to come. Whatever failings ultimately sank E3 – and there were many, many failings – the show's position on the calendar was no accident. It remains perfectly balanced right at the point when companies have locked down their holiday release schedules and are ready to start looking forward to the following year's tentpole titles; with or without a trade show to anchor it, the start of June is always going to be a milestone games companies are focused on.</p>
<p>Consequently, it's always going to be an opportunity to take the pulse and temperature of the industry's market leaders – if not to declare outright winners and losers, then at least to get a sense of where we're going in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>All of this musing is not really required this year, I suppose, because this is one of those rare years in which there's an obvious winner: Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft 'won' whatever this echoed remnant of E3 is, and it wasn't even close. You can measure that by just about any metric you fancy, if you want to get all quantitative about it; the games Microsoft announced and showed off garnered the most attention and acclaim no matter what yardstick you choose to use. Perhaps for the first time since the Xbox 360 generation, Microsoft is walking away from (the ghost of) E3 with a forward software pipeline that's very clearly head and shoulders ahead of its rivals' offerings thus far – an incredibly important shot in the arm not only for public perception of Xbox (which has been having a tough time in the past year) but also, no doubt, for confidence within the company itself.</p>
<p>The caveat – and it's a big one – is that one other thing that was very clear over the past week is that there are a bunch of different visions for what Not-E3 is and what role it should play, and there was a strong sense that Sony had prepared a set of announcements for a very different event to the one Microsoft envisioned.</p>
<p>That's Sony's mistake, if so; Microsoft came to the table with an incredibly solid presentation that stacked high-profile, fan-favourite titles one after the other in a way that would easily have ranked as a top-notch E3 event back when E3 still existed. Sony's more meagre offering felt like a pretty standard announcement livestream shoehorned into a fortnight of larger events, and it's fairly likely that that's what it was (and quite likely that Nintendo's Direct event in the coming days will be similarly low-key).</p>
<blockquote><p>One good event won't fully turn around public perception dented by studio closures and ill-considered statements, but it finally feels like Xbox is ready to offer genuine competition to PlayStation</p></blockquote>
<p>This creates a visibility problem; we know that Microsoft took the Not-E3 opportunity very seriously and has shown us a pretty significant chunk of what it's got in the pipeline (which is great), but it's really not clear how much of Sony's upcoming software roadmap we've actually seen, and it's unlikely we'll get more than a cursory glimpse of Nintendo's plans. The discord between these companies' visions of what the June showcase season means and what it's for is an echo of the wider discord that ultimately spelled the end of E3 itself, torn between too many competing visions of what the show could be and should do.</p>
<p>None of that detracts from Xbox finally getting to put on a genuinely fantastic show. On the strength of what we've seen so far, Xbox is the platform to beat in terms of software offerings for the next 12 to 18 months. This is the first time that it's really felt like Microsoft's incredibly expensive acquisition spree is paying full dividends; there's still a lot of work for the platform to do (one good event won't fully turn around public perception dented by studio closures and ill-considered statements), but it finally feels like Xbox is ready to offer genuine competition to PlayStation in ways that actually matter. The last time that was the case, we were all a hell of a lot younger. Then, too, the stars aligned in a similar way; Microsoft finding its feet as a software publisher just as Sony stumbled, falling victim, in many ways, to its own success.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains possible that Sony has far more to show, especially with regard to the 2025 pipeline – this year is already something of a write-off, the success of Helldivers 2 and the buckets of charm of Astro Bot notwithstanding.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Microsoft has an impressive line-up of titles due in the next 12 to 18 months</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the consequences of this new, disjointed and disparate set of summer events is that there's no consensus on what you do and don't announce at Not-E3. Take hardware, for example; Microsoft mentioned some new SKUs of its consoles, but Sony didn't whisper a word about the spec-bumped Pro model we know is coming later this year, and we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">already know that we won't see anything about the Switch successor</a> in Nintendo's Direct event next week.</p>
<p>In E3's heyday, these new hardware reveals would have been a given (at least for Sony; Nintendo has always been unpredictable in this regard, doing weird things like revealing new devices at the Tokyo Game Show, despite not even having a booth at the show itself).</p>
<p>The lack of any mention of new hardware, then, makes you wonder what other editorial choices were being made. Sony chose to lead on hero shooter Concord, which looks like a perfectly fine game but in retrospect was a poor choice for showcase flagship, given the tough contrasts with Microsoft's hit-after-hit approach, announcing a ton of major titles one after the other. Microsoft even dodged the bullet I was already flinching in anticipation of, namely turning at least one of those huge announcements sour by making the game live service.</p>
<p>The assumption most consumers who followed the showcases (which is a lot of people – the cumulative views on the various versions of these events uploaded to YouTube are immense) will come away with is that Sony's big franchise updates and new titles from its most valued studios are still too early in development to show off, which could speak to a very quiet 2025 release schedule – not a great look for the market leader – but this could just be an editorial decision.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is no Giant Enemy Crab moment, but it's very rare to see PlayStation look so weak in terms of its pipeline</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe there's a plan to announce a bunch of upcoming games alongside the PS5 Pro reveal at an event later in the year. Gamescom in late August and TGS in September are both well-timed options for something like that; equally, the online nature of modern showcases and announcements means Sony could just throw a dart at a calendar and pick a date that suits it, which was never really an option until relatively recently.</p>
<p>All of this speaks to very divergent visions of what Not-E3, or some eventual E3 replacement, should be from the three platform holders who matter most – and it's worth noting that some other very important platform holders, like Apple and Google, weren't really there at all; it remains a little unfathomable to me that with the exception of a brief nod at Apple's WWDC event, the mobile platform holders don't try to elbow into this space with game showcases of their own.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, there's no denying that the past two weeks have had a little of the old E3 magic, at least viewed from where I sit all the way over on another continent, in a very inconvenient timezone. The appetite from consumers for these showcase events is very clear, and many publishers seem to have really decided to focus on this as an opportunity for major announcements in a way that's been absent for quite a few years. The value of this point on the calendar as an opportunity to bring a ton of eyeballs to the games that the industry is teeing up for the rest of the year and beyond has not faded – but the biggest market players of all are taking very, very different approaches to what that means.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see how this year's event shapes the evolution of companies' attitudes into next year. Sony is far out in front as market leader, but it would nonetheless be foolish not to feel at least a little bit shaken by the stark difference in the public reception to its event and to Microsoft's event. That really should spur something of a re-examination of its strategy towards this showcase season.</p>
<p>It's not the worst slip-up – this is no Giant Enemy Crab moment, by any means – but it's been very rare in recent years to see PlayStation look so weak in terms of its forward pipeline by comparison with its rivals. Sony should be very wary of letting that perception last long, or worse, letting it be reinforced by future events. No matter how far in front PlayStation may be right now, it's still up against a fiercely competitive rival with nearly $100bn of studios and publishers in its back pocket, and Sony cannot assume that it will get to set the rules and the pacing for public announcements and showcases in future.</p>
<p>The summer showcase season should be a competition, and every major company should be bringing their A game; perhaps it's precisely in that rekindled spirit of industry competition that we might, in time, find a coherent form for a true successor event to E3.</p>

        <p>IGN Playlist data reveals the purchase intent of gamers from the last two weeks</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Astro Bot is the winner of the summer games showcases (so far), with the most wishlists of all the games shown and announced over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The data comes from IGN Playlist, which is a backlog and play activity tracker that is available on the web and via a mobile app.</p>
<p>The chart below is based on the purchase intent of over 43,000 gamers, and factors in new wishlists from May 30 (the day of the PlayStation State of Play conference) to June 12.</p>
<p>The interest in Astro Bot may come as a bit of a surprise. After all, Sony stated earlier in the year that it didn't plan to release any major new titles based on existing IP this year, and this game is due September 6. Therefore, it's likely even PlayStation had modest expectations for the game.</p>
<p>But Astro Bot is the successor to Astro's Playroom, an extended tech demo that was included with every PS5 sold (over 56 million units so far). As a result, Sony has exposed the Astro series to a very large audience already (including the crucial and lucrative early adopter audience), and we might just be seeing some of that audience returning for the sequel.</p>
<p>PlayStation may hold the top spot, but the rest of the Top Ten is dominated by games that featured in Xbox's showcase. The No.2 spot belongs to Doom: The Dark Ages by Bethesda, which opened Microsoft's show. The shooter is also coming to PS5 so has a larger addressable market than some of the other Xbox games in this list, such as Gears of War: E-Day at No.3, and Perfect Dark at No.4.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting about this chart is that it just counts people who wishlisted games <em>during</em> this two-week period. This naturally favours new games that were announced over the past two weeks, whereas games that were available to wishlist prior to this period (such as Assassin's Creed Shadows at No.5, Fable at No.8, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at No.9), will already have had a base of interest that isn't factored in here.</p>
<p>The biggest new IP of the showcases was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is an RPG from independent developer Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler. The game just about comes ahead of another new IP in South of Midnight from Compulsion Games and Xbox, which received its first gameplay trailer last week.</p>
<p>Kepler has two games in the Top 25 most wishlisted titles, with Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn at No.21.</p>
<p>There were a few well received indie games that have made the Top 25, too. Mixtape from Beethoven and Dinosaur, and published by Annapurna, impressed during the Xbox showcase and that has translated to wishlists, coming in at No.15. Meanwhile, Neva, which was a much talked about game from Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest event, is at No.20.</p>
<p>Overall, although sequels dominate the Top Five, there's a decent number of new IP in this list, with nine original games overall.</p>
<p>This is ultimately just an early snapshot from the summer games showcases. Nintendo has yet to host its Direct video, and there will be plenty of media coverage to come from the games shown over the past two weeks. Therefore, we will look to provide a further update to this chart in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, which is now part of the IGN group of websites, will continue to publish IGN Playlist insight and data moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-reveals-talisman-5th-edition-expansion-and-new-heroquest-beginner-set<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Avalon Hill is a board game publisher known by many for the long-running games like <em>Talisman, HeroQuest, </em>or <em>Betrayal At House On The Hill</em>. While it was only recently that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop"><em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> was revealed </a>they aren't done with the announcements yet as they invited us to hear about their upcoming RPG slate. We got to hear from Patrick O'Rourke, Director of Product Management, Cait Drouin, Associate Manager of Product Management, and Doug Hopkins, Game Designer of <em>HeroQuest, Talisman</em>, and many other titles about what else to expect.</p>
<p>Starting off the session more information was given about some of the recently announced titles.</p>
<h3><em>Heroquest: Jungles of Delthrak</em></h3>
<p><em>Heroquest: Jungles of Delthrak</em> is a new expansion. Global Preorder launched May 31st, can be pre-ordered now, and will be available on August 1st.</p>

<p>Drouin explained that this expansion will take you to a jungle where a dwarven relic is the object of a number of factions eyes. Choose your own adventure with 16 brand new quests, new characters, and miniatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopkins explained that this will be before <em>Crypt of Perpetual Darkness,</em> but when it's being tested they do it with new characters so that any of the catch up mechanics are balanced. The idea is to keep it a sandbox feel but add more to that Sandbox.</p>
<p>DMs will have five new artifacts, new heroes, new monsters, new tiles. All to better fit the new jungle aesthetic. One of the Artifacts is the Sapphire Skull "This legendary relic is crafted from precious cobalt gemstone. It imbues you with poise and assurance. While wielding this artifact, roll 2 Attack dice against any one monster in your line of sight." This is meant to help the Wizard have a ranged attack.</p>
<p>Berserker and Explorer are adjacent to the Barbarian and Dwarf. These were made to compliment the older classes while creating characters with wholly new abilities. The Explorer will be responsible for finding treasures along the way while the Berserker can unlock different abilities as their health gets lower.</p>

<p>As well as hero minis there are also a wide variety of new monsters and tools. Minis included are dinosaurs, spiders, giant apes, as well as some old familiars. Enemies like the Cultist have also been updated to make them more versatile for any encounter.</p>
<p>Explaining the Choose Your Own adventure features they wanted to create an experience where players from different parties could share their own way they got through the story. You could end the quest book in a wholly different way that a friend does.</p>
<p>"This gives players more choice and agency over their own characters"</p>
<h3><em>Talisman: The Magical Quest Game - 5th Edition</em></h3>
<p>Announced at Cannes in Festival des Jeus in February. It's available for pre-order now and will be available in retail July 1st.</p>
<p>This version is going to be one that promotes player agency, this is not just to create a better experience for the players but also to make sure that players had a better control over how long the game will go.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to collect the Crown of Command that's being protected by an elder dragon. There are a lot of new things added to the board including the ability to purchase a boat or find a cave to progress, things that cause players to lose turns have also been reduced. Those negative events also have a chance to be mitigated with rolls.</p>

<p>Hopkins wanted to make sure that as they've made a number of smaller choices the aim was to create a more streamlined experience that lets players get to the things that they want to do even faster. In playtesting Hopkins explained with five players new to one another it was 2 hours for them to play through <em>Talisman</em>, a stark difference from the 4 hours that a 4th Edition could last for.</p>
<p>If you're still after that 'classic' <em>Talisman </em>experience though the expanded rules will be available in the instruction manual in an alternate ruleset section.</p>
<p>A variety of the minis that will be included in <em>Talisman </em>were shown off. A troll with a spiked club and an elderly bearded wizard were highlighted as some particular favorites of those from the Avalon Hill team.</p>
<h2>New Announcements</h2>
<h3><em>Talisman Alliances</em></h3>
<p>As we moved into hearing about new products a trailer was shown for <em>Talisman 5e</em> as well as <em>Talisman Alliances</em>, an expansion coming in the near future. This expansion, which requires the base 5th edition box to play, is a new game mode that lets you play with others cooperatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Work together with your fellow players to overcome unique challenges called trials"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players will need to share resources and fate to complete these five trials before they're able to complete the game.</p>
<p>Hopkins explained that there will be a number of closed off boxes that you open in sequence. You'll have to complete Trial 1 before you can open the box to Trial 2. It was clarified that this isn't meant to be like a legacy game, instead it's "just a way of rolling out the experience one Trial at a time."</p>

<p>To give a better idea of what these trials look like we were treated to the Introduction for Trial 1: Desperate Accord. A large part of the Trial is the Doom Tracker, this essentially puts the players on a race against the clock.</p>
<p>Hopkins explains that with this expansion they wanted to create a new way for new and old fans to interact with the world of <em>Talisman</em>. Pre-orders for <em>Talisman Alliances</em> is available today as of 10am EST and the expansion will be released October 1st.</p>
<p>While future <em>Talisman </em>expansions were teased it was something that we'll need to wait to hear about.</p>
<h3><em>HeroQuest First Light</em></h3>
<p>The last announcement was for <em>HeroQuest First Light</em>. This is a starter set that will let players get a taste of the <em>HeroQuest </em>system that might be hesitant to dive into the current available system whether it be that they're unsure if they'd like the game or if they don't want to get into it at that price point.</p>
<p>This is a place for a new party to begin, to learn the ropes, and get involved in the world. This set is happening at the same time as the current core set. Hopkins teased that for new <em>HeroQuest </em>fans you'll experience the excitement and betrayal of <em>HeroQuest </em>for the first time.</p>

<p>From here you should then be able to purchase expansions and continue to play the game forward.</p>
<p>This box is designed for one DM and four players, if there are less than four players then it can also mean a player might be taking on the roles of a few characters in the party.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's about time for another look at the week in gaming business, and sadly, we've got some more grim numbers for you this week, with industry layoffs already surpassing last year's totals.</p>
<p>Several studios laid off employees or closed their doors for good this week, lending a rather moody coda to the summer gaming showcase season, and the week also featured some questionable comments by Xbox head Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Here's our roundup of this week's biggest gaming business news.</p>
<h2>2024's industry layoffs have surpassed 2023's figures</h2>
<p>We start today with a rather sad and grim figure. According to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this industry layoff tracker</a>, layoffs have reached a rough total of 10,800 this year, which means they've surpassed 2023's total already, despite the fact we've still got half of the year ahead of us.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-rollerdrome.jpg?itok=mtCuKtgM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-rollerdrome.jpg?itok=KsDh9TRx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So many studios have been hit by layoffs or closures that it might be faster to list the ones that haven't.</figcaption></figure><p>In late May, 2024 industry layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs">hit 10,000</a>, so there are just a few weeks between that unfortunate milestone and this one. In fact, the number is likely even higher than the tracker suggests, given that we don't have numbers for some of the companies listed.</p>
<p>Given these figures, the enthusiasm of the Summer Game Fest showcases feels misplaced, especially given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">some of the companies</a> excitedly demonstrating new games were the very same ones hit by the worst layoffs.</p>
<h2>Several studios hit by layoffs</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this week saw a wave of layoffs to add to the aforementioned counter, and some pretty big studios were affected, as well as some smaller outfits.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>developer Gumi announced that it plans to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/layoffs-hit-japan-as-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-developer-asks-80-employees-to-voluntarily-resign/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cut around 11% of its staff</a> this week, and Archiact, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">already been a victim of the layoff wave</a> this year, said goodbye to further staff members as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-freediver-triton-down.jpg?itok=FF8dUp8v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-freediver-triton-down.jpg?itok=F3Gl9R1u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>VR studio Archiact is just one of several hit by layoffs this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Contract studio Lionbridge, which has worked with Activision and other studios, reportedly laid off 160 employees, and Polygon's Nicole Carpenter <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800501544770748595" rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> these layoffs occurred due to "union organizing and inquiring about working conditions".</p>
<p>Further layoffs occurred at Sumo Group, which <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced plans to cut "up to 15%" of its staff</a>&nbsp;and to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timbre-games_there-is-no-better-group-of-people-in-games-activity-7206724903322984448-GoPR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">close down subsidiary Timbre Games</a>. We also saw <a href="https://ask.vrchat.com/t/an-email-from-our-ceo/25060?ref=uploadvr.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">layoffs of around 30%</a> at&nbsp;<em>VRChat</em>'s developer, which cites 2021-22 overhiring among its reasons for laying off employees.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Armello&nbsp;</em>studio League of Geeks <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">made a decision to go "into hibernation" this week</a>, citing "the economic situation in games" at the moment. This layoff and closure train sadly just keeps rolling, it seems.</p>
<h2>Phil Spencer's questionable comments at IGN Live</h2>
<p>During the tail end of the IGN Live event, Xbox's Phil Spencer made some comments about the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, as well as his own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shock decision to close Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin, and two other studios last month</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Spencer said that he "ha[s] to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow", and that this mandate requires him to make "hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=fqbMA5mC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=nUN0OFek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The subject of layoffs came up during this week's IGN Live, and Xbox head Phil Spencer certainly said some things.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q3/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't exactly doing badly right now in financial terms</a>&nbsp;and that Xbox has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-was-break-out-hit-for-microsoft-according-to-aaron-greenberg">referred to Tango's&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>as "a breakout hit"</a>, Spencer's comments seem mystifying, especially since he neglected to provide any kind of clarification regarding how exactly closing these studios would contribute to a "sustainable business".</p>
<p>It seemingly gets worse, though. During the aforementioned IGN Live event, the crowd cheered during Spencer's response to the question regarding studio closures, despite the fact that the question, and the response it demands, don't seem like a laughing matter.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BrunoRo11530134/status/1800156864438792348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a person who was apparently in the crowd</a> during that event, attendees were "told and pumped to cheer", with the loudest cheers getting prizes like <a href="https://x.com/BrunoRo11530134/status/1800641133598683466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gaming headsets</a>.</p>
<p>If that's true, it seems at best like a shamefully inadequate response to a problem that's sweeping the industry, and at worst like trying to force audience members to cheerlead a company that has just caused hundreds of people to lose their livelihoods.</p>
<h2>In other news...</h2>
<p>We've just got time to take a look at a couple of other stories that happened on the business side of the industry this week, and they don't involve layoffs, thankfully.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-games-boss-mike-verdu-moving-on-to-new-role" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Netflix Games boss Mike Verdu is moving on to a new role within the company. We don't know what that role is, but GI.biz says it involves "innovation in game development". How mysterious.</p>
<p>Finally, Embracer Group announced this week that it has <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">completed the divestment</a> of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>developer Gearbox, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in">sold to&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher Take-Two</a> back in March.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>That's all we've got for you on the industry side of things this week. Join us again next week when we'll take another look at what's been happening (and hopefully have a slightly less devastating layoff number to report).</p>

			<p>A couple of years ago, French developer Spiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-announced-will-launch-next-year-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the sequel to its solid 2019 roleplaying game. Back then, the studio was aiming for a 2024 launch window. Following a recent media presentation, we learned that the game will indeed debut this Summer, but only in early access. The full version will launch at some point in 205.</p>
<p>Contrary to that announcement, the studio has dropped the idea of making it a prequel. The game's events will instead run in parallel with the plot of the first title. What has not changed is that GreedFall 2: The Dying World will essentially keep the premise of the original by flipping the viewpoint: instead of journeying from Gacane to the island of Teer Fradee, you'll be doing the exact opposite (albeit not of your own volition) to explore the old continent. This still allows the studio to maintain the perspective of an outsider venturing into an unknown land.</p>
<p>The main character is a so-called Doneigad, a Sage, albeit a newly appointed one. While the build I've played did not allow for character customization, it will eventually be available later during the early access. The Doneigad's ultimate personal goal is, of course, to regain freedom, but a larger objective for the full game was teased by Spiders: stopping one man's crazed mission to bring destruction to the whole continent of Gacane.</p>
<p>In GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the protagonist will explore a variety of regions from Gacane, which is inspired by the European Baroque era. Players will encounter some of the factions from the first game, as well as a few new ones that weren't part of the Bridge Alliance expedition to Teer Fradee.</p>
<p>This is the first Spiders game to launch in early access. The studio provided several reasons for this choice, starting with the need to gather feedback from its fairly large community (the first game sold over two million copies). This ties in with the realization that the sequel is much bigger and, thus, will require more time to be fully polished. Furthermore, the studio is still working on improving the onboarding and combat system.</p>
<p>Players can expect around 30% of the full game to eventually make its way in the early access version, with more regions, companions, features, builds, and talents being released slowly through updates. Overall, the team aims for around 60 hours of playthrough for the full release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GreedFall2_Screenshot_07-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World begins on Teer Fradee, with the main character still considered a 'Vriden Gerr' (Rootless) about to go through the initiation ritual to become a Doneigad. Members of the Bridge Alliance have already arrived on the island and some natives are already blaming them for poisoning the land. Among the most hostile toward the 'invaders' is Nilan, one of the companions, while the other companion, Sheda, appears to be a potential romantic interest for the main character.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the version I played was still incomplete compared to the one that's going to be released on early access. Some conversations had the voice-over entirely missing, while in other cases, it was 'just' the facial animations that had placeholders. With those caveats, it's hard to fully judge the game's presentation. Having said that, GreedFall 2: The Dying World certainly looks pretty good. It's still powered by the studio's own Silk Engine, but it is clear there have been significant improvements, especially for the lighting component. The game didn't run perfectly, but that was to be expected, given the early build. NVIDIA DLSS is already integrated on PC, though.</p>
<p>The biggest change I noticed while playing this sequel is undoubtedly its new combat system. Spiders has always made action RPGs, ever since the days of Bound by Flame, The Technomancer, and GreedFall itself. You could move in real time, parry, dodge out of the way, et cetera.</p>
<p>This time around, they're switching to a far more tactics-based system. Everything still plays out in real time, but you can pause at any moment to take control of a companion (also new in GreedFall 2: The Dying World) and set them to do whatever you wish. There's even a combat log that keeps track of everything that takes place on the battlefield. On one hand, this is nice for those who'd like to play strategically. However, this also means the action element is completely gone. In fact, the characters will auto-attack now unless you give them orders to do specific skills, essentially requiring players to micro-manage at all times, at least on high difficulty settings. You can queue up to three skills for each character in a single order.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the feeling is completely different and may not be to everyone's taste. It is interesting that the developers would change the combat this much despite the success of the first installment. It's equally worth noting that BioWare's Dragon Age (which is obviously a huge inspiration for Spiders) is pretty much going in the other direction. Whereas the first game in that series, Origins, had tab-target-like tactical combat, following entries have moved increasingly toward action combat, and The Veilguard even <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> the ability to directly control companions (though, to be fair, you will still be able to pause combat and issue specific orders to your companions via the new ability wheel, making it still more tactical than the first GreedFall).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GreedFall2_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World, on the other hand, is transitioning from pure action to a slow tactics-based system. Needless to say, those Dragon Age fans who were yearning for a return to Origins will find respite here. As for me, I can't say I'm too excited about that particular change. However, I am very much looking forward to the new story in what I previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as one of the most unique fantasy settings created in recent games. There are also other additions, such as a new tracking vision mode that highlights environmental clues when scouring an area for information, and no doubt many more that I couldn't glean in the short two-hour hands-on.</p>
<p>I'll keep following the progress of GreedFall 2: The Dying World throughout early access and reporting back any significant content and feature updates. Stay tuned.</p>
