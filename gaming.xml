<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied in the hunt to boast full completion, with an extensive trophy list and achievements to hunt down.</p>



<p>The Bandai Namco title arrived to mark the start of a huge period for fans of the creature-catching genre, landing ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and there’s more than enough to digest—including mulling over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which Personality is best for each Digimon</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to tick off every task in the achievement and trophy list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, we’ve got the full to-do list for you.</p>

<p><strong>The trophy and achievement list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied, with rewards for story progression and completing specific tasks.</strong></p>



<p>Many of the achievements and trophies that are not hidden are unlocked through generic progression, which should be unlocked with ease by just playing through the game. However, there are tasks to train on the Digifarm a specific number of times and to spend YEN in shops.</p>



<p>A full list of the Digimon Story: Time Stranger trophies and achievements are below, with the hidden tasks separated later in this article.</p>

<p><strong>There are 46 achievements and trophies to unlock in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, including the illustrious Platinum trophy for obtaining all other trophies.</strong></p>



<p>That task is still present for those on Xbox, though it awards zero Gamerscore and is merely the mark of a completionist. As usual, Xbox players have 1,000 total Gamerscore to hunt down.</p>



<p>Additional trophies and achievements could arrive in post-launch content, with the Season Pass offering plenty of DLC in the first year of the game.</p>

<p>Looking for a pick-me-up on a chilly morning (or afternoon, or whenever you happen to be reading this)? This five-minute arrangement of classic Koji Kondo tracks from the Mario series just might do the trick.</p>
<p>Recorded back on 23rd August, the WDR Funkhausorchester takes a delightfully brisk jog through some classic platforming tunes, spanning 1985's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> (yes, that is now retro, folks) by way of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">SMB3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a>.</p>
<p>It's such a short and sweet arrangement that you may not want the included pieces spoiled. We'll put the timestamped titles at the bottom of the article, though - scroll down if you want 'em.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with this orchestra's oeuvre, the <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/orchester-und-chor/funkhausorchester/index.html">West German Broadcasting Cologne orchestra</a> has a broader focus beyond Classical...er, classics. So, in amongst your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0Ys6caA_o">Blue Danubes</a> and your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_i-CEoVQs">Paso Dobles</a>, they like to mix in some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mU41YusfQ">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkdCADxlYXs">Great Giana Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>And no, <em>Funkhausorchester</em> doesn't mean 'Funk House Orchestra'. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this cropped up on our feed and made us smile, so we thought we'd share. Let us know below if it gave a wee power-up on a Tuesday AM.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/baby-steps-secret-cutscene-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps%E2%80%99-secret-28-minute-cutscene-bizarrely-mentions-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog-and-bagels.1318228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans of the recently released Baby Steps have been humoured by the surfacing of a nearly 30-minute cutscene in the game that’s only unlocked after ticking some major boxes. If you skip every cutscene in the game (which is no simple feat), you’ll unlock a secret cutscene that runs for a whopping 28 minutes, but it’s <strong>bizarre</strong>.</p>



<p>The secret Baby Steps cutscene is simply the game’s two lead actors (and developers), Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy, sitting outside a log cabin and chatting about their real lives, including Game of Thrones rewatches, bagel fillings, and Naughty Dog’s games.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-miss-uncharted-i-wish-they-d-bring-it-back">‘I Miss Uncharted, I Wish They’d Bring it Back’</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to YouTube, one creator uncovered the full, secret cutscene in Baby Steps, which comes in at a staggering 28 minutes and is seen by some as a ‘punishment’ for skipping every cutscene in the game.</p>



<p>That’s how you unlock the secret cutscene – you have to skip <strong>everything </strong>that comes before.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Baby steps - Secret cutscene found" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a mildly motion-capped sequence that sees Nate (Gabe Cuzzillo) and Moose (Bennett Foddy) sitting outside a log cabin and chinwagging about life, pulling away from Baby Steps entirely, and gassing about all manner of things.</p>



<p>They test the limits of their motion capture equipment, rib the player for skipping cutscenes, and determine whether or not they should take a nap while being filmed.</p>



<p>At one point, they dive into the topic of Naughty Dog:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foddy: </strong>I miss Uncharted, I wish they’d bring it back.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>It has been a while.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I don’t think they’re going to do another new one.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That new one looks alright.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> Which one? The ‘space Uncharted’?</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>Yeah, that one looks good. I’m going to play that.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I’m not going to skip any of those cutscenes.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>You see how they put her jacket on, that’s insane!</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> People don’t know what’s involved in that.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That’s the most impressive thing I’ve seen in my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair go on to talk about putting broccoli in bagels, what else they had for lunch, and how Foddy’s Game of Thrones rewatch is going on, with Cuzzillo slipping in some casual spoilers for the viewers.</p>



<p>They even take a sidestep into talking about famous clowns, including Pennywise, The Joker, and Ronald McDonald.</p>



<p>As the segment unravels, the two actors discuss whether or not the player has skipped <strong>this </strong>cutscene before stressing that they need to use the bathroom and they can’t leave until things have played out to an undetermined end.</p>



<p>It ends with them ‘going to find the credits guy’ to get them rolling, suggesting that they’d ‘rough him up’ to bring in the end of the game. </p>



<p>This is probably one of the best secret cutscenes ever seen in a game, and it really humanized the actors quite nicely. Let me know if you already found this cutscene over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>

<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

                <p>FromSoft's massively popular--and just plain massive in general--received a co-op spinoff called Elden Ring: Nightreign earlier this year. The game sees groups of 1-3 players teaming up to take on the titanic threats in the new realm of Limgrave. It's been a hit with fans and critics alike, but it's also a big departure from the gameplay of the original Elden Ring. If you've been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a chance, as the Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring: Nightreign Deluxe Edition</a> is discounted to $45 for Big Deals Days. This retailer-exclusive edition offers access to post-launch DLC, a mini digital soundtrack, and a digital art book. It also comes with an exclusive poster of Nightreign's key art in the box. The deal applies to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMPV5JF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> of the game--but it's only available during Prime Big Deal Days on October 7 and 8.</p><div title="6535065 -- Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo Blu-rays" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4483" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535065 -- Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo Blu-rays" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVMVRN9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$45 (was $55)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While the combat mechanics in Nightreign are identical to Elden Ring, the overall structure is where you'll see some big differences. Players team up, choose a boss they want to fight, and then set off on an expedition that takes around 35- to 45-minutes to complete. This journey is split across three in-game days, as during the day your team will explore the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave--and level up for the fight ahead of them.</p><p>Before your squad gets to the main boss, they'll have to take on smaller bosses as the map closes in on them, and on the third day, the grand showdown begins. This core gameplay loop has gone over well with fans, and it has been further polished with post-launch support since then.</p><p>"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/">Elden Ring: Nightrein review</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it yet, the original Elden Ring game is also on sale. Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SPYK271?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 physical edition</a> for $30 (was $40), while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 and Xbox Series X versions</a> have been discounted to $40 (were $50). If you're planning to play on PS5, the PS4 deal is the best one here because Bandai Namco released a free upgrade for it a few years ago. This added an optional performance mode on PS5 that targets 60fps, increased graphical quality, ray tracing, and several other tweaks to Elden Ring's visuals. Elden Ring is considered to be one of From Software's greatest games, and is well worth picking up while it's discounted.</p><h2>Elden Ring Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173"></a><figcaption>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg"></figure><p>For a different spin on Elden Ring, check out the official Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree manga.

It's also part of Bandai Namco's infamous "UGSF" crossover universe that includes Galaga, Galaxian, Dig-Dug, Mr. Driller, and even Ace Combat 3 as canon entries--which means fans of classic Bandai Namco series can expect plenty of easter eggs and in-universe references to all those games and more. </p><p>Looking for more metroidvanias? You'll find a digital code for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Standard-Nintendo/dp/B0FPJHY6T3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on sale at Amazon as well. The highly anticipated game has lived up to the hype--though many find it to be remarkably difficult, thanks to punishing bosses and tricky environmental hazards.</p><p>For additional Pac-Man gear, check out the vibrant <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-MAN-5-foot-tall-full-size-stand-up-linux/dp/B0BYQNPTCF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up Pac-Man Deluxe Arcade Machine</a>. Along with several classic Pac-Man games, it lets you play titles like Dig Dug, Galaga, Mappy, and other retro hits. If you don't have the space for a full cabinet, the tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Classics-Pac-Man-4-Color-Screen/dp/B0CRX25RKK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade Classics: Pac-Man Edition</a> might be a better fit. It's much cheaper and fits in the palm of your hand, yet still comes with a color screen, classic music, and a tiny control panel.</p><p>For more Prime Big Deal Days discounts on video games, anime, and beyond, be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">GameSpot's deals hub</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-4k-blu-ray-best-deals/1100-6535093/">Prime Big Deal Days Movie Sale: Check Out Amazon's B2G1 Free 4K Blu-Ray Catalog</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-movie-4k-blu-ray-special-edition-steelbook-the-film-vault/1100-6534223/">The Shining's New Numbered Limited Edition Is Up For Grabs At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Upgrading your gaming rig during <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a> is a great idea, as over a dozen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=%20B0F77GW9RK,B0F4RVFBW7,B0F4RRQ2WY,B0FMC7V6X7,B0DS6WTXGP,B0FFKYJBDT,B0CVCG2VPK,B0F76KGH6B,B0F4RXQS6M,B0FFKWFMYM,B0DS6V7L5M,B0DQK4XSC7,B0971BG25M,B0F5BCCKY6,B0F5BD1X83,B0DTR54HZZ,B0DTQTJQGZ,B0DTQVHQ6G,B0DTRC7782&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs</a> are discounted for the shopping holiday. Many of these are <strong>available for their lowest price ever</strong>, with price cuts of over $100 for select models. This includes premium models capable of playing most modern games without a hiccup and budget-friendly options for those seeking to upgrade an entry-level PC during Amazon's sale, which lasts through October 8.</p><p>One of the biggest discounts is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS6WTXGP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (16GB GDDR7 OC Edition)</a>, as it's matching its best price ever of $850 (was $1,000). The RTX 5070 Ti is among the most powerful consumer GPUs available right now, and this OC Edition with 16GB GDDR7 should be more than capable of handling most games when played at high resolutions. If you don't need all the firepower provided by the RTX 5070 Ti, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFKWFMYM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 (12GB GDDR7 White OC Edition)</a> is now listed for just $580 (was $710). This card hasn't seen any notable discounts this year, so be sure to check it out during Prime Big Deal Days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580707" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580707"></a><figcaption>Asus TUF GeForce RTX GPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4580707-81lkyg-43rl._ac_sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Want to keep your spending under $500?

Essentially, this technology allows the CPU to retrieve data faster than expected, as it boasts an impressive 96 MB L3 cache (which is extremely noticeable while gaming). It's built on the 5nm Zen 4 architecture, and it's powerful enough for both gaming and work applications like photo editing or intense coding.</span></p><p>The 8-Core, 16-Thread processor is great at multitasking, so you shouldn't have any issues if you decide to stream a TV show or launch into Chrome while waiting for the next round of Counter-Strike. The 7800X3D is widely regarded as one of the best gaming processors on the market, and it's a hard bargain now that it's under $350.</p></div>                      </div><p>While we're big fans of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it's not the only CPU discounted for Prime Big Deal Days. Both AMD and Intel components are on sale--so be sure to shop around to find the best fit for your gaming setup. However, most will likely find the 7800X3D to be the best fit. If you don't mind stretching your budget, you can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Intel Core Ultra 9 Unlocked (24-Core, 24 Thread)</a> for $499 (was $599). Keep in mind that it's not designed for gaming, but folks running intensive video editing applications will find it to be a nice choice.</p><p>While the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Processor is quite budget-friendly with this new discount, there are plenty of cheaper options. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VCJ171S?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (6-Core, 12-Thread)</a> is down to $61 (was $159), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBJ59WJ4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12-Core, 24-Thread)</a> is $285 (was $549), and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">Intel Core i7-12700K (12-Core, 20 Thread)</a> is $185 (was $510). All three are reasonable choices for gaming, making them worthy alternatives if you're looking to save a few bucks.

<p>The rumours about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> getting ported to Nintendo's Switch successor have been doing the rounds on the internet for some time now.</p>
<p>In an update on this, podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' has responded to a recent comment <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1974887737678553101">on social media</a>, claiming the Switch 2 version does indeed "exist" (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/they-exist-red-dead-redemption-2s-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2-versions-are-still-happening-its-claimed/">thanks for the heads up, VGC</a>). As for the timing of the release, he's got no news to share at this stage.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b546e6866da9a"><a title="Red Dead Redemption 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b546e6866da9a/red-dead-redemption-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / via X</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">a rumour in May</a>, which reported "sources close to Rockstar Games" had indicated that the second entry starring Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang would be released on the Switch 2 within the current fiscal year - so, <em>before</em> the end of March 2026.</p>
<p>Rockstar is already gearing up for a huge 2026 after it announced the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/grand-theft-auto-6-has-been-delayed-and-will-now-launch-in-may-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> earlier this year. This anticipated release will now launch for Xbox and PlayStation platforms next year on 26th May.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> game was ported to the Switch in 2023. You can check out our review here on Nintendo Life for more information.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're still on the hunt for certain Switch 2 accessories and are looking for alternatives to Nintendo's products, there are plenty of third-party offerings already popping up. Accessory maker Turtle Beach recently released a headset, and it has now announced multiple other products.</p>
<p>This includes a new range of wired and wireless controllers, cases, and screen protectors. There's the Rematch, Afterglow Wave and Afterglow controllers, as well as a PlayTrek 2-in-1 Case and cases for the standalone system.</p>
<p>Controllers start at $29.99 / £24.99 wired, and will set you back $64.99 / £54.99 for a wireless one. Apart from different models (including features like Hall-Effect thumbsticks, RGB, and a GameChat button), there are also different designs available. The two-in-one PlayTrek carry case costs $49.99 / £39.99 and travel cases are priced between $19.99 / £14.99 - $29.99 / £19.99.</p>


<p>All of these are officially licensed products and pre-orders for these products are NOW <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2">live on the Turtle Beach website</a>. We also reviewed the company's Switch 2 headset not long ago, and thought it was a great budget accessory. Here's a quick summary, in case you missed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>There'll be no music updates next week</p>

<figure data-uuid="db765c62789c9"><a title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db765c62789c9/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fan favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> made its grand return last May, and in an update to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today, the game's soundtrack has <em>finally</em> been added.</p>
<p>This includes not only the <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/d87d523c-cb7c-4412-aafd-fa668b65defd">Switch version</a> of the soundtrack but also the original <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/1b466e17-95ee-4c62-9b97-14b4d7152cd8">GameCube album</a>. The Switch album is apparently loaded with a whopping 275 tracks, and there are 111 songs for the classic GameCube release.</p>
<p>Before you begin your jam session, just so you know - Nintendo won't be releasing any new tracks on the service next week. It didn't provide a specific reason for this, but there's a national holiday in Japan next week. It skipped weekly updates previously, which have also lined up with public holidays.</p>

<p>If you didn't play Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door back in the day, or haven't tried out the Switch version just yet, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We said it was still the king of Mario's RPG outings. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For 20 years, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the best Mario RPG of all time, and the Switch remake proves it has earned that title. This is a fantastic RPG adventure, whether you’re a Mario fan or not, with some best-in-class combat, brilliant writing, and a few little creases ironed out to make this the definitive way to play Thousand-Year Door."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>

Before a single line of dialogue hits viewers' ears, that song sets a tone, teases an emotional arc, and lets fans know whether a show is gonna punch them in the gut or kick their heart in its ass. Basically, a good OP is a part of an anime’s holy trinity: art style, voice cast, and theme song. When it slaps, you don’t skip it; you sing along with it week in and week out.&nbsp;</p><p>So when <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, the trashpunk shonen anime from Bones Film (of <em>My Hero Academia</em> fame), needed a new theme to match its explosive second cour, it wasn’t just about finding any fairweather musician to do the job. It needed someone who <em>gets it</em>. Someone who’s lived and breathed anime and knows what makes it work. Enter <a href="https://rollingstonejapan.com/articles/detail/38289/4/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mori Calliope</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | MAIN TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeRvDchyo44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mori Calliope isn’t just a megapopular VTuber with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_qhgtOy0dy1Agp8vkySQg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2 million subscribers</a> and a discography that goes hard—she’s also a diehard <em>Gachiakuta</em> manga fan who’s lowkey been fiending for this kind of opportunity. She’s a part of the crowd who liked it before its anime adaptation made it mainstream. Her upcoming <em>Gachiakuta </em>theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” aims to be a sonic embodiment of <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s volatile rage and righteous fury, mirroring Rudo’s descent into The Pit and his fight to reclaim justice.</p><p>In our chat, Mori Calliope broke down how “Let’s Just Crash” channels Rudo’s ongoing journey as the anime’s hero, how VTubbing let her cross the line from fan to creator, and how she hopes this collab will be the first of many to come as anime and VTubbing jointly become core tenets of pop culture.&nbsp;</p><h2>A VTuber manga reader fan’s dream come true</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">！？！？！？so happy！！！！</p>— 裏那圭◾️KEI URANA (@KEI_URANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KEI_URANA/status/1941380304159244710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> How did you first get involved with singing <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour theme—was it something you were approached to do, or was it something you wished to pursue as a fan of either Studio Bones' anime adaptation or Kei Urana’s ongoing manga?</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Mori Calliope:</strong> Honestly, it was a combination of both. I’ve been a fan of <em>Gachiakuta </em>since 2022. It was always in my heart—<a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1880242188539527568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being such a big fan of the manga</a>—that I thought to myself, “I’d really love to sing the opening for this manga whenever it becomes an anime.” I didn’t know if I could do it, though, or if I was the right choice or experienced enough, but sure enough, the offer came to me from my label. My producer wanted to meet with me to give me the good news, and that’s how I knew it was really good news.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn’t feel real at first when I got the offer, but as I started making the song, it became a lot more real very quickly. It’s been a crazy emotional time, but I’m really happy to have been given the opportunity as a huge fan of the manga. I’d even say it’s <a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1796936112876974332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favorite manga ever</a>, so I’m just really happy to be here.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="BEHIND GACHIAKUTA | Creators Interview &amp; Behind-the-scenes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQQF81ubINM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What about <em>Gachiakuta </em>drew you to liking it enough to want to make a theme song for it? Was there something about its world, tone, art style, or characters that immediately clicked with you and your musical style?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Honestly, I feel like the first thing that drew me into wanting to read more of the manga was definitely Urana's art style, because there's just this amazing combination of Western and Eastern sensibilities within the art. I'm a really big fan of Western cartoons. I know that Urana is also a fan of Western cartoons, and even back in the day when I used to draw, I'd combine those art styles together and always think, “I wish I could be better at this.” Seeing Urana’s art, I felt this is the exact style that I’ve longed to see in any piece of media and I just love it so much.&nbsp;</p><p>I also love the way Urana writes characters as well and their relationships with each other. Everybody’s got their own story going on, but they all intersect in a really beautiful way. And this overarching theme of becoming more and more human together in a dark and desolate world… I just love it so much. I think Urana’s a fantastic storyteller.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta Opening | &quot;HUGs&quot; by Paledusk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9f89PWhv8YE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s first cour opening, “Hugs” by metalcore band Paledusk, as well as its original soundtrack, saw the anime lean heavily into rap and heavy metal genres—things you’ve also embraced over the years with your own original songs. Having listened to your theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” I wanted to ask if there was a particular character, arc, or emotional beat in the lead-up to <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour that served as the emotional anchor for the song’s lyrics, tone, and title?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I was informed that this cour—without giving too much away—you can already tell from the PV that there’s a lot of battles going on. Because I was informed about that, I knew I had to make something that was very dynamic and impactful as much as possible. So I tried to lean a little bit more into the anisong feeling—rock rap with a little bit of metal in there as well. Just a touch of it, it’s more rock than anything, I think.</p><p>But in particular, I really wanted to channel Rudo’s rage. It’s one of the main things that got me into the comic and kept me reading—wanting to learn more about his story and seeing the results of his anger come to a head over time through his character development. At the beginning of the song, you may hear an iconic line from Rudo, except I’m the one screaming it. I hope fans will look forward to that for sure, because I wanted to write most of it from Rudo's perspective. But the song also includes a lot of hopefulness, as well as what I feel he has gotten from befriending the Cleaners. I hope that it will be a fitting second cour opening.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Urana/Hideyoshi Andou/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Was there any particular moment in production, whether it's a lyric or a riff, where you geeked out over singing?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>A lot of lyrics within the song draw from specific moments within the manga, and now the anime as well. I didn’t write all of them. I only wrote the English lyrics, but especially in the intro, I want fans to listen to that. There are some parts that I rap in the first verse that I think are very indicative of what Rudo’s inner monologue might be, so I want people to focus on those parts, as well as the screams that I do in the chorus that have this big ensemble feeling for this ensemble show.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did you read ahead in the manga or preview episodes from the second cour to get in the headspace of writing the lyrics for the song, or were you only given a concept of where the story was going to go emotionally to have to match that sonically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>By the time I got the offer, I was already caught up with <em>Gachiakuta</em>. Up until the actual production of the song, I just kept rereading it (maybe out of excitement as well). I was really hype about that. But of course, we also got requests from the production side as well. We had a formal meeting where I got to meet everybody working on the anime and hear their requests for what they wanted the song to sound like, including Urana’s request. I combined those with my own ideas and sensibilities about what I wanted the song to sound like.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="[MV] Wanted, Wasted - Mori Calliope x Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEHbF1PsLI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What was Urana’s specific request for what this cour theme would sound like?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> She specifically wanted something intense.&nbsp; Of course, rock is a huge part of the world of <em>Gachiakuta</em>, but she also wanted me to do a lot of shouts and yells as well.<strong> </strong>Interestingly enough, there was a song that I wrote a couple of years ago that I very openly said was inspired&nbsp; by <em>Gachiakuta</em>. She referenced that song of mine. It’s called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXwCOIwQZ18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanted Wasted</a>.” I wrote the lyrics in English for that song and created that song with <em>Gachiakuta </em>in mind. So she brought up that song and said she’d like it to sound like that as well my song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNF8FqzIMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult Following</a>” from my <a href="https://lnk.to/mc_PHANTOMIME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantomine </a>album.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a VTuber whose persona and aesthetic are deeply rooted in anime, what does it mean to you to have your voice officially tied to a series like <em>Gachiakuta </em>that’s being heralded as the next big shonen series?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s honestly a complete and total dream come true for me. Even now, it doesn’t totally feel real. I’m honored that Urana is a fan of mine, as I am also a huge fan of hers. That’s kind of how our friendship was born—from just being fans of each other. I feel happy and also lucky. The stars really aligned on this one. That’s why the production of the song was very difficult for me, because I wanted to make the song as good as possible because it means so much to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I think from here on out, even if I do receive offers for other songs, this was really my true end goal: to make an opening or a song for something that I love so much. So I’m just extremely happy about it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">wwww ナイス帽子ぺこ！！！</p>— Mori Calliope💀holoEN (@moricalliope) <a href="https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1949491897040601191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> You recently had a solo concert that you performed earlier this year. Is there ever a feedback loop between being a VTuber and a musician?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> In this industry, there are people who focus on one, the other, or both. There are certainly folks that want music to be their main image, but I think it’s a difficult path to walk because you need to focus mostly on originals and maybe some covers, and streaming should be supplemental to your musical activities. Then there are folks that want to focus mostly on streaming, being a personality. They might make some character songs, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p><p>From where I’m standing, I have always been a musician. I was a musician before beginning this career, and I’ve always wanted it to be central to my image. But I love streaming so much that I feel like streaming has also become very essential to who I am. So I’m a bit of a hybrid, I guess.</p><p>My hope is that from here on out, as a virtual artist, more virtual artists might be able to get these kinds of opportunities, because a lot of us are taking music very seriously and are working very hard to create music as our main activities. I’m looking forward to seeing what else could come from this opportunity that I’ve gotten here for the world of VTubers, virtual artists, virtual singers, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>&nbsp;Beforehand, anime was a niche thing no one really talked about, but it’s become a big thing everyone’s talking about. Likewise, VTubing evolved from being a subgenre of live streaming to becoming more commonplace. Do you see this kind of crossover, where VTubers contribute to an anime’s sonic identity, as part of a larger shift in how mainstream streaming culture and traditional pop culture media are blending together?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I feel like, as you said, [VTubing has] always been very separate. But now, because anime is becoming more mainstream, you see it happening especially from big shonen getting even bigger overseas—for example, all the people that love <em>Gachiakuta </em>as well would be a testament to that. Because VTubing is intrinsically tied to anime, I feel it’s a natural result of anime becoming more mainstream overseas and globally. Because of that, I feel that VTubing is also moving in that direction, and [especially] streaming on platforms like Twitch or YouTube, [which] are integrating our existence more into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m very much focused on the anime sphere of things. Anime and games are where I’m based and where I like to be. But I think that from here on out, more YouTubers that have an interest in hitting the mainstream will probably be able to branch out there for sure. We’ll see more of that happening in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | Official Cour 2 Trailer | Crunchyroll" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wId1ejSTvcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can hear a snippet of Mori Calliope's "Let's Just Crash" here.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What do you hope fans feel in their souls whenever they hear your theme song for <em>Gachiakuta</em>, both as a VTuber artist, musician, and anime fan?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I want people to remember this song in a similar way that I remember anime openings from my childhood. There are gonna be people out there who are kids that will—hopefully—remember this song as they grow older in the same way that I have with my past favorite OPs. If they could feel, as the song says in Japanese, “hope in the gutter,” then I would be extremely happy if this song could give people an outlet for their tumultuous feelings inside but still finding hope within the dirtiness and darkness of the world. That would make me extremely happy.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>fans can look forward to hearing Mori Calliope’s opening theme, “Let’s Just Crash,” in the anime’s second cour, which debuts on October 12 on Crunchyroll.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thankfully, it's not a "major" delay</p>

<figure data-uuid="30d0aa4f33500"><a title="Mina The Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30d0aa4f33500/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games' new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> was on track for a 31st October 2025 release, but it seems the plans have now changed.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the company's website, the "delay extravanganza" continues – with the team behind this new retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">Zelda</a>-inspired adventure having to make the "tough decision" to delay the title on Switch, Switch 2, and all other platforms, as "it's just not quite there yet". Fortunately, this delay isn't a major one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbesjrmwk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p>
<p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p>
<p>The game is <em>so</em> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p>
<p>- Finalizing design, art, and sound<br>
- Overall game balancing<br>
- Implementing localization<br>
- Eating cheese<br>
- Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there's no new release date just yet, but again, it sounds like fans won't have to wait too long, as it's adding the final polish to select areas to make the game "truly shine". The original launch date was previously revealed in August of this year, and alongside it was the launch of a free demo, which will even carry over save data to the final build.</p>
<p>Over the past month, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> have also been delayed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now, Google has just over two weeks once again — because the US Supreme Court has decided not to save Google ahead of its Supreme Court appeal. Today, the Court denied the company’s request for a partial stay, meaning the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">permanent injunction is still in effect</a>, meaning Google must do the following things <em>this month</em> or be in violation:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let developers set their own prices</span></li><li><span>Stop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation</span></li><li><span>Work with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores into Google Play</span></li></ul></div><p>Epic Games says the deadline for Google to comply is now October 22nd, 2025. “Starting October 22, developers will be legally entitled to steer US Google Play users to out-of-app payments without fees, scare screens, and friction - same as Apple App Store users in the US!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1975309212336238829">writes Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p><p>Google wouldn’t explicitly tell <em>The Verge</em> if the company now plans to remove the requirement for Google Play Billing, allow other payment methods, and allow developers to link outside the Play Store to app downloads, among other things, at the same time it’s still trying to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.</p><p>But spokesperson Dan Jackson tells <em>The Verge</em> that the company will comply with its legal obligations, and passed along the following statement:</p><p>“Android provides more choice for users and developers than any mobile OS, and the changes ordered by the US District Court will jeopardize users’ ability to safely download apps. While we’re disappointed the order isn’t stayed, we will continue our appeal.”</p><p>Epic did not immediately answer our questions about whether it’s now working with Google on the court-mandated Joint Technical Committee to figure out how to bring Google Play apps to rival app stores without jeopardizing that safety.</p><p>Google has said it will fully appeal to the Supreme Court for certiorari by October 27th, 2025 — but that would be after the deadline. The district court judge who originally issued the injunction, Judge James Donato, previously asked Google and Epic to explain how they’ll comply with it in his courtroom on October 30th.</p><p>It’s still possible that the Supreme Court might take up the case after Google’s deadline has passed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/793610/google-epic-android-supreme-court-stay-denied]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/megabonk-quick-review.1318063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk is a 3D survivors-like with a very <em>specific </em>sense of humor that has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/why-this-indie-game-is-going-viral">getting a lot of buzz lately</a>. I've played about 15 hours as of writing this, so while this quick look is more meant to share my early impressions across that time rather than being a full, scored review, I’ve already done plenty worth talking about. There is still a fair bit I haven't seen, but I got a little more than half the achievements and unlockables in that time, and I have been enjoying myself a lot. Adding an extra axis of movement does a lot to set it apart, and it's more than competent at all the usual conventions of the genre already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played these kinds of games before, the basics are pretty much the same. You run around and fight endlessly-spawning waves of enemies that get harder and harder as the time ticks down. It'll start with little goblins, and then you'll get goblins with swords, and eventually build up to some more dangerous stuff like ogres or giant scorpions. Every once in a while a miniboss will pop up and those add some variety and a nice little spike of challenge. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also shrines that let you summon powerful elite packs and even more bosses with the promise of greater rewards, and I always appreciate that kind of thing where I'm not going into a menu and turning the difficulty up, but I can kind of tweak the difficulty as I go based on the decisions I make in the run. I prefer that, honestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is common for these kinds of games, all of your weapons do their things automatically, whether that's a sword or a rocket launcher. The only controls you're worried about are movement-related. I like the variety and the bombastic attitude of the weapons. There are no two that feel overly similar, and they're all pretty fun to use in different situations. Getting the revolver and the missiles and stacking bonuses to the number of projectiles I can spawn is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course the most obvious and I think the coolest difference here is that Megabonk is built with fully 3D levels and 3D movement. You can jump, and even get power-ups that give you better jumps or double, triple, quadruple jumps which is a ton of fun. There's an item that makes all your weapons do more damage while you're airborne, which can be quite powerful. One of the characters, Monke, can actually climb walls, which gives him some big advantages.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a frantic but tactical loop of going fast while planning out your path carefully.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And this exploration and planning routes across steep cliffs, up and down ramps, is a big part of Megabonk, which makes every run feel interesting and challenging in some ways a lot of survivors-style games aren't. First off, to finish a level, you have to locate the boss gate so you can summon the final boss before the timer runs out and you're eventually overwhelmed by endless waves of ghosts. So there's that added need to get out and comb the map, unless you get lucky and spawn right by the boss gate which sometimes happens, and I like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then the second part is that the map is littered with breakable containers, shrines, and chests, and your power level is going to be directly related to how many of these you can hit within the time limit before you move on to the next level. So there's this frantic but also very tactical loop where you want to go fast while planning out your path carefully to avoid backtracking and tag as many points of interest as possible. Chests also, at least most of them, cost gold to open, and that price goes up every time you open one, so sometimes you have to know when to pass one up because it's not worth waiting around to farm coins when you're not going to be able to afford to open every single chest anyway. The number of considerations I have to weigh in my head to put together a really good run feels satisfying and like I can usually overcome at least a lot of the capricious force of randomness by playing smart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now I do have to talk about the humor, because it's one of the first things I noticed. The entire theme of Megabonk seems to be Millennial and Gen Z internet brain rot. And it's honestly hard to tell if – at the rist of sounding a bit mean or snotty – this supposed to genuinely make me laugh in a surface-level way. Like is this the straightforward sense of humor the developers were aiming for? Or are they doing a Tim and Eric cringe comedy thing, like the <em>real</em> joke is that it's kind of stupid on purpose? How many layers of irony deep are we? In the former case, it doesn't work that well. But if it's the latter, it kind of does.<br>Yeah, in 2025, I'm totally still sending my friends all the latest GigaChads. Remember him? There's an item that spawns "borgars." Dang, did John Hammond show up to pop your champagne after you dug that one up? (The irony is not lost on me that I'm using a reference from a 1993 movie to criticize how old this meme is, but it's a classic, okay?) There's a surprisingly safe for work boss called "Scorpionussy." There's a power-up that "claps cheeks." Practically everything you pick up is some kind of reference to years- or decades-old meme culture. It never got in the way of the gameplay for me, but there were a few times I thought my eyes were going to roll so hard I might sever my optic nerves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Megabonk currently only has two levels, a spooky forest and a deadlier desert, at least unless there are some secret ones I'm not aware of. But they do each have three different tiers of increasing difficulty. The first is just a single stage, while each subsequent tier adds one additional stage with a new boss that lets you carry over all your power-ups from the previous one. I do find the lack of changing scenery a bit disappointing. Those two biomes are definitely starting to feel repetitive, and I couldn't find anything like a roadmap that said the devs plan to add more. It's not labeled as Early Access either. But the three tiers definitely provide a good challenge and give me more room to push myself.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Roguelikes and lites</h3><p>Some of my favorite Roguelikes/lites from over the years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meta-progression isn't super deep, but it is meaningful and rewarding. Everything outside of a run costs a separate currency called silver that you can pick up on runs. Getting permission to buy new characters, items, and power-ups requires you to first complete an objective or achievement thematically tied to each one, which is kind of neat. Then you have the more straightforward buffs to level up like getting more rerolls or more weapon slots. I appreciated that you only have to pay for the ability to toggle unlocked items on or off once and then you can use it as much as you want, since I really like to optimize my loot pool going into a run in these types of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are mostly pretty simple in their design but enjoyable to use. I think my favorite is CL4NK who is a robot cowboy gunslinger that starts with the revolver and gets increased critical chance every level. But you've also got a skeleton on a skateboard who does more damage the faster he moves, and the ninja is also a lot of fun because he automatically kills any enemy who misses him with an attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as survivors-likes go, this is a pretty strong one. Especially with the added consideration of the jump button and the whole vertical axis, and the emphasis on route-planning and exploration, I found it had that crucial ability to make me want to start a new run as soon as I finished the last until it was suddenly several hours later. I'm regularly groaning at some of the uninspired image board humor, but I feel like I can sometimes appreciate it in an ironic way, and otherwise just ignore it. I'd say it's worth a look if you have an appetite for another one of these that isn't basically just a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review">Vampire Survivors</a> reskin. I just wish there was a little more level variety.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is quite clearly a Halloween game. The thing about Halloween is that there should always be a little bit silliness amongst the horrific and the scary, and Yacht Club Games' next retro throwback seemed quite well fitted for the season. It was so appropriate that it was even planned to be released on October 31st! All of this to say, yes, Mina the Hollower is delayed, and it doesn't have a new release date either.
</p>
<p>
"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet," Yacht Club Games explained in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a> announcing the delay. "This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." They also noted in the post that a new release date isn't being revealed just yet, as they're waiting until the game is submitted to its various platforms.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, it is apparently "so close to being done," and it sounds like it's only smaller things like finalising design, art, and sound, balance tweaks, localisation testing, platform testing, and the act of eating cheese that's holding up the release that was meant to take place this month.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this is definitely a bit of a shame as I have been hankering for something akin to the GBC Zelda games, and I love a Halloween activity given I am not too far away from my thirties and am very childless so trick or treating is not something I can partake in. On the other hand, as ever there are too many games - both Unbeatable and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> are launching in the first half of November, and boy howdy do I not have the time for either of them.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed Yatch Club Games find a new release date soon enough! And selfishly, one that's far away from other games I also want to play.

</p>

                <p>The follow-up to Yacht Club's indie hit Shovel Knight will have to wait a little longer, as the studio has announced that Mina the Hollower will be delayed out of its previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-launches-on-halloween-demo-out-now/1100-6532145/" data-ref-id="1100-6532145">Halloween release date</a>. While Yacht Club said this delay will be a short one, it isn't prepared to nail down an exact date just yet.</p><p>"This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower," the team wrote on its <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>. "The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine."</p><p>Though the delay is short, though, Yacht Club said it doesn't want to announce a new release date until it's submitted to all platforms. In the meantime, it's working on finalizing design, art, and sound, game balancing, localization, and testing. And eating cheese.</p><p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that," the studio said.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is Yacht Club's first original franchise after the breakout success of Shovel Knight in 2014. The studio has been busy in the meantime, though, creating loads of extra DLC campaigns for Shovel Knight, as well as developing and publishing spin-offs like Shovel Knight Showdown and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is inspired by the classic top-down Zelda games, with an art style that pays homage to that color palette as well. It stars a little mouse in a kingdom of animals, and as the name implies, she can burrow underground to solve puzzles and surprise enemies.</p>
